320000 i think ive hit third in two games in the big leagues
320001 no matter what its where im used to hitting obviously with ken being here there was no question over who was batting third
320002 this is the biggest trade ive ever been a part of in the middle of the season and probably the last major major trade like this was hank aaron from the braves to the brewers
320003 it was the best thing he was the best player on this team and was here for so long were going to miss his face were going to miss his name
320004 its not about what i want its about what the reds want
320005 plus it starts with you guys in the media people read what you say if you say bruce almighty theyll say we want to see bruce its the truth when people see griffey its the kid and its catchy griffey is the man he still is the man
320006 i talked to him and he told me to be myself and people will like me for who i am i took that to heart i want to be like barry larkin thats my idol itd be nice to have a c on my chest like larkin but i dont think theyre doing cs anymore itd be nice to be a captain a guy like griffey his shoes are hard to fill ill make sure to step my game up even higher than what im doing right now i think its about that time

320009 by next year at this time we may be saying rush who
320010 he bills himself as a conservative although thinking conservatives after an initial chuckle or two should want to put as much distance between him and themselves as possible
320011 his favorite technique for discrediting an idea with which he disagrees is to make petty personal attacks against the people who espouse that idea
320012 he is not a nice man and he doesnt pretend to be and hes nasty
320013 limbaugh reminds us of morton downey jr the celebrated tv hatemonger of a few years ago
320014 the black illegitimacy rate is raised the rev jackson and other black leaders immediately change the subject
320015 for years jesse jackson and others have decried children having children
320016 remember how much you love rush limbaugh mother and think of all the terrible things theyve said about him notice how no one ever criticizes rich lowry
320017 we have to penetrate the pickup truck market first and we have to leave the door open for whats coming next
320018 whenever something like that happens everything including baseball just pales in comparison your immediate thoughts go to the families the mothers the fathers and the children
320019 it was definitely an eerie feeling knowing that it just happened
320020 im sure it was much tougher for the guys here thinking about their families that could have been traveling that road or they live off that road
320021 because its so close if we had been in practice at the time we probably would have heard the noise
320022 it was bad thing we were following everything on tv in the clubhouse we were very sad about what happened it wasnt easy to concentrate on baseball
320023 we knew there were more important things going on but we were honored to play in that game i know there was a lot of fundraising going on
320024 fue alguien que intent demostrar que era una consulta ama ada
320025 intent demostrar que era una consulta ama ada y descuidada
320026 obviously its been a lot tougher than we expected and thats hard but thats just part of the game youre going to have your ups and downs
320027 we just need to try to get back on track we still want to play hard every day and keep improving everyones still loose and were just trying to have fun
320028 the one thing thats been right is that we dont remember those things we havent held on to what we havent done or what happened its the same attitude every day when we come in the clubhouse thats what makes the clubhouse fun its much more fun to put the previous day behind you
320029 a lot of the young players were looking at are inexperienced but i want us to keep playing as hard as we are playing i want to see the execution
320030 what i saw the last couple of days was unacceptable
320031 i want it to get better but i dont know if were going to be able to find a true closer by the end of this year
320032 i dont know if we have him here id say its a long shot that we do weve got to have somebody try to do it
320033 our partnership with guitar center gives us the opportunity to help an up and coming band by giving them every element needed to succeed like ozzy did for us when he took an unknown band called motley crue on the road we too are looking for the next generation s great rock band
320034 oh sweet a van and it has a back seat why didnt you drive it to come pick me up

320042 miss macrae are you hurt im so sorry i didnt see you there
320043 i daresay you bore the brunt of our unfortunate encounter
320044 i asked if i may escort you back to the party
320045 on the garden path i thought you might have been lost trying to find your way back to the house
320046 yes i was i mean i got turned around on the path
320047 i wonder if i might ask one favor of you miss macrae
320048 it seems you stepped outside just before we were to share a dance
320049 im fine its just the heat its unseasonably warm this evening dont you agree
320050 i meant before that you were afraid of something you went out into the garden alone and got frightened
320051 i go many places alone and i assure you i dont frighten easily
320052 perhaps then you should frighten more easily because the world can be a very dangerous place
320053 im more aware of that than youll ever know mr
320054 speaker nancy pelosi d calif and the democrats adjourned the house turned off the lights and killed the microphones but republicans are still on the floor talking gas prices

320060 kalau tidak negeri memilih smk walaupun swasta alasannya sma merupakan sekolah berkelanjutan ke bangku kuliah dan kebanyakan siswa tidak mempunyai biaya untuk melanjutkannya
320061 untuk angsuran berapa pun yang mau dibayarkan tetap diterima ada siswa yang membayar rp 5 ribu sampai akhirnya lunas ya kita terima saja sedangkan untuk anak yang tidak mampu dan itu ada surat keterangan kita bebaskan biayanya

320064 vamos a ver el ya est demostrando que est bastante mejor hoy ya ha trabajado bastante con nosotros en definici n en remates la idea como siempre con cualquier jugador es no apurarlo si se tiene que perder los dos primeros partidos que son el 10 y el 13 se los perder porque despu s reci n volvemos a competir el d a 24
320065 a apostar como apostamos siempre a la recuperaci n total de l y a pensar en l
320066 esperar que se sienta bien a adi y est en buenas condiciones si es para la primera fecha bienvenido sea el lo sabe y lo sabe el cuerpo m dico que yo jam s voy a apurar a un jugador para su regreso
320067 es un partido amistoso que no es tan importante a pesar de que es importante como son los partidos por los puntos o el del d a 13 por la recopa eso ya lo sabe l lo saben los m dicos
320068 vamos a apostar a que l est bien para que juegue continu tampoco lo voy a arriesgar si no juega el 10 y el 13 en ese partido a pesar de que es muy importante para todos jugar contra el barcelona y por ese trofeo pero nosotros tenemos que pensar en lo anterior que es m s importante y en lo posterior que tambi n es m s importante
320069 yo no lo considero a rodrigo como refuerzo porque ya estaba explic es un jugador que no se va por determinadas circunstancias pero que en cualquier momento tiene la posibilidad de emigrar por todo lo que es l como jugador
320070 contento porque est ac s pero no tan contento porque l estaba en un momento muy bueno como para jugar en europa o sea pensando en el jugador uno no puede estar tan contento

320076 we believe that politicizing the olympics does not favor resolving these issues and also violates the olympic spirit
320077 we hope that foreign reporters while in china will respect our laws and rules report objectively and help communication and understanding between china and the peoples of the world
320078 the determining factor in securing the success of the olympic games is to work vigorously to promote the olympic spirit featuring friendship solidarity and peace
320079 the key is to ensure that athletes from all countries will have a level playing field to compete fairly
320080 we need to ensure that our friends from the five continents can further enhance their mutual understanding and deepen their friendship during the games
320081 only inevitable that people from different countries and regions may not see eye to eye with one another on some different issues
320082 but i would like to let you know that since the lineup of the chinese table tennis team is already finalized and made public it seems that my wish could not be granted

320090 no offense none of the girls here are hot enough to work in chicago my hometown i dont know if you are or not ive only looked at your eyes
320091 the key is to try to get some stability in the price of homes which appears to be happening in california
320092 since california constitutes 25 percent of the housing stock in the u s any stabilization can have a profound impact on national averages
320093 by extension a stabilization in home prices is required before any sustainable rally in financials can be expected
320094 it is our belief that we are moving in that direction
320095 we think a temporary bottom in housing is at hand
320096 at last the carrying cost of purchasing a home equals rental rates a condition that should lead to more stable home pricing going forward
320097 whatever your mind can conceive and believe it can achieve
320098 terrorism is the best political weapon for nothing drives people harder than a fear of sudden death
320099 mossad provoked americas air strike on libya in 1986 by making it appear that terrorist orders were being transmitted from the libyan government to its embassies
320100 sometime in the next two four six eight ten twelve months there would be an event that would occur in the world that would be sufficiently shocking that it would remind people again how important it is to have a strong healthy defense department that contributes to that underpins peace and stability in our world
320101 s omeone walked in and handed me a note that said that a plane had just hit the world trade center
320102 even in the accidental crash scenario the military might be involved in some way rumsfeld needed to know
320103 w e adjourned the meeting and i went in to get my cia briefing
320104 sir i think your entire schedule is going to be different today
320105 the place where the buildings top leadership goes to coordinate military operations during national emergencies
320106 in the meantime he would get his daily intelligence briefing which was already scheduled for nine thirty
320107 fifteen or twenty seconds later just as daviss radio crackled with a message the door opened and rumsfeld walked out looking composed and wearing the jacket he normally discarded while in his office
320108 i couldnt discover what he was wearing inside his office that morning but normally he would take off his suit jacket and put on a sort of like a vest because he found it chilly in the office so i think he had time to change his clothes put on his going outside jacket come out
320109 there were the flames and bits of metal all around the secretary picked up one of the pieces of metal i was telling him he shouldnt be interfering with a crime scene when he looked at some inscription on it and said american airlines then someone shouted help over here and we ran over and helped push an injured person on a gurney over to the road
320110 given the time it took to make their way down those pentagon corridors each side of the enormous building is the length of three football fields rumsfeld was actually at the crash site for only a fraction of that period
320111 secretary rumsfeld was one of the first people out there after it happened
320112 theres example after example of heroism of people who helped at the crash site trying to help victims and get people to ambulances
320113 i kept saying weve got him but the system was overloaded everyone on the frequency was talking everything jumbled so i couldnt get through and they went on asking
320114 an air attack against north america may be in progress
320115 though most people assume that the chain of command runs from the president to the vice president the cold war bequeathed a significant constitutional readjustment in an age when an enemy attack might allow only a few minutes for detection and reaction control of american military power became vested in the national command authority which consists of the president and the secretary of defense collectively the nca is the ultimate source of military orders uniquely empowered among other things to order the use of nuclear weapons in time of war therefore rumsfeld was effectively the presidents partner the direct link to the fighting forces and all orders had to go through him such orders were supposed to be transmitted from the national military command center
320116 the operational center for any and every crisis from nuclear war to hijacked airliners
320117 in the event of a hijacking the nmcc will be notified by the most expeditious means by the faa federal aviation administration the nmcc will with the exception of immediate responses as authorized by reference d forward requests for dod department of defense assistance to the secretary of defense for approval
320118 what was rumsfeld doing on 9 11 he deserted his post he disappeared the country was under attack where was the guy who controls americas defense out of touch how long does it take for something bad to happen no one knew what was happening what if this had been the opening shot of a coordinated attack by a hostile power outrageous to abandon your responsibilities and go off and do what you dont need to be doing grandstanding
320119 had one or more calls in my office one of which i believe was with the president
320120 no one can recall the content of this conversation but it was a brief call in which the subject of shootdown authority was not discussed
320121 im quite sure it was a plane and im pretty sure its a large plane
320122 for 30 minutes we couldnt find him and just as we began to worry he walked into the door of the national military command center
320123 ensuring that the military fighter pilots had a clear understanding of their rules of engagement
320124 would have a better understanding of the circumstances under which an aircraft could be shot down
320125 until 1 00 p m hours after the last hijacker had died
320126 changed him from a half forgotten twentieth century political figure to americas twenty first century warlord on a day when the president was intermittently visible only rumsfeld along with new york mayor rudy giuliani gave the country an image of decisive courageous leadership
320127 pentagon attack came minutes after rumsfeld predicted there will be another event
320128 andrew cockburn author rumsfeld his rise fall and catastrophic legacy
320129 testimony of u s secretary of defense donald h rumsfeld prepared for delivery to the national commission on terrorist attacks on the united states
320130 the needs of animals humans and our environment on the same scale
320131 continuing to impede womens access does not reduce the number of abortions it just makes it harder for them to access a legal and safe procedure we believe that abortion is a legitimate part of womens health care and outlawing it does absolutely nothing to help us prevent unplanned pregnancy which is the cause of abortion
320132 if people never did silly things nothing intelligent would ever get done
320133 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
320134 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
320135 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
320136 we believe efca is a bad bill and we have been on record as opposing it for some time
320137 we feel educating our associates about the bill is the right thing to do
320138 we feel its important that our employee partners fully understand the implications that the employee free choice act could have on their work environment and benefits
320139 weve always maintained the termination was not related to the union and that there was nothing unlawful about an answer provided an associate about merit pay
320140 following the decision we were considering offering reinstatement but that is on hold since the union appealed the decision
320141 this is a david and goliath confrontation but we believe well have enough stones in the sling to knock this out

320143 this is a huge victory not only for yupik voters but for all alaska natives who want to participate in the democratic process
320144 the state of alaska has recently taken the first step towards complying with its obligations under the law but as the court recognized the states recent efforts to provide yupik language assistance are relatively new and untested over 30 years after alaska was first required to provide that assistance yupik voters will remain vigilant to work with the court to make sure the states first steps are not its last voting is too precious a right to be denied by bureaucratic neglect
320145 multiple voters in different districts and with different poll workers
320146 efforts to overhaul the language assistance program did not begin in earnest until after this litigation began
320147 it is time to turn the page on the discriminatory practices of the past and fully allow yupik voters and other alaskan natives the right to be included in the political process remedies including outreach qualified translators sample ballots and allowing voters to get assistance when they need it will provide these voters with some of the mandated tools they need to participate in the most fundamental act of citizenship
320148 any voter who requires assistance to vote by reason of blindness disability or inability to read or write
320149 since alaska became covered by the voting rights act over 30 years ago it has viewed its obligations as optional and nothing more than an administrative inconvenience to be set aside for higher priorities
320150 this order tells the state enough is enough yupik voters are entitled to language assistance for every election not merely when it is convenient for election officials

320172 doctor you have to help me i keep imagining that im a giant moth
320173 but im just a general pracitioner for a problem like that you need to see a psychiatrist
320174 doctor im just dreading this i almost think id rather have a baby again than have a tooth pulled

320187 one night i was roused from my sleep by a rap at the door and i heard the deacons voice exclaiming arise abraham the day of judgment has come i sprang from my bed and rushed to the window and saw the stars falling in great showers
320188 but looking back of them in the heavens i saw all the grand old constellations with which i was so well acquainted fixed and true in their places gentlemen the world did not come to an end then nor will the union now

320195 jack nicklaus isnt here so i guess thats a substitute
320196 because it would be pretty scary if it got a little panicky and some spectator or some of the golfers were too close that wouldnt have been an issue if a caddie had gotten too close
320197 the usga put some pin placements on us today that almost defy the imagination
320198 its just treacherous treacherous greens out there with some unbelievable pin placements
320199 im not going to comment about the golf course the usga should know better
320200 then i hit my first tee shot on 10 and walking off the tee my neck locked up
320201 ever since i made my announcement ive just not been able to get anything going
320202 id say today was like yesterday i play 15 good holes and then again i leave a few shots out there i just cant do that not in this type of championship its costing me too much and then i always have to do catchup and ive not been able to do that
320203 i kind of just managed my game today the wind was going different ways
320204 i birdied the first two holes it was nice to take advantage of the two par 5s
320205 and i managed to take advantage of another par 5 for a birdie i think anything in the 60s is going to be pretty good today
320206 i know its a record for me and i was hoping it was an lpga record i was going for the fourth at 14 but i ran it by from 30 feet i thought i hit a good putt went past it didnt even make birdie
320207 keluarga shock sampai sekarang belum bisa masuk rumah kami masih menunggu dari polisi kami belum tahu motifnya apa
320208 i feel my game is a lot better obviously the score doesnt show it but i know what i need to work on
320209 i gave it my best today and i felt like i did a lot of good things and hopefully that outshines the ones i made mistakes on
320210 everything went pretty smoothly out there i hit a lot of fairways lots of greens and made a bunch of 10 footers i mean just kind of the way you like to draw it up
320211 i didnt know what the course record was but i caught myself thinking about 59 at no 14 i had like about a 10 footer
320212 i thought if i birdie the last five holes i can shoot 59 and thats just the worst thing to think so i made par there
320213 i just woke up at wachovia went to the range actually past the range and went straight to the first tee because i wanted to hit off in front of nathan green because hes a really slow player
320214 if it was like it was last year yesterday i would have shot 100 he shot a 69
320215 i did try working once before and i didnt enjoy it very much
320216 im just sitting in a bar with my mate and he said you should go somewhere i went ive been everywhere theres nowhere i havent been he said theres got to be somewhere i said well ive never been to egypt so i went to egypt
320217 im thinking im going to sit back and look at a few pyramids and take a few photos and all of a sudden shes asking me this is the fourth dynasty of who it was like hanging out with your headmaster for a day at the age of 40 it was brutal
320218 i said i played golf for a living she just snickered and that was it like idiot
320219 to me him not being here is probably the difference between 38th and 39th so i dont miss him but im sure the boys up in the big money end they definitely notice a difference
320220 i hit a pole probably going about 35 mph it just jumped right out in front of me ohair cracked

320226 it was a bit degrading he said after having five bogeys and four pars
320227 it was pretty ugly i dreamt of getting to par
320228 i didnt have the ball position right and i wasnt making a very good downswing he said of what was wrong through his first nine holes
320229 i decided to knuckle down its been a real good run

320476 i know the effort of the people that are in the front office trying to do the best they can not only for the team but the organization at this point
320477 i think they take all those things into consideration ive been on teams where people hold you hostage because you are where you are and you have what you have you just have to be careful a lot of times they say the best trades you make are the ones you didnt make
320478 you cant force trades we hope these guys are going to be ok we dont know that the fact of the matter there were no guys starting pitchers in the marketplace the position players some we didnt particularly care for some we did like them but they were rentals we were not going to trade two premium prospects for rental players

320480 im sure if omar thought a move would have made this team better he would have pulled the trigger
320481 those guys have made some good moves they know what moves would help this team and what moves would set us back sometimes i think no move is the best move
320482 this team has been through a lot with what happened at the end of last year and the beginning of this year as far as toughness i think were a tough team with our injuries we might not have a lot of the names on the field but chemistry wise toughness and character were right there at the top
320483 thats never the question whether or not i have a contract or not its really irrelevant anytime youre in the position were in its competitive you want to compete you want to compete at your best winning now is definitely important for me im not looking down the road or anything like that
320484 i got a couple calls but other than that i was walking through the mall just like anybody else i went to watch a movie the dark knight

320486 i think they take all those things into consideration ive been on teams where people hold you hostage because you are where you are and you have what you have you just have to be careful a lot of times they say the best trades you make are the ones you didnt make
320487 you cant force trades we hope these guys are going to be ok we dont know that the fact of the matter there were no guys starting pitchers in the marketplace the position players some we didnt particularly care for some we did like them but they were rentals we were not going to trade two premium prospects for rental players
320488 ive never been a fan of making a move for the sake of making a move
320489 im sure if omar thought a move would have made this team better he would have pulled the trigger
320490 those guys have made some good moves they know what moves would help this team and what moves would set us back sometimes i think no move is the best move
320491 this team has been through a lot with what happened at the end of last year and the beginning of this year as far as toughness i think were a tough team with our injuries we might not have a lot of the names on the field but chemistry wise toughness and character were right there at the top
320492 thats never the question whether or not i have a contract or not its really irrelevant anytime youre in the position were in its competitive you want to compete you want to compete at your best winning now is definitely important for me im not looking down the road or anything like that

320519 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law

320523 we believe that we should try to let the first stimulus package have a chance to work first before we move forward on trying to get a second one
320524 i think that a lot of the aspects of a second stimulus bill that have been floated around arent necessarily stimulative
320525 important to help improve and increase stability and confidence in the housing market
320526 but the driving engine of our economy is energy and they have not acted on that
320527 but as they come back after their recess and realize that this is something that they really ought to do that could go a long way to try to help improve our economic outlook
320528 my attitude is that we can find some sort of compromise
320529 if it is part of an overarching package then i am not going to be rigid in preventing an energy package that goes forward that is really thoughtful and is going to really solve the problem

320560 the mechanism to solve the election dispute during or after the election should be separate from the election organizer
320561 otherwise it can be wrong for the principle of justice
320562 most of the government officials are members of the ruling party
320563 the more they work the more they serve the ruling party for example parliamentarians are working to speak for the people in parliament but the parliamentarians are speaking to protect their own party they dont think so much about the people they forget about the peoples concern they work for only their partys benefit
320564 the election this year was so much better than the election last year
320565 there was no violence but there was fairness justice equality and transparency there was no manipulating the vote as those political parties accused because after the election finished they counted the ballots at that electoral office even in the city or in the local level
320566 if you refuse to swear in you will lose your validity and your seats will be distributed to others
320567 we do not reach this situation yet we continue to demand for justice for cambodian people who lost their rights to vote because they were prevented from voting

320569 the arasu cable tv corporation was launched with a view to break the monopoly of some msos and redeem the lcos from their control but the corporation has miserably failed in not providing popular tamil channels so we have no other choice but to get signals from our msos

320600 gang of 10 senators who earlier in the day introduced a broad energy bill that also would funnel billions into developing renewable sources
320601 my attitude is that we can find some sort of compromise
320602 if it is part of an overarching package then i am not going to be rigid in preventing an energy package that goes forward that is really thoughtful and is going to really solve the problem
320603 we are not going to drill our way out of this problem we have 3 percent of the worlds oil reserves we use 25 percent of the worlds oil
320604 and what ive also said is if people are expecting short term relief because of offshore drilling then theyre not going to find it because we wont see a drop of oil for at least a decade
320605 so what i want to do is just to make sure that we are putting together the kind of comprehensive plan that is going to work and if you have a package that is offshore drilling only which is essentially what bush and mccain have been emphasizing then i think that that is not going to solve the problem and i would be opposed to that

320608 mortal finite limited suffering from all these constraints haunted by the desire for completeness human beings invent a power endowed with precisely the opposite characteristics with their faults turned inside out like the fingers of a pair of gloves they manufacture characteristics at whose feet they kneel and finally prostrate themselves i am mortal but god is immortal i am finite but god is infinite i am limited but god knows no limits i do not know everything but god is omniscient i cannot do everything but god is omnipotent i am not blessed with the gift of ubiquity but god is omnipresent i was created but god is uncreated i am weak but god is the almighty i dwell on earth but god is in heaven i am imperfect but god is perfect i am nothing but god is everything and so on religion thus becomes the exploitation par excellence of mans vulnerability to deception

320612 not only did it come as a surprise and a shock but now its put a big hardship for reasons that are unknown to me for eliminating the randall county fire department i dont understand and i dont know
320613 amarillo normally responded anyway so not much has changed other than osage fire department after today will no longer be dispatched to handle fire and rescue in randall county
320614 we have a great fire department and i dont think theyre going got notice a lot of difference i think theyll be highly impressed
320615 a good day to start obviously because it gives you a good feel where your team is
320616 i was pleased with the first day of practice i would like to be upset about some things and i am sure after watching film i will see places to improve but i like the teams demeanor and the way they came to practice
320617 such quarrying operations face large start up and marketing costs
320618 plus one of the biggest obstacles is consumer perception if the marble has an italian stamp on it you have almost instant market acceptance
320619 weve worked very hard and invested significantly in developing our brand as canadas marble with an eye to developing international markets
320620 now that were developing this strategic partnership in china were definitely going to be taking our model and looking at other opportunities for additional quarries across the province
320621 operations like macleod resources are creating good paying jobs in rural areas while maintaining a small environmental footprint
320622 theres also a lot of export and secondary processing opportunities if we can develop more of these types of quarries across the province
320623 the tendency is for people to just read the news and talk about the war
320624 that wasnt enough for me to be able to come out here and say thank you was important to me it made me really happy to see smiling faces thats what it is all about knowing i made their day
320625 my fathers a veteran my uncles a veteran my grandfather was a veteran i nearly went into the navy myself when i was 18 so i got a chance to go overseas and give the men and women of the armed forces a little bit of a respite

320627 we generally attend because most of the companies we deal with in the world are there so its easy to connect our people with our customers and potential customers
320628 its a good place to establish collaborative systems in the aerospace and defence industry

320630 this is great news for the entire aerospace industry and will have a significant impact on the atlantic region including new job opportunities
320631 bombardier is composites atlantics biggest customer and a key feature of the new c series is the extensive use of composite materials in its construction

320633 i remember rita didnt feel well for a long time
320634 it took her doctors two years to finally diagnose ovarian cancer thats why its known as the silent killer its so hard to detect
320635 i organized visits to the hospital when she was off for her chemo we had never seen a more fragile person and some days we couldnt cheer her up but we never saw her fall apart some people are devastated by this but ritas optimism is still keeping her healthy
320636 i was off for eight months until february 2001 and the employees here were excellent
320637 they always sent me little notes to keep my spirits up and phoned to see how i was doing they even came into the hospital to see me
320638 but it was a lot because we won a prize for being the team that raised the most money
320639 this year loblaw companies which owns atlantic wholesalers came out with a colleague volunteer grant program so that employees that volunteer with different organizations can put in an application
320640 my application actually got approved and theyre donating 500 to ovarian cancer canada as well as to some other organizations its great its so nice to know the company is looking into different communities and helping out different organizations
320641 my sister was kidnapped raped and murdered at the age of 13 years old
320642 the crime changed prairie village forever after july 7 1974 front doors were kept locked lizabeth wilsons body was found six months later the case went cold for 34 years
320643 it was phill klines determination which made sure that john henry horton is now in prison for the rest of his life
320644 as attorney general phill kline reopened the case and as your d a phill kline convicted john henry horton tested proven experienced kline for district attorney

320648 we are concerned that any issues that may have arisen if not resolved quickly will result in the passage of this years construction cycle and delay the walkways completion for at least another year this pedestrian walkway has been on the books for several years now with no construction started its a key connector between the residents of highfield and their workplace in greater burnside with pedestrian safety being a real concern

320655 this is utterly uncorroborated and at this point there is no reason to believe that al zawahiri has been injured or killed
320656 we are looking into the reports and will comment only after we have solid evidence either way
320657 he continued to live the lifestyle of a grad student no frills
320658 were looking at a man with a distinguished 30 something year career unparalleled and known around the world
320659 his career and his reputation are trashed and the fbi still hasnt said what they have on him
320660 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
320661 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
320662 we knew they were looking at someone we knew that bruce worked at fort detrick we knew he worked with pathogens

320670 serious problems that will emerge in bilateral relations if the bill is adopted
320671 it is not up to anybody to diminish or to begin to cut back on the obligations that the iranians have been ordered to take the us was committed to a diplomatic resolution but diplomacy had to have
320672 the iaea is not in the business of diplomacy the iaea is a technical agency that has a board of governors of which the united states is a member
320673 as i have said for five years this war is about oil
320674 the bush administration desires private control of iraqi oil but we have no right to force iraq to give up control of their oil we have no right to set preconditions to iraq which lead iraq to giving up control of their oil the constitution of iraq designates that the oil of iraq is the property for all iraqi people
320675 i am calling for a congressional investigation to determine the role the administration may have played in the hunt kurdistan deal the effect the deal will have on the oil revenue sharing plan and the attempt by the administration to privatize iraqi oil
320676 each day to save his own skin every jewish policeman brought seven sacrificial lives to the extermination altar

320684 police you shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life its inappropriate
320685 i dont think the use of military force is an attractive option but i would tell you i dont know what the alternative is because life is about choices i think we have to consider the use of military force i think we have to look at a limited strike against their nuclear facilities
320686 if we were to strike iran it should be accompanied by an effort at regime change the us once had the capability to engineer the clandestine overthrow of governments i wish we could get it back
320687 they iran got no response from the uk or the us if you were the iranian leader what conclusion do you draw
320688 to get into the specifics of your own internal politics here
320689 there is too much of a view in europe that you have passed beyond history
320690 that everything can be worked out by negotiation democrats or republicans we americans dont see it that way
320691 im not even a reagan conservative im a barry goldwater conservative they neocons have somewhat i would say excessively wilsonian views about the benefits of democracy
320692 john and i dont even remember how the capital l got used in the first place
320693 this is a big lie that the jewish people have lived with throughout history
320694 up to now these anti semitic canards have been heard on the fringes but to have two respected academics repeat them legitimises the debate and penetrates the mainstream
320695 visit any anti semitic website and youll hear the same old themes the jews have too much power they exercise political influence not as individual citizens but as a cabal
320696 walt and mearsheimer sound all the same notes with a subtlety and pseudo scholarly style that makes their poison all the more dangerous
320697 an awkward term as many of the groups and people in it dont operate on capitol hill its shorthand you could call it the pro israel movement
320698 we knew from de tocqueville this country is driven by conformity
320699 the law cant make people speak out it can only prevent people from stopping free speech whats happened is not censorship but self censorship
320700 he told me that if he did so for the rest of his career he would never be able to get a majority for what he cared about he would be cut off at the knees
320701 rooting out perceived anti israel bias in the media has become for many american jews the most direct and emotional outlet for connecting with the conflict 6 000 miles away
320702 the pressure from these groups is relentless editors would just as soon not touch them
320703 although such an attitude may afford a temporary relief and may quiet arabs for a short time
320704 it will certainly not settle the question as the arabs dont want the british in palestine and after having their way with the jews they would attack the british position as the moslems are doing in mesopotamia egypt and india
320705 uncertain arab world a well to do educated modern community ultimately bound to be dependent on the british empire
320706 were in the beginning stages of this case and we expect that there will be a lot more evidence to come in my tenure as an assistant district attorney this is perhaps one of the most unusual cases that weve been involved in
320707 its unusual to find somebody in the freezer i agree thats a fact thats going to have to be explained some way
320708 i was pumping gas one day thinking with gas prices so high i may have to take the metro
320709 first if a person uses public transportation such as subways buses trolleys or rail services the need to move to and from the public transit stops is likely to result in additional walking again decreasing weight
320710 second since the opportunity cost of eating out at restaurants rises when the price of gas increases people may substitute eating out to preparing their own meals at home which tend to be healthier
320711 the recent spike in gas prices may have the silver lining of reducing obesity in the coming years
320712 one person yelled at me so now im supposed to be happy about gas prices
320713 so like we took a golf club ehh up to the top of this mountain ehh then i set up a tee ehh then i looks out over the valley right ehh and im thinking to myself ehh wow this is going to go far ehh right ok enough ehh so i step back to swing ehh and i miss the ball ehh and then my pack goes over the edge ehh and im like ehh im f ked ehh and my buddies just laughing ehh

320716 is a trademark of iraqi leader saddam husseins biological weapons program
320717 only one country iraq has used bentonite to produce biological weapons
320718 there is purely circumstantial though highly suggestive evidence that might seem to link iraq with last falls anthrax terrorism
320719 detected an apparent anthrax leak in december 2001 at the height of the anthrax mailings investigation but did not report it
320720 the political and journalistic establishment suddenly seems united in wanting to attack iraq
320721 now that we know that the us govt believes that anthrax came from the inside shouldnt cohen be a wee bit curious about what this warning was based on
320722 theres either a significant amount of money behind this or this is state sponsored or this is stuff that was stolen from the former soviet program
320723 if the now deceased ivins really was the culprit behind the attacks then that means that the anthrax came from a u s government lab
320724 i am not so much disappointed as i am blinded with rage
320725 this is papa bear put out an apb for a male suspect driving a car of some sort heading in the direction of uh you know that place that sells chili suspect is hatless repeat hatless

320769 the first thing i smell is a piece of cheese
320770 lets get ready to rumble a have a mission to do attend
320771 the first thing i smell is a piece of cheese
320772 lets get ready to rumble a have a mission to do attend
320773 i am a democrat and here is my energy plan
320774 were just starting to talk about it but i think well do it this season
320775 an episode where the boys investigate a haunting at one of the high schools they used to go to and then flashback to what the boys high school lives were like well sort of see them played by 18 year olds and giving people swirlies or whatever the hell they did i dont know yet we havent worked it out
320776 were not really going to see hell except in quick flashes and those types of moments
320777 there isnt going to be like fade in hell dean being poked with a pitchfork its going to be more about his return to earth and what that does to you psychologically hes still dean but deep in his soul hes been in the worst pow camp ever
320778 the boys have never been able to keep secrets from each other before not since season one when they were separate so to have a period of time where they were separate and they can surprise each other again has been really refreshing and fun to write
320779 i think sam and dean are both more individual or at least more heady
320780 theyve both done things in the last four months that theyre kind of worried about i think as we get into the meat of the season between episodes eight and fifteen were really going to delve into what sam did for those four months while dean was gone and the pain that hes gone through his brother was dead he buried his brother and then had to deal with it for a couple months and deal with it however you know he probably did some things he wasnt necessarily sure about and proud of hes definitely more hard edged
320781 for the first time theres a lot of story mythology centered around dean
320782 a lot of it was about sam and being psychic and whatever and now theres mysteries about each of them
320783 i always figured dean would come back otherwise its the sam winchester show
320784 i didnt know how and i didnt know why i always figured it would be that they find a way to get me out and that i would go back to just being dean and trying to save sam from whatever the demons had in store for him but now that ive come back and i cant figure out why or how its really starting to play into the psyche of dean and what hes going to go through and how thats going to involve himself into the mythology of not just sam but the entire show
320785 ill be the first to say when certain episodes or certain seasons suck but im really excited about this one
320786 were giggling like schoolgirls in the writers room we think were on to something this year i think we have some really really cool stuff in store
320787 the primary purpose of which is the commercial advertisement or promotion of a commercial product or service including content on an internet website operated for a commercial purpose
320788 as pioneer works hard to engage the 12 volt community in raising awareness to the consuming public one outreach about which we feel strongly is charity pioneer is of course directly involved in a number of philanthropic programs however a way to build on that foundation is to recognize the good works of our dealers and the impact they are having on a local level
320789 drive in autosound has supported our troops in a number of ways
320790 including accommodation rates and financing for the local military community co hosting football parties with radio station kilo 94 3 fm at the community event center on fort carson military base and active participation in the military connection which welcomes soldiers home from deployment
320791 so were proud to support the service men women and their families at fort carson making sure that the children of military families have a good holiday is particularly dear to our hearts
320792 in 2007 we collected more than 5 000 in toys during the local toys for tots drive throughout our five store locations we are grateful to pioneer for helping us provide more holiday joy this year through its community give back award
320793 the hope and purpose of santas workshop is to make it possible for all soldiers assigned to fort carson to provide for their children during the holidays as one of the elves who assists our soldiers as they come through the workshop i can tell you how deeply our soldiers appreciate the generosity and support that colorado springs and its surrounding communities so selflessly give to this cause
320794 this year we are expecting 2 000 children in need
320795 and i was worried about the number of families who need our help you cant imagine exactly how much it means that drive in autosound chose our charity the smiles and squeals of delight from happy children will surely be music to many a soldiers ears this holiday season
320796 why should i have done anything the victim was already dead
320797 you know i dont know what i would have done i dont think anyone does until they are put in that situation
320798 i am not in direct danger but i could be if i stick around so its time to go
320799 im about to get hurt and there is no stopping it and my only change is to fight back
320800 i may be willing to buy a light bulb but come on adam are you asking me to forgo my human right to breed
320801 for a dime a day you could feed this starving child
320802 am i buying this car because i am taking an environmental stand
320803 yes but your paying a lot more for youre car than youre saving at the pump
320804 look at me consumerist i am defined by what i own new thing i may not be getting 45 m p g but im not getting 21 either im getting 37 m p g in an inexpensive reliable car
320805 you are the best of peoples evolved for mankind enjoining what is right forbidding what is wrong and believing in allah if only the people of the book had faith it were best for them among them are some who have faith but most of them are perverted transgressors
320806 watch out over there he doesnt think its fair that we all play together hed much rather never answer a newbies post other than with the utmost scorn and disdain its just too much of a pain to be monitoring the list and theres nothing that hed miss if it all stopped today the moment he went away
320807 wal mart was putting it before consumers saying this represents what about you can buy a stinkin gallon of pickles for 2 97 and its the nations number one brand
320808 wal mart is more powerful than any retailer has ever been
320809 one of the things that limits or slows the growth of imports is the cost of establishing connections and networks
320810 wal mart is so big and so centralized that it can all at once hook chinese and other suppliers into its digital system so wham you have a large switch to overseas sourcing in a period quicker than under the old rules of retailing
320811 people ask how can it be bad for things to come into the u s cheaply how can it be bad to have a bargain at wal mart sure its held inflation down and its great to have bargains
320812 but you cant buy anything if youre not employed we are shopping ourselves out of jobs
320813 cucumbers in the jar you dont make a whole lot of money there
320814 it was selling 80 jars a week on average in every store
320815 we saw consumers who used to buy the spears and the chips in supermarkets buying the wal mart gallons theyd eat a quarter of a jar and throw the thing away when they got moldy a family cant eat them fast enough
320816 and they said if you do that all the other products of yours we buy well stop buying it was a clear threat
320817 business was so indispensable to vlasic and the gallon so central to the wal mart relationship that decisions about the future of the gallon were made at the ceo level
320818 he said well weve done to pickles what we did to orange juice
320819 vlasic got to take it down to just over half a gallon of pickles for 2 79 not long after that in january 2001 vlasic filed for bankruptcy although the gallon jar of pickles everyone agrees wasnt a critical factor
320820 we are one of biggest suppliers and they are our biggest customer by far we have a great relationship thats all i can say are we done now
320821 the fact is wal mart perhaps like no other retailer seeks to establish collaborative and mutually beneficial relationships with our suppliers
320822 wal mart is the essential retailer in a way no other retailer is
320823 our clients cannot grow without finding a way to be successful with wal mart
320824 everyone from the forklift driver on up to me the ceo knew we had to deliver to wal mart on time not 10 minutes late and not 45 minutes early either
320825 the message came through clearly you have this 30 second delivery window either youre there or youre out with a customer like that it changes your organization for the better it wakes everybody up and all our customers benefited we changed our whole approach to doing business
320826 we are one of biggest suppliers and they are our biggest customer by far we have a great relationship thats all i can say are we done now
320827 are you meshuga why in the world would we talk about wal mart ask me about anything else well talk but not wal mart
320828 it would be committing suicide if wal mart takes something the wrong way its like saddam hussein you just dont want to piss them off
320829 they are tough people but very honest they treat you honestly
320830 it was a joke to do business with most of their competitors a fiasco
320831 wal mart has done more good for america by several thousand orders of magnitude than theyve done bad
320832 they have raised the bar and raised the bar for everybody
320833 they demand you do what you say you are going to do
320834 i woke up may 1 the heart of the bike production cycle for the summer
320835 i knew how high was up i was duty bound to supply my customer
320836 i conceded business to my competitors because i just ran out of capacity
320837 is tough as nails but they give you a chance to compete if you cant compete thats your problem
320838 they have such awesome purchasing power that they write their own ticket if they dont like your prices theyll go vertical and do it themselves or theyll find someone that will meet their terms
320839 they had awarded us a contract and in their wisdom they changed the terms so dramatically that they really reneged
320840 but when you lose a customer that size they are irreplaceable
320841 they leave a lot to be desired in the way they treat people
320842 their actions to pulverize people are unnecessary wal mart chewed us up and spit us out
320843 for any product that is the same as what you sold them last year wal mart will say heres the price you gave me last year
320844 the umbrella man scrimped and came back with a 2 increase
320845 they said well go with a chinese manufacturer and he was out entirely
320846 wal mart wont necessarily say you have to reconfigure your distribution system
320847 but companies recognize they are not going to maintain margins with growth in their wal mart business without doing it
320848 you need to bring wal mart new products products consumers need because with those wal mart doesnt have benchmarks to drive you down in price they dont have historical data you dont have competitors they havent bid the products out to private label makers thats how you can have higher prices and higher margins
320849 they are all very rational people and they had a good point everyone was willing to pay more for a master lock but how much more can they justify
320850 its hard to see how this relationship will boost levis higher end business
320851 its easy to see how this will hurt the higher end business
320852 at that price we no longer think its a good value to our shopper therefore we dont think we should carry it
320853 we want clean air clear water good living conditions the best health care in the world yet we arent willing to pay for anything manufactured under those restrictions
320854 when the difference is 1 retailers like wal mart would prefer to have the brand name padlock or faucet or hammer
320855 but as the spread becomes greater when our padlock was 9 and the import was 6 then they can offer the consumer a real discount by carrying two lines ultimately they may only carry one line
320856 they are all very rational people there wasnt a whole lot of room for negotiation and they had a good point everyone was willing to pay more for a master lock but how much more can they justify if they can buy a lock that has arguably similar qual ity at a cheaper price well they can get their consumers a deal
320857 i dont think so but even if we do i think we say heres a master lock for 9 heres another lock for 6 let the other guy pay 9
320858 se fosse homem ele poderia chegar para mim e conversar n o joguei porque estava machucado e os m dicos do clube podem atestar

320861 listen i think everyone hopes this will bring some luck
320862 eclipses were reported where none took place in areas of political or bureaucratic strife
320863 wed already known about this eclipse many years before we got the right to host the olympics so how can we explain this is retribution
320864 en redmond no se ven ni os de siete a os pidiendo en la calle

320870 el padr n es confiable en 97 lo que permite a los bolivianos ir a tranquilos a la votaci n
320871 then again prop 11 isnt really reform its just another scheme to change our constitution to give new powers over drawing districts to politicians bureaucrats and people picked at random people who arent accountable to anyone for the decisions they make
320872 it is an unwise and unfortunate move to cause economic strife to public servants and their families who are working hard and playing by the rules we are not going to let this decision get in the way of our mission which is to deliver a budget that reflects the values of californians
320873 were prepared for more on the downside and continue to be very cautious if we have a sustained recession gm and ford are in a heck of a lot of trouble

320887 suggested if we all inflated our tires that we would solve the problem
320888 d o you really think that inflating your tires is a rational energy strategy
320889 there are things you can do individually to save energy

320897 snubbing wounded soldiers by canceling a visit to a military hospital because he could not take reporters with him despite no evidence that the charge is true
320898 has resorted to lies and distortions in what sounds like an increasingly desperate attempt to slow down sen barack obama t hese baseless attacks are raising more questions about the republicans campaign and his ability to control his temper
320899 the mccain commercial on this subject is completely wrong factually wrong
320900 so is that your campaign you know shtick right now that he is sort of out of the mainstream elite
320901 honestly i dont think we are focusing on it youre the one bringing it up today
320902 newly aggressive campaign to define mr obama as arrogant out of touch and unprepared for the presidency

320909 this world has been connected tied to the darkness soon to be completely eclipsed
320910 it is nice to be ranked that high but this is the preseason not the postseason
320911 it means that we accomplished some things last year and that many of the players who did those things are back a lot of it has to do with the skill position players the high profile players we have back like cullen harper james davis c j spiller and aaron kelly
320912 if the rankings motivate our players and give them a sense of urgency to retain that ranking then it is a good thing but if they see the ranking and think they have arrived then we won t have the ranking for a long time
320913 we have good talented players on our offensive line but they are inexperienced
320914 the first game against alabama will also tell us where we are we will be going against nick saban a coach who has won the national championship he is an outstanding coach who will have six months to prepare for our offense

321028 the majority of bloggers and internet addicts like the endless rows of talking heads on television do not report

321031 i call on the state government to uphold the inherent social justice philosophy of the labor party and purchase homes from those people in our community who are suffering with this burden financially and mentally

321039 an average of 522 applications have been lodged weekly since the budget with 794 in one week alone
321040 this confirms that the government took the right step in bringing funds forward for this program and ensuring that they go to those australian families that most need financial assistance to install solar systems in their homes
321041 despite the scaremongering of the opposition in the 10 weeks since the budget we have seen continuing solid demand for this program and i am confident that will continue

321121 if i couldnt go to a tap and get a drink of water i dont know what id do
321122 i dont really give it much thought actually i figure north battlefords got to have clean water bottled water just doesnt taste the same
321123 big city water in this country is absolutely fine but the problem with assuring safe potable water is that it takes a minimum degree of microbiological knowledge and engineering skill and a supporting infrastructure
321124 doing that requires you have a large enough customer base so you can afford the high quality relatively expensive services
321125 ontario is a paragon of sanity compared to british columbia where you have a third of the population and 4 000 water suppliers
321126 every small town every little place has its own jealously guarded water systems most of which have inadequate treatment

321128 they can have effects on reproduction some pharmaceuticals estrogens testosterone some pesticides the endocrine system is the one that produces hormones and it is very very sensitive and there are chemicals in the water that influence the endocrine system of fish
321129 i think the reproductive effects are potentially important and we do hear about human fertility issues sperm count in males decreasing problems with learning difficulties in children allergies asthma cancers there are so many things we dont have an explanation for
321130 those systems will catch quite a few numbers of nasties like oils and very complex large chain molecules like pcbs they dont do well at all with these endocrine disruptors
321131 the more difficult issue is what combinations of common low dose chemical exposures might be contributing to these problems
321132 thats the test where we really saw the most striking effects with estradiol
321133 were aware the issue surfaced as an outbreak in nunavut in the past year and theyve had the problems with this in alaska
321134 so its something im keeping a close eye on and we want to find out more about how this germ is spreading and what the best approach might be
321135 the more water a household has access to their health status seems to improve in proportion to that

321142 after reaching a very high level with the previous engine we raced we had to put considerable efforts into the development of the direct fuel injection unit in order to significantly improve performance and efficiency
321143 in order to achieve revs of up to 11 000 with dfi technology it meant stepping into totally new territory
321144 we had already recognised the advantages of this technology at the start of the rs spyder project and adapted them to the very special requirements of motorsport always in close consultation with our colleagues in the standard development department the methods and insights we obtained from our co operation are of considerable value for future development projects involving dfi technology
321145 thanks to the substantial increase of energy efficiency theres no rise in the absolute fuel consumption despite the significant hike in performance on the contrary were even a bit lower

321174 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
321175 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
321176 we knew they were looking at someone we knew that bruce worked at fort detrick we knew he worked with pathogens
321177 its not like you might say the person gave off vibes that they might be a dangerous person
321178 this is utterly uncorroborated and at this point there is no reason to believe that al zawahiri has been injured or killed
321179 we are looking into the reports and will comment only after we have solid evidence either way
321180 if you are contacted directly by the igs office or gao requesting information of any kind please do not respond to questions or make any statements
321181 the clear intention behind this move is to chill the cubicles by suppressing any uncontrolled information
321182 our nations beaches continue to suffer from serious water pollution that puts swimmers at risk
321183 whatever has kept this ice shelf in balance for 3 000 years is no longer keeping it in balance
321184 inside the boardrooms at the major oil companies its christmas in july
321185 whats shocking is that big oil is plowing these profits into stock buybacks instead of increasing production or investing in alternative energy
321186 insult to the american people and to the system of checks and balances that are the basis of our constitution and our democracy
321187 this is utterly uncorroborated and at this point there is no reason to believe that al zawahiri has been injured or killed
321188 we are looking into the reports and will comment only after we have solid evidence either way
321189 and samantha actually got a treatment she touched up her black roots and did chunky streaks of blond
321190 im not giving up ill do everything i can to be ready for the first game of the season my goals for this season are to get over this bad luck and win trophies with inter
321191 why would i want to leave wigan ive enjoyed every minute since linking up with manager steve bruce again and i love the wigan fans
321192 if we are going to try to pull the ball back to his feet all the time then we might as well have just anybody there
321193 crouchie is 6ft 7ins tall and playing with him is a bit different weve got to use that height as a weapon its obvious he can head it bring it down on his chest lay it off all those things but we must get that ball into him
321194 hes a top signing and weve got to make the best of him im sure him and defoe are going to be a great partnership and get lots of goals but of course they will need the right service
321195 cristiano ronaldo is injured and anderson will be away at the olympics so we will miss them early on but apart from that the squad looks good
321196 the group has been together for a year now so we should improve and i am looking forward to seeing us do just that
321197 gary neville is back which is important and when you look at what wayne rooney has achieved at just 22 i think he could be one of the most influential players in the premier league this season
321198 i would be extremely happy if we can improve on last season although it is going to be tough
321199 chelsea have improved tottenham will be a good side so will liverpool and arsenal will be a threat even though they have lost a few players
321200 it is going to be a very exciting season in the premier league but i am sure ourselves and chelsea will be the big two
321201 you can lose a lot in three weeks and i have never found anyone who enjoys it your day pretty much consists of eat sleep and train but you have to try and build a base for the new season
321202 for a year or two at bayern we trained extremely hard
321203 in the last two games we have created several chances but either the opposition keeper has played really well to stop us from scoring or we have just missed the target
321204 there is no problem i am sure the goals will come and the important thing is that the players are creating chances
321205 when they have more sharpness they will score more goals at this stage it is all about preparing for the start of the season and i know that when the season begins my players will be ready
321206 last season fernando torres steven gerrard ryan babel dirk kuyt yossi benayoun and peter crouch all got double figures for us so i know we have the players to score goals
321207 we havent played the best football and we have not selected the best players
321208 its more about who you play for or who you are than your form i think that if you play for certain teams then you get selected even though youre not good enough
321209 because he doesnt play for certain local teams he doesnt get called up
321210 if you play for kaizer chiefs and orlando pirates then you get selected regardless of whether you are good enough
321211 it doesnt matter if youre from cape town or anywhere else in the country and it doesnt matter whether you cant speak zulu or xhosa or any other language
321212 where all that counts is that you have a south african passport and are willing to play then yes i think we can become a force but no this one doesnt speak that language so he cant come and this one doesnt meet this requirement so he is out that is hurting us
321213 ole is an inspiration to anyone hoping for a long career in football he has dedicated himself to his profession
321214 in the modern day game anyone who manages 10 years or more at one club is exceptional particularly when that one club is not from the players own country
321215 when a young kid walks in here eventually i want them to go home to their mother and father and be the same person it is not easy in modern day life
321216 success can change people so can money and this is in an industry which is very vulnerable
321217 when the fans show their respect for ole tomorrow it will not just be for his goal in barcelona
321218 it will be for his overall contribution over a very long period of time

321220 user interface innovation is a major part of the ongoing web revolution
321221 while the idea of being able to track and follow a conversation that you might have started sounds good i personally believe that centralising discussion is not a good thing conversations are by definition not bounded by time or space they happen here and there now and then it is an illusion to think we can centralize discussions social media technology and services have ensured that the conversation can take place anywhere thats the power of social media it isnt about media content or distribution it is about being able to interact anywhere we want it helps us to move away from destinations it helps the user and the conversation to be set free it enables what i call the user centric web the web where the user and not the destination is important

321242 raportul este slab metodologic nereprezentativ i mai ales submineaz munca pozitiv depus de societ ile islamice din toat ara
321243 raportul reflect deform rile i prejudec ile unui centru de studiu de dreapta nu reflect vederile studen ilor musulmani din marea britanie participan ii la acest sondaj au r spuns la o serie de ntreb ri vagi i tenden ioase

321255 go ahead and break the law put bumper stickers anywhere
321256 this news about bentonite as the additive being a trademark of the iraqi biological weapons program is very significant partly because theres been a lot of pressure on the bush administration inside and out to go after saddam hussein and some are going to be quick to pick up on this as a smoking gun

321260 repeatedly expressed concern to ivins that she may have been exposed to anthrax spores when handling powder
321261 if this is from the daschle powder it could be re aerosolized and somebody could get hurt really bad if its from ordinary culture its not that dangerous
321262 im not convinced i know the source of the contamination
321263 the message here from a scientific and policy standpoint is profound
321264 facilities that are medical and microbiological may not be suitably equipped for dealing with aerosolized versions of the organisms that they otherwise deal with in great safety these facilities probably ought not be located in a heavily populated area how do you contain smoke
321265 the chance that theyll be working in the same rushed atmosphere they faced at fort detrick is very small
321266 any defense lawyer should read this report carefully and keep it in mind when dna results are being quoted against his or her client
321267 i now understand why the fbi anthrax letter team is so fascinated by usamriid

321286 the first one came and said sir your mina has earned ten more
321287 well done my good servant his master replied because you have been trustworthy in a very small matter take charge of ten cities
321288 the second came and said sir your mina has earned five more
321289 then another servant came and said sir here is your mina i have kept it laid away in a piece of cloth 21 i was afraid of you because you are a hard man you take out what you did not put in and reap what you did not sow
321290 his master replied i will judge you by your own words you wicked servant
321291 then he said to those standing by take his mina away from him and give it to the one who has ten minas
321292 he replied i tell you that to everyone who has more will be given but as for the one who has nothing even what he has will be taken away 27 but those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them bring them here and kill them in front of me
321293 but those mine enemies who would not that i should reign over them bring them hither and slay them before me

321388 excuse me young man this is going to be a question and answer session so you can ask a question later
321389 why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african american community or black community in this country
321390 i think youre misinformed when you say not one time

321405 i dont really give it much thought actually i figure north battlefords got to have clean water bottled water just doesnt taste the same
321406 big city water in this country is absolutely fine but the problem with assuring safe potable water is that it takes a minimum degree of microbiological knowledge and engineering skill and a supporting infrastructure
321407 doing that requires you have a large enough customer base so you can afford the high quality relatively expensive services
321408 ontario is a paragon of sanity compared to british columbia where you have a third of the population and 4 000 water suppliers
321409 every small town every little place has its own jealously guarded water systems most of which have inadequate treatment
321410 the real problem with canadian drinking water quality is we have far too many rinky dink suppliers and theyre too small to produce the level of safety that our society seems to demand
321411 they can have effects on reproduction some pharmaceuticals estrogens testosterone some pesticides the endocrine system is the one that produces hormones and it is very very sensitive and there are chemicals in the water that influence the endocrine system of fish
321412 i think the reproductive effects are potentially important and we do hear about human fertility issues sperm count in males decreasing problems with learning difficulties in children allergies asthma cancers there are so many things we dont have an explanation for
321413 those systems will catch quite a few numbers of nasties like oils and very complex large chain molecules like pcbs they dont do well at all with these endocrine disruptors
321414 most pesticides and fertilizers that get into our streams and rivers never pass through a sewage treatment plant it is really really serious
321415 acid reflux occurs when the acidic contents of the stomach pass up into the esophagus and the sphincter muscle the barrier between the two has a defect so it cannot block the acid
321416 the lining of the esophagus is not made to resist acid its very different from the stomach so acid reflux can cause ulcers and inflammation and a whole host of other problems
321417 there are certain lifestyle things we tell people to avoid
321418 alcohol consumption increases the risk of acid reflux as well as caffeine so do foods like chocolates and tomatoes or tomato based products if you have mild symptoms and can avoid these things you might be able to avoid medicines
321419 the thing that should be taken away is that acid reflux isnt going to kill you
321420 why we actually look down your throat into your esophagus with a scope is because it can cause other problematic conditions
321421 el 55 del tr fico de narc ticos que se dirigen hacia estados unidos desde sudam rica atraviesa la regi n del caribe

321428 no me dejaron hablar con un abogado en 24 horas no me dijeron de qu se me acusaba
321429 estoy presa por mi trabajo profesional como cineasta por la informaci n que manejo por interactuar con activistas mapuches que luchan por lo que creen por entrevistar a personas de comunidades mapuches que han sido muy reprimidas y que no se atreven a decir nada porque s muchas cosas tan crueles que me llegan a enfermar el pueblo mapuche ha sido humillado ha sido perseguido he visto tanta gente aplastada emocionalmente siqui tricamente tanta gente que no se atreve a hablar por eso estoy presa

321441 no concierta con el r gimen imperante el hecho de que un tema en el que se encuentre planteada una cuesti n federal no merezca por limitaciones de fuente local el conocimiento del rgano m ximo de una provincia y s que sea propio de la corte suprema de la naci n
321442 las provincias son libres para crear las instancias judiciales que estimen apropiadas pero no pueden vedar a ninguna de ellas y menos a las m s altas la aplicaci n preferente de la constituci n nacional

321451 lautaro y freire son comunas de alta poblaci n mapuche y donde est n las bases fundadoras del partido lo que esperamos con estas candidaturas es acrecentar adem s nuestra base de militantes y posicionar a wallmapuwen de cara a nuestra campa a de legalizaci n ambas comunas son emblem ticas para nosotros y esperamos que al igual como sucede hoy con luis penchuleo en lautaro sigan surgiendo desde las comunidades liderazgos j venes que refresquen la pol tica mapuche y constituyan un real aporte a nuestro pueblo

321491 writing about this song a few weeks ago stephen m
321492 a rather visual folk rock ballad so much so that you an almost watch it as it happens it begins with fr berg singing and playing piano alone on stage halfway through the first verse the house lights rise to show a bluesy guitar and mor n in the background singing along blue gels color the soaring chorus casting a melancholy shade on their sunny harmonies marimbas enter stage left and eventually a full string section takes its place under the spotlights for the songs ending
321493 sweetly melancholic edge akin to that of simon and garfunkel
321494 the album frobergs second is certainly compatible with the work of other contemporary neo folkies but it also shows the strong influence of a veteran paul simon
321495 while jose gonz lez favors the mystical acoustica of nick drake and david crosby fr berg is more into simon amp garfunkel and belle amp sebastian melodies and lyrics follow models of classicism and romanticism but in this context given just enough lo fi scuff they sound more beguilingly elusive like half remembered dreams of times past

321533 with thousands of bees in a hive i assume that disagreement arises
321534 there are two common situations when bees will sting each other
321535 if the foreign bee persists in its efforts to enter the guards will attack and sting it however if the foreign bee arrives at the hive with nectar and or pollen it would generally be allowed to enter
321536 when a hive needs to raise a new queen they will raise more than one at a time however a queen will generally not tolerate the presence of another queen in the hive so the first queen that hatches will go through the hive and kill any potential rivals by stinging them before they hatch from their cells
321537 however when a bee stings another bee it will not die the tissue between the plates of a bees exoskeleton is much softer than human or animal skin so the bee can remove the stinger without losing it so when a bee stings another bee only the one that was stung will die

321561 now you know what its like in an asian country
321562 tagalog will not go anywhere tagalog will not disappear they are not going to forget how to speak tagalog
321563 the ustr came down hard on is on intellectual property they wanted to see prosecutions but were more asian the courts are used more to get a feel for the other guys negotiating position before going to an out of court settlement

321566 netshare is back on the apple store hopefully for good this time were not quite sure why apple took down the netshare application yet weve received no communication from apple thus far netshare did not violate any of the developer or appstore agreements to our knowledge it is unknown how mobile phone carriers may react to using the program or if they are even in a position to tell my personal advice is to not go nuts just yet by downloading tons also be aware that contracts carriers vary in what they offer from country to country please be careful your service doesnt have a metered limit that if you go over may incur extra costs for you

321578 the next time we come back to france we are staying there
321579 we have seen a marked increase in these graffiti tagging gangs taking to weapons and fighting to protect their walls their territory their name
321580 if we see someone calling the police then we target them
321581 you are trying to stop me from what i live what i believe in and what i breathe we are not going to let no one get in the way
321582 take a deep breath back off and call law enforcement
321583 i said if you are going to write on the wall write on your own wall
321584 they had a good meeting they agreed that the war on terror was one that we needed to fight together because the enemy is going not just after pakistanis but the united states as well and so our joint efforts need to be comprehensive
321585 we continue to work with the pakistanis to try to improve the situation
321586 it will be a pretty seamless transition for the depositors
321587 i dont remember much i had used too much drugs
321588 he confessed he cut her up and even photographed the body on his cellular phone
321589 the question of power has been settled by the elections
321590 it should be stressed that executive power will remain with the elected president
321591 there is a stink there its not about one retailer its about what has been going on at olg
321592 affirmed that iran as a state party to the npt nuclear non proliferation treaty has the right to have its fuel cycle program for peaceful purposes
321593 the ministers are of the view that sanctions imposed on iran for its nuclear program are of political nature and should be promptly removed
321594 they further affirm that with increased cooperation of iran with the agency to resolve all remaining issues about its past and present nuclear activities the issue of iranian nuclear program should be solely dealt with within the agency framework and there is no legal basis that the un security council proceeds in this regard
321595 the un security council has been clear on irans obligations the iaea has been clear that iran has not been transparent
321596 and now they cant even get their friends from the nam to come out in support of their interpretation of their program it actually reinforces just how isolated they are
321597 but if such violations carry on and then we start retaliatory action the ceasefire is over the defence ministers warning can be said to be in preparation for that
321598 a soldier in a track suit with a white flag in his hand was leading them and they were around 200 metres inside our territory when our patrol saw them we did not open fire because they were carrying that flag
321599 the way in which the attack in ahmedabad took place the multiplicity of the bombs and the way in which they were coordinated suggests a level of expertise not yet associated with any indian group
321600 it is reasonable to say this group has benefited from external involvement
321601 i think the effort of both sides will be to see that even if there is no breakthrough there is no break off
321602 both countries will aim to keep the dialogue process alive
321603 the level of trust that had been slowly built up over the past four years has been affected
321604 this in turn will affect the content of the dialogue process
321605 i wondered is it true that he wants to travel the world get to know the people and talk to them even though we cannot vote
321606 it is true i felt kind of like he was talking to me and not the cameras
321607 in some places the church is ridiculed as the gay church so membership is lost it is experienced as a new form of colonisation
321608 it is seen as leading to sexual license bishops cannot be a symbol for unity when their consecration divides the church in some regions the issue has become a basis for hostile actions
321609 had no idea their action had caused such a negative impact
321610 the revisionists push upon us the view that current secular culture and not the bible should shape our mission and morals
321611 everywhere we go we meet gay and lesbian activists receive their newsletters or read about their events they seem to be supported by north american churches they are determined that their way is the only right way
321612 we are very proud of his majesty he was under pressure to change and he has
321613 in fact he has done more than we could have hoped for
321614 slavikus 1 2008 21 46 installer 4 is going to come out from ripdev and nullriver in the near future so we can sell kate and the tethering program that applestore just put down its going to cost 24 99 euros with 1 year upgrades which will eventually be 2 months since apple is changing the frameworks again in 2 1 firmware where we are going to charge 15 euros for old customers and 25 for the new the icons in the new installer are going to be awsome though

321618 the people who lived through love canal need to know what their risks are and what they might expect for their children
321619 the state health department is proud of the work we have done on love canal over the years
321620 we have included experts on the studys advisory committee and community consultants who were former love canal residents we have issued newsletters on our progress met numerous times in open meetings and have strived to be straightforward and open
321621 the red sox will have no announcement tonight there are still issues to be finalized
321622 theo reached out to me in midmorning and wanted to gauge our interest and i said you know what we have an interest then we probably spent the next two plus hours hammering it out this wasnt on the board for very long
321623 from a personal standpoint im sad because i got to know manny
321624 but at the same time i feel its for the best not only for him but for us as a team like manny said lets turn the page and move on we are a good team and we are still capable of winning and we know what it takes to bring another ring for the city
321625 but he is not fully responsible for his acts because he was taking drugs nonstop during the four days prior to the killing
321626 my mum had paid for the ticket home and we were looking forward to having her back
321627 he met her out there they were not a couple they had only known each other for a short time
321628 im not sure i have a good answer for that ive been in the job for 30 days and asked myself that when i reviewed the findings
321629 im not going to say theres never ever going to be a point where that would not be a goal but not at this point
321630 im not surprised at the outrage i just didnt see it coming
321631 they are on the right track i dont want to disrupt that at this point
321632 the report demonstrates dhs as an agency in total meltdown and freefall
321633 if you are trying to persuade people to do something or buy something it seems to me you should use their language the language in which they think
321634 its not a buzzword or mysterious new advertising tactic its about raising your strategic planning to a level that matches the evolution of the world wide web
321635 hey my brother is selling a macbook i think it is a macbook pro
321636 when you look at how people use technology embedded systems mobile computing mobile internet devices servers super computing in almost every aspect of technology linux is emerging as the dominant platform
321637 when you aint got nothin you aint got nothin to lose
321638 at the time we started it no one else was doing it
321639 there wasnt a lot of reliable information out there about the flu
321640 we thought the contributions ought to be put together by everyone because something as wide ranging as a pandemic involves more than just the health department
321641 if you have to close the schools down in a pandemic parents have to know where to pick up their kids they need to know where they can get food and electricity it goes well beyond the virus itself
321642 one of the things we have accomplished is pushing governmental entities to be more transparent
321643 im not sure there would have even been a pandemicflu gov if it hadnt been for our site
321644 this is the wisdom of crowds everyone gets a chance to look at it if theres false information it needs to be corrected
321645 it was started to share information between associates in cardiology
321646 i didnt intend it to be shared throughout the world but it took on a life of its own
321647 its something that has potential to provide up to date medical information
321648 i have a wall of textbooks but sometimes you need more current information a textbook costs us 300 and by the time it comes out its out of date
321649 medicine has lagged behind other professions in its use of technology
321650 whatever we can do to make things more efficient we should do
321651 i wanted to use the power of a wiki for surgical knowledge
321652 doctors need an online resource that they can access at any time in a hospital in the old days they would rely on books but these get out of date and pages go missing so a wiki provides a great opportunity to close that information gap
321653 they have to submit a cv curriculum vitae of their credentials be approved by the site editors and also confirm their e mail address when an article is posted it can be approved by an editor and this status is shown
321654 im going to go with no comment with that one
321655 saat ini pemerintah sudah melatih sebanyak sebanyak 24 000 taruna siaga bencana tagana menyiapkan logistik dan anggaran
321656 pembangunan sistem itu didukung dengan berbagai persiapan mulai dari personil logistik maupun anggaran
321657 inilah ending misteri kelud yang telah kita pantau sejak september lalu selama ini kita meraba raba bagaimana bentuk sumbat lava yang telah mengganjal terjadinya letusan sejak krisis kemarin
321658 ini berarti masih dibutuhkan tenaga yang jauh lebih besar dari dalam perut gunung untuk mengangkat seluruh sumbat itu ke atas
321659 inilah yang kita sebut dengan letusan gunung kelud yang sesungguhnya
321660 hujan abu kali ini sangat besar persis seperti ketika kelud meletus pada 1990 lalu kami menyangka gunung kelud benar benar meletus
321661 sampai saat ini status gunung itu masih siaga dan tidak ada peningkatan yang berarti
321662 masyarakat jangan mendekati sampai radius 3 km untuk amannya lebih baik menjauh saya juga sudah minta seluruh satuan koordinasi pelaksana satkorlak dan satuan pelaksana kota madya kabupaten di banten menjaga warga masingmasing wilayahnya
321663 el espionaje con el objeto de allanar el derecho a la privacidad del ser humano venga de donde venga es mala as como de la violencia
321664 pujian kepala negara itu harus dapat dipertanggungjawabkan dengan meningkatkan profesionalisme dalam membantu tugas kemanusiaan
321665 kita masih mencari waktu yang tepat kapan dan di mana penghargaan itu bisa diserahkan kepada anggota tagana yang berhak menerimanya
321666 uno de los temas tratados en el encuentro fue el trabajo de la asamblea constituyente y el proyecto de la nueva constituci n donde se ha visto buenos avances en cuanto a los derechos ind genas por ejemplo en cuanto a la protecci n de nuestro territorio y de los recursos naturales que se encuentran en ellos
321667 garantizar que la propuesta de nueva constituci n se concretice y se pueda ir avanzando en la nueva normativa que debe regir al pa s sobre todo en temas que nos interesan como las autonom as ind genas la participaci n pol tica el respeto a la identidad cultural tomando en cuenta los acuerdos internacionales como el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas y la declaraci n de los derechos de los pueblos ind genas de la onu
321668 penanggulangan bencana adalah suatu proses yang tidak diketahui kapan mulainya dan kapan berakhirnya
321669 el presidente quiere un nivel de votaci n de m s del 54 es decir si 46 lo apoya y 53 est en contra entonces el 46 que es la minor a se impone sobre el 53 eso hemos corregido en el proyecto de ley b sicamente es que la mayor a prevalece sobre la minor a ese es el principio no tendr a sentido un refer ndum al rev s
321670 todas esas modificaciones planteadas por la oposici n nos demuestran que podemos un y el mnr no quieren dejar el cargo solo quieren perjudicar el proceso de cambio para seguir detentando el poder econ mico y pol tico por eso es que la modificaci n en el senado va a ser rechazada en diputados y en el congreso se va a definir todo
321671 he pedido esta entrevista con canal 7 y otros medios de comunicaci n para agradecer la pueblo boliviano por participar en la gran campa a de solidaridad y con el pueblo del beni especialmente con las familias afectadas por las inundaciones en diferentes municipios y departamentos

321674 yang berupa letusan gunungapi yang diikuti oleh adanya awan panas lontaran material pijar abu dan debu vulkanik
321675 tenemos nuestros puntos de vista y tenemos la capacidad de dejar sin qu rum al congreso cuando queramos por lo tanto es claro que ac tiene que haber alguna racionalidad en la aprobaci n del proyecto revocatoria de mandato
321676 esa t ctica ya no va a suceder y ellos mas saben que no va a suceder la elecci n del presidente del senado hace pocas semanas es una demostraci n que no estamos dispuestos a que vuelvan a hacer lo que quieran
321677 la comisi n ha concluido la aprobaci n del proyecto de ley en todas sus estaciones y este proyecto ha sido remitido al pleno ha sido aprobado en grande con oposici n abierta del mas no obstante de eso esa ley la vayamos a aprobar
321678 porque saben que el pueblo no va ha cometer dos veces el error de ratificar en sus cargos a los prefectos que se oponen al cambio
321679 todas esas modificaciones planteadas por la oposici n nos demuestran que podemos un y el mnr no quieren dejar el cargo no quieren revocatoria de mandato y solo quieren perjudicar el proceso de cambio para seguir detentando el poder econ mico y pol tico
321680 cuando estamos en el pa s literalmente con el agua al cuello y en momento grave por las fuerzas que buscan fracturar la unidad del pa s los sectores laborales a la cabeza de la cob determinaron al final sumarse a estos sectores divisionistas
321681 la transnacional exxon mobil tambi n fund el american enterprise institute aei el cual enviaba cartas a economistas y cient ficos ofreciendo 10 mil d lares adem s de gastos de viaje y pagos adicionales a quien escribiera art culos que enfatizaran los defectos del informe del panel internacional para el cambio clim tico
321682 el aei ha recibido m s de 1 6 millones de d lares de la petrolera estadounidense y m s de 21 personas de su plantilla han trabajado como asesores para la actual casa blanca el ex presidente de exxon mobil es actualmente vicepresidente del patronato de ese centro de estudios
321683 el american entreprise institute es algo m s que un think tank ya que funciona como la cosa nostra intelectual de la administraci n bush son los vicarios de la casa blanca en los ltimos estertores de la campa a negacionista del cambio clim tico han perdido la batalla cient fica han perdido la batalla tica y lo nico que les queda es una maleta llena de dinero
321684 saya curiga asap putih yang di bawahnya berwarna hitam adalah efek dari naiknya sumbat magma krisis kemarin ternyata masih tidak cukup kuat untuk menjebol sumbat itu dan hanya mengangkatnya ke atas
321685 saya berdoa skenario kedua inilah yang akan terjadi namun kami masih akan mempelajari hingga tiga hari ke depan untuk memastikan skenario yang paling mungkin terjadi
321686 parameter yang kami pakai sudah tidak berlaku lagi di kelud ini fenomena baru yang tidak pernah terjadi sebelumnya
321687 jika kalian menganggap keluarnya gas dan asap sebagai letusan silakan saja tapi kalau dimaknai dengan keluarnya material berupa magma itu belum terjadi
321688 sampai sekarang kami sudah tidak bisa memantau peningkatan suhu air kawah di tiga kedalaman ini cukup menyulitkan kami dalam melakukan pemantauan
321689 memang susah memberikan pengertian kepada warga tentang ancaman letusan ini tetapi kami tidak akan pernah berhenti mencoba
321690 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection

321695 something which has never occurred since time immemorial a young woman did not fart in her husbands lap
321696 how do you entertain a bored pharaoh you sail a boatload of young women dressed only in fishing nets down the nile and urge the pharaoh to go catch a fish
321697 never use clips on the end of the bar when you bench press because if you get stuck at the bottom position you can just tip the bar to one side and the weights will fall off and then you can tip the bar to the other side to get the rest of the weights off just be careful

321701 claro que animo a las parejas casadas a rezar para que tengan una buena y feliz vida sexual para ellos es un medio de acercarse a dios
321702 la gente est un poco sorprendida al principio pero agradablemente sorprendida
321703 si crees en dios crees que dios est presente en la vida en el amor en el matrimonio y en la sexualidad parece natural hablar de sexo y suprimir algunos tab es y etiquetas del pecado
321704 el amor de una pareja casada expresado en el sexo acerca el cuerpo humano al cielo el xtasis de una relaci n sexual puede compararse a la alegr a de la vida eterna
321705 por eso este acto conyugal permite a los esposos empezar a entender la dulzura del encuentro con dios

321752 he called me 10 minutes later and told me to bring cadaver bags so right there my stomach just dropped
321753 they were dead there were 23 of them we did send one to the hospital but it did not make it
321754 finding three alive makes me wonder how many more were alive and had to die like this
321755 we are not sure how long they were sitting out there before the person who found them saw them
321756 right now i am hoping it is just coincidence we do not want to see a trend like this

321772 this decision should send a clear signal to the that it must cooperate fully with congress and that former administration officials harriet miers and karl rove must testify before congress
321773 i have not yet talked with anyone at the white house and dont expect that this matter will be finally resolved in the very near future
321774 harriet miers is not immune from compelled congressional process she is legally required to testify pursuant to a duly issued congressional subpoena
321775 that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law
321776 if the administration appeals the ruling our congressional prerogatives will once again be put at risk
321777 we look forward to the white house complying with this ruling and to scheduling future hearings with ms miers and other witnesses who have relied on such claims
321778 we hope that the defendants will accept this decision and expect that we will receive relevant documents and call ms miers to testify in september
321779 i look forward to working with the white house and the justice department to coordinate the long overdue appearances
321780 im sure it will be appealed and it will go on into next year and it will become a moot issue

321803 you notice that i havent seen an ad yet where he talks about what hes gonna do and the reason is because those folks know they dont have any good answers they know theyve had their turn over the last eight years and made a mess of things they know that youre not real happy with them
321804 and so the only way they figure theyre going to win this election is if they make you scared of me so what theyre saying is well we know were not very good but you cant risk electing obama you know hes new hes doesnt look like the other presidents on the currency you know hes got a hes got a funny name

321894 to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations organizations or persons he determined planned authorized committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on september 11
321895 whether or not they can be linked to the specific terror incidents of sept 11
321896 equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury such as organ failure impairment of bodily function or even death
321897 do not apply to the presidents detention and interrogation of enemy combatants
321898 this is a highly classified area but i have to say that all you need to know there was a before 9 11 and there was an after 9 11 after 9 11 the gloves came off
321899 is for the parties themselves to try their own alleged war criminals indeed there are substantial arguments that the fullest cathartic impact of the prosecutorial approach to war crimes occurs when the responsible population itself comes to grips with its past and administers appropriate justice
321900 working group report on detainee interrogations in the global war on terrorism
321901 in order to respect the presidents inherent constitutional authority to manage a military campaign the statutory prohibition against torture must be construed as inapplicable to interrogations undertaken pursuant to his commander in chief authority
321902 the congress shall have power to declare war and make rules concerning captures on land and water
321903 regrettably testimonies from recently released detainees held at camp cropper and abu ghraib prison do not suggest that conditions of detention have improved
321904 a number of reports of cases of detainees who have died in custody mostly as a result of shooting by members of the coalition forces
321905 alleged that he was subjected to beatings and electric shocks
321906 the 2003 protests came after maj gen geoffrey miller took command with a mandate to get more information from the prisoners
321907 the practice of keeping persons deprived of their liberty note without any charges trial or right to counsel or any other contact with the outside world completely naked in totally empty concrete cells and in total darkness
321908 has been developed by military or cia lawyers vetted by justice departments office of legal counsel and depending on the particular issue approved by white house general counsels office or the president himself
321909 encouraged physical coercion and sexual humiliation of iraqi prisoners in an effort to generate more intelligence about the growing insurgency in iraq
321910 the issue is that since 9 11 weve changed the rules on how we deal with terrorism and created conditions where the ends justify the means you dont keep prisoners naked in their cell and then let them get bitten by dogs this is sick
321911 almost 10 000 prisoners from president george w bushs so called war on terror are being held around the world in secretive american run jails and interrogation centres similar to the notorious abu ghraib prison
321912 dozens of videotapes of american guards allegedly engaged in brutal attacks on guantanamo bay detainees have been stored and catalogued at the camp if the allegations are proven they will provide final proof that brutality against detainees has become an insitutionalised feature of americas war on terror
321913 t he united states is facing an historic defeat in iraq a blow to american power more damaging than it suffered in vietnam and far larger in its global implications the inescapable implication of currently available evidence is that the use of torture by us forces was not an aberration but a practice sanctioned at the highest levels abuse on the scale suggested by the red cross report cannot be accounted for by any mere lapse in discipline or the trailer park mentality of some american recruits it was inherent in the american approach to war
321914 the military lawyers believed some of those techniques went too far other officials said
321915 to request that you appoint a special counsel to investigate whether high ranking officials within the bush administration violated the war crimes act by approving the use of torture techniques banned by international law
321916 by a few american troops who disregarded our country and disregarded our values
321917 strangulation beatings placement of lit cigarettes into the detainees ear openings
321918 concluded the president can legally order interrogators to abuse or even kill terrorist suspects in the interests of national security
321919 each new revelation makes it more clear that the inhumanity at abu ghraib grew out of a morally dubious culture of legal expediency and a disregard for normal behavior fostered at the top of this administration
321920 under the doctrine of command responsibility officials can be held resoponsible for war crimes committed by their subordinates even if they did not order them so long as they had control over the perpetrators had reason to know about the crimes and did not stop them or punish the criminals moreover the abuses seem to have been more than isolated actions instead they now appear to be part of an explicit policy of coercive interrogations conducted around the globe and supported by justice department and white house lawyers who argued in 2002 and 2003 that the geneva conventions and other domestic and international bans on torture did not apply in these cases
321921 in a press conference thursday june 10 president bush said his instructions were that anything we did would conform to us law and would be consistent with international treaty obligations but the administration memos that have become public argued that us laws do not flatly prohibit torture
321922 we have long since made clear that a state of war is not a blank check for the president
321923 almost unconscious on the floor with a pile of hair next to him
321924 through a process of redefinition largely overseen by mr gonzalez himself a practice that was once a clear and abhorrent violation of the law has become in effect the law of the land shortly after the 9 11 attacks americans began torturing prisoners and they have never really stopped mr gonzalez is unfit because the slow river of litigation is certain to bring before the next attorney general a raft of torture cases that challenge the very policies that he personally helped devise and put into practice he is unfit because while the attorney general is charged with upholding the law the documents show that as white house counsel mr gonzalez in the matter of torture helped his client to concoct strategies to circumvent it and he is unfit finally because he has rightly become the symbol of the united states fateful departure from a body of settled international law and human rights practice for which the country claims to stand one does not teach democracy or freedom through torture by using torture we americans transform ourselves into the very caricature our enemies have sought to make of us
321925 among the procedures approved by the document was waterboarding in which a subject is made to believe he might be drowned at times their discussion included an assessment of whether specific measures on a detainee by detainee basis would cause such pain as to be considered torture
321926 but case after case was closed with us troops facing no charges or only minimal punishment the documents internal reports from more than 50 criminal investigations challenge the governments claims last year that photographed abuses at abu ghraib were the isolated pranks of a few low ranking soldiers
321927 independent human rights organizations amnesty international and human rights watch and two of americas most respected investigative reporters mark danner and seymour hersh have all concluded in detailed investigations that torture of prisoners was authorized at the highest levels of command
321928 the prisoners arms were stretched behind him in a way the guard never had seen before
321929 blood gushed from his mouth as if a faucet had been turned on
321930 to clarify his remarks but no official would agree to be named

321948 kb you really need to get your obsessive compulsive disorder taken care of
321949 reminds me of an old joke an oldie but goodie
321950 did you hear about the founder of the mormon cult named joseph smith who
321951 krappinghisbeard takes one statement literally such as chopping off their balls and then uses the atomic bomb as a metaphor for terrorism
321952 he conveniently forgot the atrocities committed by the japanese in their pow camps in the pacific
321953 in territories that werent even theirs like oh say the philippines etc
321954 or the fact that they were committed to the death until two nukes stopped them in their tracks
321955 uh the us marines did go hand to hand with the japanese so yes they did get close enough to do it in a manner of speaking something krappinghisbeard is too chickenshit to do himself
321956 of course no one in japan thinks that so why were the japanese fighting to begin with
321957 because of the socialist commutard roosevelt who happened to be a democrat
321958 or because they wanted to annex china the occupation of nanking comes to mind in addition to australia
321959 after all if japan werent trying to annex the pacific rim and italy the balkans and parts of the middle east and germany the rest of europe and africa why did the japanese sign the tripartrate treaty i guess they were doing their bit for world peace
321960 i heard a chomsky joke the other day i listened to one of his lectures
321961 i read a few chomsky jokes a week ago they went something like this critical lives manufacturing consent miseducation truly ironic considering he is part of the problem as an academic and propaganda and the public mind
321962 meh kb sees everything as an opportunity to bring up again the same handful of topics its shopping here every single time it posts it never has anything else to say its a self fulfilling prophecy

321977 youve got this far sister welcome aboard heres your salary check whoops now youve got to come into work for it
321978 i would hate to find out that detainees were killing each other
321979 the men were ultimately released from u s custody without charge or explanation
321980 plenty of people pay good money for what those freeloaders were getting on our tax dollar
321981 by the way just fyi im not american and have never in fact even been to that country although i would like to visit it some day
321982 we do human rights work re iran we do human rights work re cuba we do human rights work re china and north korea
321983 it makes just makes me sick that europe has in any way benefited from the united states military and their murderous tactics so i can only imagine how europeans feel about it my heart goes out
321984 okay then why dont you condemn north korea or cuba or iran or saudi arabia
321985 in a 121 page report the doctors group said that it uncovered medical evidence of torture including beatings electric shock sleep deprivation sexual humiliation sodomy and scores of other abuses
321986 i think it much more likely that they were injured in some other fashion and are claiming the injuries to be from torture and abuse most members of a military force know better than to abuse prisoners
321987 at yesterdays house judiciary subcommittee on civil rights hearing on torture lawrence wilkerson former chief of staff to colin powell told rep jerrold nadler d ny that over 100 detainees have died in u s custody with up to 27 of these declared homicides
321988 the cnn article stated that they had been released some time ago i dont remember exactly but it was at least a matter of many months
321989 how do you know it wasnt the detainees torturing one another
321990 we do human rights work re iran we do human rights work re cuba we do human rights work re china and north korea
321991 the cnn article stated that they had been released some time ago i dont remember exactly but it was at least a matter of many months
321992 how do we know you really do work on other nations such as iran and cuba
321993 we do not approve of abuse as a society trying to project the blame for acts committed by a few onto an entire society is irrational
321994 everytime it has been proved that one of our own was guilty of taking advantage of prisoners the perpetrators have been punished if you cannot wrap your skulls around these concepts then you are a lost cause
321995 the two star general who led an army investigation into the horrific detainee abuse at abu ghraib has accused the bush administration of war crimes and is calling for accountability
321996 in his 2004 report on abu ghraib then major general anthony taguba concluded that
321997 numerous incidents of sadistic blatant and wanton criminal abuses were inflicted on several detainees
321998 now in a preface to a physicians for human rights report based on medical examinations of former detainees taguba adds an epilogue to his own investigation
321999 the new report he writes tells the largely untold human story of what happened to detainees in our custody when the commander in chief and those under him authorized a systematic regime of torture this story is not only written in words it is scrawled for the rest of these individuals lives on their bodies and minds in order for these individuals to suffer the wanton cruelty to which they were subjected a government policy was promulgated to the field whereby the geneva conventions and the uniform code of military justice were disregarded the un convention against torture was indiscriminately ignored after years of disclosures by government investigations media accounts and reports from human rights organizations there is no longer any doubt as to whether the current administration has committed war crimes the only question that remains to be answered is whether those who ordered the use of torture will be held to account
322000 we have pretty much determined that it smells better around here after all of the liberals have left
322001 i think we all agree that torture and abuse are evil and should not be tolerated
322002 the most extensive medical study of former u s detainees published so far
322003 found evidence of torture and other abuse that resulted in serious injuries and mental disorders
322004 the framework under which detainees were imprisoned for years without charges at guantanamo and in many cases abused in afghanistan wasnt the product of american military policy or the fault of a few rogue soldiers
322005 it was largely the work of five white house pentagon and justice department lawyers who following the orders of president bush and vice president dick cheney reinterpreted or tossed out the u
322006 the supreme court now has struck down many of their legal interpretations it ruled last thursday that preventing detainees from challenging their detention in federal courts was unconstitutional
322007 we see that if even europe with its superior sensibilities cant protect itself with
322008 england and spain welcome our muslim brethren with open arms allah bless em
322009 the spanish caved and voted for the candidate who would get them out of iraq
322010 was i wrong about the attacks being from a terror group
322011 and there were several articles that made the same claim asshole
322012 an appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile hoping it will eat him last
322013 the pp government continued to place partial blame on eta even after evidence that the attacks may have been the work of an islamist group emerged
322014 after 21 months of investigation judge juan del olmo ruled moroccan national jamal zougam guilty of physically carrying out the attack ruling out any eta intervention 31 the september 2007 sentence established no known mastermind nor direct al qaida link 32 33 34 35 36
322015 this spanish retreat will be perceived as a huge political triumph for al qaeda
322016 carry out martyrdom operations in and outside the united states
322017 at the proper time and place until you stop being unjust
322018 hah i knew the jews had to be involved in this somehow
322019 the spanish caved to nothing they voted in anger against a government that lied to them and told them the bombing was by eta whom the same government had already rounded up and put in jail and had bragged about doing the spanish knew it wasnt eta first they were out of operation second it wasnt their mo and took to the streets in protest and their anger came out in the vote against the government read up before you make silly comments its all available online
322020 at yesterdays house judiciary subcommittee on civil rights hearing on torture lawrence wilkerson former chief of staff to colin powell told rep jerrold nadler d ny that over 100 detainees have died in u s custody with up to 27 of these declared homicides

322038 if saddam hussein had been head of iraq and there was no oil under those sands our response to him would not have been as strong as it was in the first gulf war
322039 deals with iraq are set to bring oil giants back
322040 four western companies are in the final stages of negotiations this month on contracts that will return them to iraq 36 years after losing their oil concession to nationalization as saddam hussein rose to power
322041 by 2010 we will need on the order of an additional fifty million barrels a day so where is the oil going to come from while many regions of the world offer great oil opportunities the middle east with two thirds of the worlds oil and the lowest cost is still where the prize ultimately lies
322042 one of the worst decisions in the history of this country
322043 overall i think a year from now we will have made a fair amount of progress if we stay the course
322044 we will win this conflict we will win it easily
322045 im going to be honest i know a lot less about economics than i do about military and foreign policy issues i still need to be educated

322052 remember james watt president reagans first secretary of the interior
322053 my favorite online environmental journal the ever engaging grist reminded us recently of how james watt told the u
322054 look both sides were challenging this question the funny thing of course is that al gore appears to have won florida and so when justice scalia says he brought this trouble upon himself thats not exactly fair since he apparently won the state did not get credit for the state and ultimately lost the presidency over that failure
322055 never travel outside the u s except perhaps to saudi arabia and israel
322056 they were killing me i had to tell them something
322057 continue to pose the most dangerous threat to american lives
322058 my concern is that a movie might endanger the well being of our students
322059 schools are a much more effective bang for the buck than missiles or chasing some taliban around the country
322060 i am convinced that the long term solution to terrorism in general and afghanistan specifically is education
322061 the conflict here will not be won with bombs but with books the thirst for education here is palpable
322062 i think the best comment so far on kbs mental state is well kbs last comment
322063 trying to belittle the source means you have jack schitt to refute the facts
322064 xxxx youre just way out of line supplying the drool squad with all of those facts and evidence logic evidence rationality etc
322065 the lefts attempt to weaken the national defence of the usa
322066 shortly thereafter hiss presided as secretary general over the united nations charter conference in san francisco

322069 amazing the stuff one picks up on ebay isnt it begorrah and i should be careful not to be picking up these americanisms and messing with me good literary hiberno english
322070 in other words nobody has reached any source which has cagetorically denied the 12 the 12 has never been denied is that simple enough for you because im finished with your nitpicking and suggestions that chomsky did anything wrong when patently ic proved nothing of the sort and neither have you

322074 if you were you would be up in arms against real human rights abusers such as iran
322075 hes looking for us democrats lefties nazis jihadists commies baathists terrorists iranians
322076 amnesty international and human rights watch criticized the british government for a report on saddam s use of torture and summary executions the two groups usually welcome such documentation of human rights violations but they criticized the british government for using the report as propaganda to justify an attack on iraq
322077 they are more political and not much on substance they believe that bombing a schools mosques synagogues and markets are a ok but forbid the idea of waterboarding as it may make a person think they are drowning no real permanent harm other than getting wet they would rather see guilty men go free than to actually stop another attack by the way when has amnesty international picketed around a terrorist camp answer never as they know they wouldnt live long enough to protest it existance
322078 ai not getting kidnapped and beheaded because they were too busy kissing ass
322079 in other words nobody has reached any source which has cagetorically denied the 12 the 12 has never been denied

322081 this is just one more sign of the moral degradation of amnesty international

322086 on a satire site where you claim that facts and research are well no more than a joke

322121 i was fairly cranked on pcp and mescaline at the time of writing though so your guess is as good as mine

322123 yes the lack of factuality on this satire site is appalling
322124 the job being to leave a pile of shit behind for a democrat to clean up
322125 and we have so far no proof that anyone has gone through shannon for rendition purposes
322126 despite having no proof at all you chose to believe it happens
322127 oops yes we did bring people through your air space
322128 you even go as far as participate in protests against it
322129 funny because when we prove something to you you chose to not believe a word of it
322130 el baradai the man who received a nobel prize for doing the opposite of what he was paid to do in other words the man who was supposed to stop nuclear proliferation
322131 but instead let north korea and iran get closer than they have ever been to nuclear weapons
322132 how come iran rates a bombing and north korea doesnt
322133 how come iran rates a bombing and north korea doesnt
322134 oops yes we did bring people through your air space
322135 now how will our resident leftist spin this into blaming the usa for it
322136 but the fact remains spains elections were influenced by the bombings
322137 i would love to hear how you id a cia plane
322138 since my source was wikipedia i demand that you go and edit it to show the strength of your conviction that you didnt massacre protestants

322141 chinese authorities in the restive far western region of xinjiang have demolished a mosque for refusing to put up signs in support of this augusts beijing olympics an exiled group said on monday
322142 the cocksure war supporters learned this humbling lesson during the dark days of 2006 and now the cocksure surge opponents drunk on their own vindication will get to enjoy their season of humility they have already gone through the stages of intellectual denial first they simply disbelieved that the surge and the petraeus strategy was doing any good then they accused people who noticed progress in iraq of duplicity and derangement then they acknowledged military but not political progress lately they have skipped over to the argument that iraq is progressing so well that the u s forces can quickly come home
322143 just because the eta was blamed and it was found not to be so the signs of appeasement were there before and after the election spain caved period
322144 the new york times admits the surge in irak is working
322145 just because the eta was blamed and it was found not to be so the signs of appeasement were there before and after the election spain caved period
322146 the leftist rabble in the street werent bitchin about eta that cover story didnt evolve until much later
322147 one of socialist zapateros first acts as leader was to pull spanish troops from iraq the very definition of cave
322148 he had said for months that if he got into power he was withdrawing troops
322149 he did not withdraw them as a result of the bombing
322150 the new york times admits the surge in irak is working
322151 a group with the regal sounding name of the presidential memorial commission of san francisco is planning to ask voters here to change the name of a prize winning water treatment plant on the shoreline to the george w
322152 and regardless of the measures outcome supporters plan to commemorate the inaugural with a synchronized flush of hundreds of thousands of san francisco toilets an action that would send a flood of water toward the plant now called the oceanside water pollution control plant
322153 so now our feeble minded leftist resident claims a new york times piece is not realy a new york times piece
322154 the new york times admits the surge in irak is working
322155 as if you know more about what has happened in north america than we north americans do
322156 now that we have provided evidence that shows he is wrong and we are right
322157 now let me point out exactly what an op ed piece does
322158 this particular piece is helping to rebuild the nyts image as a fair and balanced form of news media
322159 the subject matter carries enough weight for the nyt to give it some room on the editorial page
322160 let me also add that since the new york times has been accused of bias slanted reporting outright lies and have been caught
322161 i can criticize because i detest the times editorial policy of anti war when it does not provide the whole story
322162 et rappelez vous d fense de lire et surtout d fense dapprendre au revoir mes petits enfants
322163 americans can attempt to re write history to their hearts content europeans know the truth and watched the events live for three days with a hell of a lot more background knowledge than americans

322165 the government had insisted that its prime suspect in thursdays rail bombings was the armed basque separatist group eta even as evidence mounted of an islamic link in the bombings
322166 the government was accused of withholding information on the investigation to save the election
322167 before the iraq war brooks argued forcefully on moral grounds for american military intervention echoing the belief of neoconservative commentators and political figures that american and british forces would be welcomed as liberators
322168 in april 2004 sasha issenberg of philadelphia magazine set out to retrace the journey through franklin county pennsylvania that brooks described in the article
322169 on my journeys to franklin county i set a goal i was going to spend 20 on a restaurant meal id scan the menu and realize that id been beaten once again i went through great vats of chipped beef and seafood delight trying to drop 20 i waded through enough surf and turfs and enough creamed corn to last a lifetime i could not do it
322170 i lunched at the chambersburg red lobster and quickly realized that he could not have waded through much surf and turf at all the steak and lobster combination with grilled center cut new york strip is the most expensive thing on the menu it costs 28 75
322171 problem is he doesnt seem like a guy who can go into an applebees salad bar and people think he fits in naturally there
322172 shortly after the attacks islamic militants claimed responsibility on behalf of al qaeda and said they acted to avenge the presence of spanish troops dispatched to iraq in 2003 by then prime minister jose maria aznar
322173 however a senior spanish intelligence official and a western one closely involved in counterterrorism measures told the associated press last month there was no evidence the cell had any contact with or received any logistical or financial help from osama bin ladens terrorist network
322174 aznars government blamed basque separatists for the attacks even after evidence of an islamic link emerged voters punished his party at the polls in elections three days after the bombings
322175 cricket since our resident leftists can not deny the surge is working they chose to divert attention away from this fact to other unimportant stuff
322176 you dont know me from adam mega asshole and you know even less about my politics
322177 the government had insisted that its prime suspect in thursdays rail bombings was the armed basque separatist group eta even as evidence mounted of an islamic link in the bombings

322206 critics of the npt recognized nuclear weapon states sometimes argue that what they view as the failure of the npt recognized nuclear weapon states to disarm themselves of nuclear weapons especially in the post cold war era has angered some non nuclear weapon npt signatories of the npt such failure these critics add provides justification for the non nuclear weapon signatories to quit the npt and develop their own nuclear arsenals
322207 why are you here on a satire site you hate
322208 why did you ban janny and then lie about it
322209 have you found that quote where i supposedly called your art discussion propaganda
322210 last weekend iran signaled that it would not comply with united nations security council resolutions requiring it to stop enriching uranium during his european visit mr bush won pledges from some european leaders to tighten sanctions against iran but irans foreign minister manouchehr mottaki said his country was prepared to open comprehensive negotiations with the european unions foreign policy chief javier solana and the six world powers the united states britain france germany russia and china that have proposed a set of incentives to resolve the impasse over irans nuclear program
322211 i have no intention of wasting my time with someone who knows so little of irish history that hes prepared to write
322212 nope not even close to the un doc i take it the doctor is male but i could be wrong
322213 id like to apologize to any and all that ive hurt
322214 the state has not proved this gentleman is involved in a crime
322215 he has a tape but has not presented this tape all he is doing is presenting hearsay so we would ask the court to find there is no probable cause to hold him over for this
322216 allegedly there was a knock at the door a young child answers they told roger it was for him
322217 he exits the house a few moments later they hear a loud bang he comes back into the house with a handgun in his hand and runs out the back
322218 i dont even know what to say on pats behalf because its traumatizing
322219 i dont know why this happened to someone like pat he said because someone was going to punk him out like that and not give him his 12 and thats the reason he was mad
322220 i dont know what happened to roger i guess he snapped i have nothing for him now i used to think he was a good guy but not anymore

322225 und ich werde immer auf meinen zweiten vornamen angesprochen rgert doch mathis der ist es doch gleich mehrmals
322226 you f cking piece of sh t youre a f cking moron
322227 one of the most offensive sites ive seen in blogtopia
322228 its like asking a crack addict to read war and peace starting at the back while standing on their heads
322229 or even reverent wright for that matter or which i have yet to see hear or read a single line which would indicate such
322230 kb you pretty much have written yourself off as anyone that can be remotely seriously
322231 i mean what could possible marxist wright have said that was so disparaginjg of his country
322232 and i dont mean in the playful sense im sure he actually believe daily kos is well balanced and keith olberman is the second coming of murrow and so on and so forth
322233 in otherwords what have i said to you people here ignore this sick sick man do not ingage with trolls
322234 when this drooling foolish no nothing fool interrupts are otherwise salient and enjoyable putdowns of various liberal stupidies
322235 god damn you to hell for everything you have ever done and for everything that you are
322236 please explain to me in 100 words or less how the above exclamation in any way shape or form indicates anything but the most passionate love for you and your character
322237 if a certain black messiah candidate for president who will go unnamed asks for
322238 you need to read up on internet trolls because calling attention to someones writing mistakes in lieu of addressing their argument is a typical troll tactic

322240 anti american into the discussion and then demanded that everyone else argue against it
322241 rather than define the term by its substance a better way to proceed is to think of anti americanism as a way of thinking about the united states that a refuses to be deterred in its judgement by doubt or the acknowledgement of complexity and b subscribes to what brian fawcett in his reflections on noam chomsky calls a standard total view stv of the united states as a demonic purveyor of more or less total evil 1991 p 175 in other words no matter what aspect of the united states or its foreign policy is under discussion you know you are in the presence of an anti american when you detect the dogmatic standard total view dstv in operation thus mere opposition to american policies and attitudes is not sufficient to constitute anti americanism moreover anti americanism can be motivated by completely opposed points of view for example dislike of america because it is overly religious or because it is overly secular in short anti americanism is a disposition rather than a substantive set of beliefs or arguments
322242 no evidence of any kind that remotely resembles the remotest resemblance of what has that got to do with anything that i have ever said anywhere
322243 god damn noam chomsky dont get me wrong i love chomsky but i despise everything he stands for his political positions his values his writing style his followers et cetera
322244 why i know my husband is an alcoholic but whatever you do dont call him one
322245 never mind that it was you who brought the term
322246 rather than define the term by its substance a better way to proceed is to think of anti americanism as a way of thinking about the united states
322247 that a refuses to be deterred in its judgement by doubt or the acknowledgement of complexity
322248 and b subscribes to what brian fawcett in his reflections on noam chomsky calls a standard total view stv of the united states as a demonic purveyor of more or less total evil 1991 p 175
322249 in other words no matter what aspect of the united states or its foreign policy is under discussion you know you are in the presence of an anti american when you detect the dogmatic standard total view dstv in operation
322250 thus mere opposition to american policies and attitudes is not sufficient to constitute anti americanism
322251 moreover anti americanism can be motivated by completely opposed points of view for example dislike of america because it is overly religious or because it is overly secular in short anti americanism is a disposition rather than a substantive set of beliefs or arguments
322252 anti american into the discussion and then demanded that everyone else argue against it
322253 the nations most implacable critic of u s foreign policy
322254 argues that the war is unjust america is the biggest terrorist state and intellectuals always support official violence
322255 the terrorist attacks were major atrocities in scale they may not reach the level of many others for example the bombing of the sudan with no credible pretext destroying half its pharmaceutical supplies and killing unknown numbers of people no one knows because the u s blocked an inquiry at the u n and no one cares to pursue it
322256 thats not going to stop me using it to bust your ugly chops though
322257 cowen rued the fact that the government found itself on the defensive because libertas and other groups opposed to the treaty successfully played on peoples fears it would mean a loss of national sovereignty
322258 i like being part of europe but i dont want europe to take away any more of our irishness
322259 thats not going to stop me using it to bust your ugly chops though
322260 the inspiring shows of patriotism the american left display to france
322261 sounds ireland wants to either tighten up on immigrations which being a member of the eu wouldnt really exist anyway right
322262 or retain some sort of uniqueness which doesnt fit too well with your olde world odor
322263 its simply missing something similar to missing a turn when driving
322264 yep id classify that as pretty stupid too seems we set our stupid bars at fairly different heights why am i not surprised by that
322265 so none of what i posted above remotely fits in any way with the definition of anti americanism i pulled off google
322266 is he unaware that it is quite impossible to be patriotic to a country that is not ones own
322267 and the majority of them got into the field because they were dysfunctional children themselves
322268 you know i can actually see you in my minds eye drafting the passive aggressive letter youd be writing to my parents if i was one of your students
322269 this is real patriotism as defined by our lord and saviour the black hay soos obama
322270 senator obama stated to the associated press that he no longer wears a flag lapel pin because people started using it as an empty symbol of patriotism instead of actually being a patriot i couldnt agree with him more the same people that claim to love america and wear a flag lapel pin on their chests are nothing more than politicians wanting to secure their election while sending over 4 000 american troops to their deaths in a war that was started with lies
322271 nbc anchor brian williams on monday evening rued that afghanistan
322272 in the month of may for the first time ever american and allied combat deaths were higher in afghanistan than the monthly loss in iraq
322273 did i ever say that america didnt like being unique you bitched about it enough so when ireland dumps on the eu like that with reasons like those you are aping america
322274 wow im so totally irrelevant i seem to have successfully given xxxxliberal an aneurysm
322275 you are so uniquely qualified to write about american affairs based on your conversations with americans and newscasts even though you have never been here and have never lived here
322276 it was a reason the voters in ireland refused the treaty
322277 and what in the name of shit has that got to do with an australian claiming to be
322278 as an australian im sure to have some irish ancestry somewhere along the line by virtue of which i surely must be supremely competent to commentate on americas role in world affairs even though im not amerikkkan and have never been there 1 11
322279 i will give you my quotes and sources for the psych research when you post that quote of me saying your art discussion was propaganda
322280 and spare me the shite about how everything on the web isnt reliable because if you say that web research isnt reliable
322281 then you have to remove yourself from this blog for that would not only make you dishonest it would expose you again for the claptrap hypocrite you are
322282 why on gaias planet would a bunch of socialist wannabes like the irish
322283 you dont want to lose freedoms and rights which you wouldnt have if you bound yourself to that treaty
322284 well maybe that is why i dont like hillary or hussein obama both of them want to take my sovereignty
322285 hm now i need convincing that you werent dropped on your head
322286 i will give you my quotes and sources for the psych research when you post that quote of me saying your art discussion was propaganda
322287 quote the salient put downs of liberal stupidities that devon made that or shut it
322288 fuck off you post your direct quotes of me calling your art discussion propaganda or shut it
322289 so none of what i posted above remotely fits in any way with the definition of anti americanism i pulled off google
322290 you have ics problem a very big head with a very small brain inside
322291 re heally i believe ive posted here before that i have a solid iq of 140 and im still waiting for you to give a comparitive figure to back up your numerous contentions that im a drooler in comparison to you
322292 what in the name of christ rubbish are you posting
322293 most of us lefties who arrived here from what is archaically known as
322294 the standard lefty cop out that they hate us foreign policy stikes me as a fig leaf for their general hatred and jealousy of the usa
322295 no dicktard you made the assumption that i said your art discussions with mc were propaganda
322296 now as to reading irish newspapers i read enough to know there is widespread discontent with your labour party not only with the corruption of the ahern regime and with the lack of delivery on the promises labour has made to the people
322297 i am not going to answer you jack diddly squat until you put up that quote you attributed to me either you do it or you leave
322298 no lunatic they werent youre a naive child you are convinced that people are whatever their party name says they are you need to start judging regimes by their actions
322299 its not a cop out and you choose to believe that because it suits you but youre wrong and dont even pretend to know what goes on inside our heads
322300 we now see that rev wrights claims that the u s government introduced aids to conduct a genocide against black people are in fact a reasoned and balanced critique of shortcomings in healthcare legislation
322301 sounds nothing remotely similar to tm the definition of anti americanism i posted above
322302 noam chomsky and susan sontag will always be remembered as the two leading american intellectuals who said the wrong thing after sept 11
322303 for sontag it was her now infamous new yorker magazine slap at the idea that the terrorists were cowards
322304 to many it seemed chomsky was shrugging off the sept 11 attacks on the united states because our country commits atrocities just as terrible and often worse
322305 what brought the u s to the battered region of yugoslavia chomsky wrote was not a humanitarian drive to stop slobodan milosevic from ethnically cleansing yet another muslim population but in fact the interests of our foreign policy elite his critics argue that this is typical the chomsky position reflexively brands american foreign intervention as self interested or imperialistic regardless of what else might be at stake
322306 but chomskys remarks after sept 11 struck many as beyond the pale even those accustomed to his relentless style of dissent
322307 i suggest that faucett or whoever learn to read and understand words before making up fairy tales and to pass them off as fact
322308 i will give you my quotes and sources for the psych research when you post that quote of me saying your art discussion was propaganda
322309 quote the salient put downs of liberal stupidities that devon made that or shut it
322310 fuck off you post your direct quotes of me calling your art discussion propaganda or shut it
322311 we now see that rev wrights claims that the u s government introduced aids to conduct a genocide against black people are in fact a reasoned and balanced critique of shortcomings in healthcare legislation

322315 to many it seemed chomsky was shrugging off the sept 11 attacks on the united states because our country commits atrocities just as terrible and often worse
322316 what brought the u s to the battered region of yugoslavia chomsky wrote was not a humanitarian drive to stop slobodan milosevic from ethnically cleansing yet another muslim population but in fact the interests of our foreign policy elite or more accurately the clintons his critics argue that this is typical the chomsky position reflexively brands american foreign intervention as self interested or imperialistic regardless of what else might be at stake
322317 but chomskys remarks after sept 11 struck many as beyond the pale even those accustomed to his relentless style of dissent
322318 i suggest that faucett or whoever learn to read and understand words before making up fairy tales and to pass them off as fact
322319 ive said it before and ill say it again bwahahahahahahahahaha
322320 im curious what the nazis ever did which lefty mouth breathers consider right wing
322321 but youre wrong and dont even pretend to know what goes on inside our heads
322322 once again filthes argument is to simply insist that something is so without a shred of proof
322323 im curious what the nazis ever did which lefty mouth breathers consider right wing
322324 hitlers germany was no different that stalins russia with the ss and the gestapo
322325 since you post rubbish that raises eyebrows across several continents
322326 to ease concerns among potential right wing nationalist supporters drexler made clear that unlike marxists the party supported middle class citizens and that the partys socialist policy was meant to give social welfare to german citizens deemed part of the aryan race
322327 although the partys 1925 program made some rhetorical concessions to the socialist element this was never central to the partys policies
322328 whoever wrote filthes little article about the nsdap on wiki tried their hardest to suggest that the nsdap were not lefties
322329 left to their own devices bush and cheney would have you living under a totalitarian regime a police state a dictatorship
322330 but youre wrong and dont even pretend to know what goes on inside our heads
322331 whoever wrote filthes little article about the nsdap on wiki tried their hardest to suggest that the nsdap were not lefties
322332 we are socialists we are enemies of todays capitalistic economic system for the exploitation of the economically weak with its unfair salaries with its unseemly evaluation of a human being according to wealth and property instead of responsibility and performance and we are all determined to destroy this system under all conditions
322333 most cruel joke of all however has been played by hitler amp co on those german capitalists and small businessmen who once backed national socialism as a means of saving germanys bourgeois economic structure from radicalism the nazi credo that the individual belongs to the state also applies to business some businesses have been confiscated outright on other what amounts to a capital tax has been levied profits have been strictly controlled some idea of the increasing governmental control and interference in business could be deduced from the fact that 80 of all building and 50 of all industrial orders in germany originated last year with the government hard pressed for food stuffs as well as funds the nazi regime has taken over large estates and in many instances collectivized agriculture a procedure fundamentally similar to russian communism
322334 on the theory of the centrally administered economy an analysis of the german experiment
322335 somehow our educational system fails to remind them that the collectivist advocate herbert matthews a new york times writer who was instrumental in bringing castro to power in cuba claimed that he was
322336 shirer as a liberal journalist doesnt want to fully acknowledge the socialism of national socialism

322339 and the nazis were in fact uber socialists who believed in the state above all just like how modern
322340 capitalist libertarians as opposed to the ridiculous oxymoron that is
322341 so you were looking for a cd while you were replying to my post
322342 and if you were driving and you missed the turnoff to johnson drive by the way freudian slip much
322343 you better believe id bitchslap you in the mouth for making us take the long way around
322344 now that you cant tell the difference or that you set the bar at a difference height is more certainly correct though id probably go one step further and say that in order to even know how or where for that matter to set the bar at all youd have to know what the bar was as already demonstrated you dont boring
322345 i must confess that the concept of an australian who doesnt know what a bar is is beyond me
322346 well first of all i would think that the notion of the government introduced aids would be giving the government far too much credit for being able to pull off some of its antics
322347 uh huh but you dont hate america though youre just opposed to inequities in health care
322348 that there are shortcomings in the healthcare system of the richest country in the world isnt really a matter debate unless you wish to debate how to deal with the problem
322349 i have not the slightest interest in debating how to deal with the problem
322350 getting back to the topic at hand which as you may recall was not american healthcare do you have a better explanation for why rev wright said the government created aids to conduct a genocide on black people
322351 assuming that you allow for the possibility that there are some people who hold anti american sentiment
322352 that means chomsky criticizes american foreign policy more than even the most diehard anti american
322353 because if calling america the biggest terrorist state isnt anti americanism
322354 then by your logic youd have to be opposed to al qaeda for some other reason than terrorism
322355 were going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good
322356 capitalist libertarians as opposed to the ridiculous oxymoron that is

322369 because if calling america the biggest terrorist state isnt anti americanism
322370 then by your logic youd have to be opposed to al qaeda for some other reason than terrorism
322371 i mean perhaps rather than reading a few phrases from other drooling anti chomskyites who also dont know what theyre talking about you should demonstrate that you have at least a little gray matter and read for yourself
322372 firstly by your definition the fact that people oppose what chomsky says and does doesnt make them anti chomskyites
322373 and secondly when i was reading their droolings was i not reading for myself
322374 perhaps even ask a few intelligent questions like why would he make such a charge
322375 did he have evidence to support the contention that 12 of israels air force are based in turkey
322376 do you think he doesnt or hasnt been presenting evidence for the past 50 years showing this all over the place
322377 to be perfectly honest i try to spend as little of my time as is possible thinking about what hes been doing
322378 firstly by your definition the fact that people oppose what chomsky says and does doesnt make them anti chomskyites
322379 and secondly when i was reading their droolings was i not reading for myself
322380 perhaps even ask a few intelligent questions like why would he make such a charge
322381 did he have evidence to support the contention that 12 of israels air force are based in turkey
322382 id have to conclude hes not intellectual and therefore unworthy of my time
322383 do you think he doesnt or hasnt been presenting evidence for the past 50 years showing this all over the place
322384 to be perfectly honest i try to spend as little of my time as is possible thinking about what hes been doing
322385 the original source that chomsky cited backed away from the number and said it wasnt accurate but you still maintain chomsky was accurate when he used it
322386 i do believe i posted my iq earlier in the thread
322387 so it posted about two dozen requests for me to edit filthes own source wiki
322388 which you ran from like a scalded cat very impressive jokey
322389 the body of political and economic doctrines held and put into effect by the nazis including the totalitarian principle of government state control of all industry predominance of groups assumed to be racially superior and supremacy of the f hrer
322390 any of various economic and political theories advocating collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods
322391 by which you mean that to have read one of chomskys books is to have read them all or do you just have poor syntax
322392 youre just wallowing in the ignorance of just another uninformed pseudo patriotic drooler who hears and sees what he wants
322393 i take it youre saying here that you see and hear what you dont want no wonder youre so cranky then
322394 ive read a couple of his articles on a political forum i used to post on mostly quoted in support of arguments about why the jooooooooohs are eeeeeeviiiiillll
322395 iirc he claimed the shin bet had reported the separation barrier having no effect on terrorist attacks then checking the shin bet report myself to find it said the exact opposite although im not entirely sure that was chomsky
322396 sounds nothing remotely similar to tm the definition of anti americanism i posted above
322397 theres nothing anti american in anything which has been presented here so far nor have you demonstrated there to be
322398 im going to use the same logic in the next argument i have with my lyfe partner
322399 im certain s he will soon come around to your way of thinking 1
322400 honey i only took your pictures out of my wallet and burned them all because i disagree with your policies like making me take out the trash
322401 its not because i remotely tm have the remotest feeling of dislike for you
322402 its ironic how well that one sentence sums up your entire post
322403 may as well say that big foot is over there and choose to believe it while not providing any evidence
322404 its going to be funny as shit when he bites your legs off
322405 i found the little that i did read excrutiatingly boring and extremely contrived
322406 nothing remotely masochistic about educating yourself to many basic facts about your own society
322407 okay but we better settle on a safe word before we start
322408 by which you mean that to have read one of chomskys books is to have read them all or do you just have poor syntax
322409 youre just wallowing in the ignorance of just another uninformed pseudo patriotic drooler who hears and sees what he wants
322410 i take it youre saying here that you see and hear what you dont want no wonder youre so cranky then

322420 may as well say that big foot is over there and choose to believe it while not providing any evidence
322421 its going to be funny as shit when he bites your legs off
322422 why would you say this youve read his work too and come this conclusion thats odd nothing i read struck me as the least bit painful
322423 i found the little that i did read excrutiatingly boring and extremely contrived
322424 nothing remotely masochistic about educating yourself to many basic facts about your own society
322425 okay but we better settle on a safe word before we start
322426 the original source that chomsky cited backed away from the number and said it wasnt accurate but you still maintain chomsky was accurate when he used it
322427 i do believe i posted my iq earlier in the thread
322428 as intelligence of a person increases the number of those whom he or she considers peers tends to decrease for example at an iq of 135 on the wechsler scale only every hundredth person would be of equal or greater iq this number shrinks significantly as iq goes up
322429 so it posted about two dozen requests for me to edit filthes own source wiki
322430 actually i was going to say i was going to try and play semantics myself luckily for all of us you headed me off at the pass just in time to save spring break
322431 firstly by your definition the fact that people oppose what chomsky says and does doesnt make them anti chomskyites
322432 no the people who call themselves anti chomsky are anti chomsky
322433 nah ill just wait until you can explain to me why your hero made up a speech by pres truman
322434 and secondly when i was reading their droolings was i not reading for myself
322435 i said hes contrived and he bores the shiite out of me
322436 if you cant remember what you wrote then bite me
322437 perhaps even ask a few intelligent questions like why would he make such a charge
322438 over mothered possibly physically underdeveloped and bad at sports fails at life in every area except for criticizing those who achieve far more than he could ever dream of
322439 and thinks he has some greater wisdom that must be shared with everyone else
322440 no the people who call themselves anti chomsky are anti chomsky
322441 nah ill just wait until you can explain to me why your hero made up a speech by pres truman
322442 and secondly when i was reading their droolings was i not reading for myself
322443 uhh yes you were reading their droolings this has nothing to do with you knowing chomskys work on the contrary for the most part this has probably prevented you from understanding his work
322444 i said hes contrived and he bores the shiite out of me
322445 if you cant remember what you wrote then bite me
322446 perhaps even ask a few intelligent questions like why would he make such a charge
322447 over mothered possibly physically underdeveloped and bad at sports fails at life in every area except for criticizing those who achieve far more than he could ever dream of
322448 and thinks he has some greater wisdom that must be shared with everyone else
322449 no the people who call themselves anti chomsky are anti chomsky
322450 nah ill just wait until you can explain to me why your hero made up a speech by pres truman
322451 and secondly when i was reading their droolings was i not reading for myself
322452 uhh yes you were reading their droolings this has nothing to do with you knowing chomskys work on the contrary for the most part this has probably prevented you from understanding his work
322453 i said hes contrived and he bores the shiite out of me
322454 if you cant remember what you wrote then bite me
322455 perhaps even ask a few intelligent questions like why would he make such a charge
322456 over mothered possibly physically underdeveloped and bad at sports fails at life in every area except for criticizing those who achieve far more than he could ever dream of
322457 and thinks he has some greater wisdom that must be shared with everyone else
322458 chomsky quoted a secondary source who repeated a fact that he thought wasnt accurate
322459 phew i was afraid chomskys credibility might come into question for a moment there lucky you set me straight
322460 get your facts straight if youre going to attempt to dispute something
322461 totally irrelevant even if we were to accept your word on it
322462 sarcasm and smart remarks on a satire site how hideous 11
322463 as intelligence of a person increases the number of those whom he or she considers peers tends to decrease for example at an iq of 135 on the wechsler scale only every hundredth person would be of equal or greater iq this number shrinks significantly as iq goes up
322464 id post mine but then jokeyjoe or some other clown would ask for proof just as he wanted proof of what goes on in my head
322465 but you avoid posting examples the smart alec strikes again wooo
322466 since the discussion was on blamebush not wikipedia why would joe have to edit wikipedia in order to prove his point
322467 claiming that criticism stems from lack of understanding is pretty intellectually lazy
322468 you also appear to have trouble spotting links that i post and spelling words correctly and structuring sentences properly
322469 calling attention to someones writing mistakes in lieu of addressing their argument is a typical troll tactic
322470 ive been advising droolers to do this for years and as would be expected theyve all been cowards
322471 like ic who e mailed chumpskys source to check on the accuracy of his
322472 now one can only be qualified to criticize chumpsky if they have spoken to him directly
322473 only if you promise to teach me to spell like you afterwards since you appear to have declared hunting season on the english language id like to join in the fun
322474 that is one of the longest run on sentences i have ever seen
322475 nothing remotely masochistic about educating yourself to many basic facts about your own society
322476 like i already did three times in this thread using no more resources than the comments from a couple of posters that i dont even know personally
322477 because its a conservative satire site why are you here
322478 and you havent succeeded at spelling properly or putting together decent sentences here
322479 or in defending chomsky against any of the criticisms leveled at him
322480 all youve done is call people droolers tell them to read chomskys books
322481 and said that if they dont agree with him its because they dont understand him
322482 did he have evidence to support the contention that 12 of israels air force are based in turkey
322483 i read the entire e mail exchange with ic and whoever chomskys source was
322484 the source was asked whether he believes 12 is an accurate figure and he said probably not
322485 except for when the source of the quote said it was probably inaccurate apart from that everything was a okay
322486 nope because the source of the evidence said it wasnt
322487 chomsky quoted a secondary source who repeated a fact that he thought wasnt accurate
322488 phew i was afraid chomskys credibility might come into question for a moment there lucky you set me straight
322489 get your facts straight if youre going to attempt to dispute something
322490 totally irrelevant even if we were to accept your word on it
322491 sarcasm and smart remarks on a satire site how hideous 11
322492 as intelligence of a person increases the number of those whom he or she considers peers tends to decrease for example at an iq of 135 on the wechsler scale only every hundredth person would be of equal or greater iq this number shrinks significantly as iq goes up
322493 id post mine but then jokeyjoe or some other clown would ask for proof just as he wanted proof of what goes on in my head
322494 but you avoid posting examples the smart alec strikes again wooo
322495 since the discussion was on blamebush not wikipedia why would joe have to edit wikipedia in order to prove his point
322496 claiming that criticism stems from lack of understanding is pretty intellectually lazy
322497 you also appear to have trouble spotting links that i post and spelling words correctly and structuring sentences properly
322498 calling attention to someones writing mistakes in lieu of addressing their argument is a typical troll tactic
322499 ive been advising droolers to do this for years and as would be expected theyve all been cowards
322500 like ic who e mailed chumpskys source to check on the accuracy of his
322501 now one can only be qualified to criticize chumpsky if they have spoken to him directly
322502 only if you promise to teach me to spell like you afterwards since you appear to have declared hunting season on the english language id like to join in the fun
322503 that is one of the longest run on sentences i have ever seen
322504 nothing remotely masochistic about educating yourself to many basic facts about your own society
322505 like i already did three times in this thread using no more resources than the comments from a couple of posters that i dont even know personally
322506 because its a conservative satire site why are you here
322507 the original source that chomsky cited backed away from the number and said it wasnt accurate but you still maintain chomsky was accurate when he used it
322508 and then you tell me its me whos indoctrinated here er well i got nothing really in response to that speaks for itself really
322509 yes this is probably more the sort of response you should stick with as you are not going to win any sort of intelligent debate
322510 i do believe i posted my iq earlier in the thread
322511 but since your only prerequisite for admittance into the community of the cognicenti appears to be agreeing with chomsky i guess that doesnt mean much to you
322512 now which of his books did you say you had read
322513 if chomsky were to write fiction that was as interesting as twains i would read that with great appreciation
322514 he doesnt however as in he does write fiction but its not interesting
322515 he opposes all violence if hes rational except for perhaps self defense or fighting against oppression of some sort
322516 id have to conclude hes not intellectual and therefore unworthy of my time
322517 youre not intelligent enough to conclude anything about his intelligence because you know nothing about him
322518 i was simply using his own statement to make the judgement
322519 but that youre pretending to demonstrates not only your dishonesty which was very apparent early on but that you are sort of lacking upstairs
322520 it may be possible to repair but it will take a lot of work a lot of study and a change of attitude
322521 you dont know what is and whats not worthy of your time you poor thing
322522 perhaps rubbing and ann coulter book cover on your little wood would satisfy your time
322523 itd do a lot more for me than rubbing up on a chomsky book would
322524 do you think he doesnt or hasnt been presenting evidence for the past 50 years showing this all over the place
322525 to be perfectly honest i try to spend as little of my time as is possible thinking about what hes been doing
322526 and yet three separate posters on this blog have challenged three different points chomsky made and you havent managed to defend any of them
322527 1 ic checked with chomskys source on the iaf in turkey the source said the number was probably inaccurate
322528 3 i posted a speech from pres truman that chomsky completely misquoted
322529 so far you appear to be down three nil whaddaryergonna do about it
322530 1 ic checked with chomskys source on the iaf in turkey the source said the number was probably inaccurate
322531 by which you mean that to have read one of chomskys books is to have read them all or do you just have poor syntax
322532 er i know i was being facetious in order to highlight your inability to structure a sentence properly despite your high handed claims of intellectualism
322533 claiming that criticism stems from lack of understanding is pretty intellectually lazy
322534 but in all fairness to you you would have to know what his work consisted of before understanding it
322535 still not able to defend the truman speech gaffe then
322536 youre just wallowing in the ignorance of just another uninformed pseudo patriotic drooler who hears and sees what he wants
322537 i take it youre saying here that you see and hear what you dont want
322538 you seem to have trouble addressing the fake speech by pres truman which i presume is a concious action on your part
322539 you also appear to have trouble spotting links that i post
322540 and spelling words correctly and structuring sentences properly maybe you should get your vision checked
322541 but if you have the evidence id be happy to look at it
322542 its probably a good idea to not talking about the subject unless youre some sort of masochist who likes being made to look the idiot in public
322543 masochism appears to be the best explanation for your fawning love of chomsky in the face of glaring factual errors in so much of his work
322544 and until you understand how to read and learn what sentences mean chomsky should probably be way down on your list
322545 ive read a couple of his articles on a political forum i used to post on mostly quoted in support of arguments about why the jooooooooohs are eeeeeeviiiiillll
322546 bull chomsky didnt confirm the number that the source said was exaggerated if chomsky is going to have credibility he damn well better check his sources and their numbers if he has no way of confirming it then it is groos negligence to report something that isnt accurate an academic of chomskys vaunted reputation and standing should know that is the first order of business verify three times
322547 but youre not a new arrival either since youre quoting a debate about the iaf in turkey and seem to be somewhat au fait with it so you were reading in secret and only started posting lately either that or youre a sockpuppet for che
322548 either that or i read the archives you wouldnt make much of a detective mate
322549 you sound a lot like my neighbours cat when i ran over its tail with the lawnmower
322550 its that taxing to check whether i spell words with our instead of or
322551 there is no evidence that he thought it was inaccurate at the time he used it
322552 you would propose that he post them in what format
322553 engage being a transitive verb as defined by the preposition
322554 i think i can safely assume that a you believe the figure i posted and b your own figure is lower
322555 of you getting nailed its a mental picture id rather not remind myself of
322556 he posted articles from reputable sources right here the discussion was here not on wikipedia
322557 perhaps that would explain kbs insistence on insulting my intelligence and literacy which if youd been reading along youd know occurred before i posted that
322558 like ic who e mailed chumpskys source to check on the accuracy of his
322559 i see so ic is a coward for making known his true identity on an internet site but you who refuse to do so are not a coward
322560 now one can only be qualified to criticize chumpsky if they have spoken to him directly
322561 that is not what he said but he did suggest it might be a good idea to read him first
322562 kb specifically told me to write to chomsky and ask him why he quoted a certain
322563 now one can only be qualified to criticize chumpsky if they have spoken to him directly
322564 run on sentences are not noted as an outstanding testament to literacy
322565 sigh the point was that my society is not america
322566 both are equally ridiculous excuses that you pulled out of your sses
322567 youre right chomsky quoted a secondary source who repeated a fact that he thought wasnt accurate
322568 phew i was afraid chomskys credibility might come into question for a moment there lucky you set me straight
322569 and he did not say it wasnt accurate he suggested that it might be exaggerated
322570 get your facts straight if youre going to attempt to dispute something
322571 krappinghisbear the master de bater who loves to call people droolers
322572 but says it is all right for megatwat to have never read chomsky
322573 because she it hym other agrees with the little sod based on krappinghisbeards rambling farts then megatwat is just too smoochy ass kissing smart for the rest of us
322574 but if one hasnt read chomsky and disagrees with him
322575 then the wrate of a thousand gnats is buzzing forth furiously angry because one disagrees with chomsky based on what others have said about him
322576 now about che if he said he is reading or has read it then he has
322577 but because krappinghisbeard couldnt restrain himself anymore che wont respond
322578 then kb started flapping his gums and broke the agreement
322579 so che took it off the blog and talked with people here via email
322580 bad no no kb isnt there to make sure people arent getting brainwashed
322581 that no one can really understand chomsky unless they have a tour guide
322582 well that is reason enough right there to detest him and everything he ever wrote if kb is the cheerleader and the brass band
322583 as to intent to deceive not confirming a sources claims pretty much sums it up because the source is saying what wants to be heard not the truth
322584 1 ic checked with chomskys source on the iaf in turkey the source said the number was probably inaccurate
322585 bull chomsky didnt confirm the number that the source said was exaggerated
322586 if chomsky is going to have credibility he damn well better check his sources and their numbers
322587 if he has no way of confirming it then it is groos negligence to report something that isnt accurate
322588 an academic of chomskys vaunted reputation and standing should know that is the first order of business verify three times
322589 kb is this a particular trait of the right in the usa
322590 claiming every two minutes to have handed people their asses or wiped the floor with people when there isnt any evidence either there or quoted for it
322591 doesnt happen this side of the pond in our experience
322592 uh where did i ask you to call me a drooler dicktard
322593 kb and everyone else on the planet who is rational please call me a drooler
322594 show me the exact quote missouri boy otherwise shut your pie hole
322595 well if the fact was so irrelevant it became so after ic slammed your beloved noam on it
322596 then why did you make it a point of contention
322597 you see you argue like this when you have had y our nose rubbed in it
322598 once you get your butts whupped the points you decide to argue about become irrelevant
322599 dont know what youre referring to is about all you can come up with so there is a perfect example of your ignorance and denial
322600 omfo bama i so cannot be bothered reading kbs giant spiel of crap
322601 so would you asshat so would you werent you making all those comments about wrapping up the threads as your last statement projecting are you
322602 now have you finished your assignment on totalitarian governments and your claim they are not left leaning or socialist
322603 droolers do it as a matter of principle because they believe it demonstrates their manliness
322604 in all fairness to this site its the first one from the right where i havent been banned as i recall
322605 omfo bama i so cannot be bothered reading kbs giant spiel of crap
322606 i mean these places are the antithesis of good democratic socialist governments other than perhaps using some of the lefts lingo
322607 iow just because you say it is doesnt make it so
322608 either that or i read the archives you wouldnt make much of a detective mate
322609 you sound a lot like my neighbours cat when i ran over its tail with the lawnmower
322610 its that taxing to check whether i spell words with our instead of or
322611 there is no evidence that he thought it was inaccurate at the time he used it
322612 you would propose that he post them in what format
322613 engage being a transitive verb as defined by the preposition
322614 i think i can safely assume that a you believe the figure i posted and b your own figure is lower
322615 of you getting nailed its a mental picture id rather not remind myself of
322616 he posted articles from reputable sources right here the discussion was here not on wikipedia
322617 perhaps that would explain kbs insistence on insulting my intelligence and literacy which if youd been reading along youd know occurred before i posted that
322618 like ic who e mailed chumpskys source to check on the accuracy of his
322619 i see so ic is a coward for making known his true identity on an internet site but you who refuse to do so are not a coward
322620 now one can only be qualified to criticize chumpsky if they have spoken to him directly
322621 that is not what he said but he did suggest it might be a good idea to read him first
322622 kb specifically told me to write to chomsky and ask him why he quoted a certain
322623 now one can only be qualified to criticize chumpsky if they have spoken to him directly
322624 run on sentences are not noted as an outstanding testament to literacy
322625 sigh the point was that my society is not america
322626 both are equally ridiculous excuses that you pulled out of your sses
322627 youre right chomsky quoted a secondary source who repeated a fact that he thought wasnt accurate
322628 phew i was afraid chomskys credibility might come into question for a moment there lucky you set me straight
322629 and he did not say it wasnt accurate he suggested that it might be exaggerated
322630 i mean these places are the antithesis of good democratic socialist governments other than perhaps using some of the lefts lingo
322631 and still hasnt done their homework on the totalitarain comment
322632 one of your leftard assclowns made the comment that totalitarian governments were not socialist or left leaning if one uses the terms interchangeably
322633 i asked them to provide the evidence that they were not
322634 your response is not evidence of support to her claim or even to the contrary
322635 iow just because you say it is doesnt make it so provide evidence of the claim that they are not
322636 trying to do it in comments on a blog is pointless its a huge topic socialism itself is a spectrum
322637 no chicken i chose to take my own meaning out of what you wrote krappinghisbeard
322638 i dont read every little thing you write you know sock puppet
322639 this edition of blame bush is brought to you by the letters k and b and the word
322640 no chicken i chose to take my own meaning out of what you wrote
322641 krappinghisbeard got slammed on emperor mishas blog the anti idiotarian rottweiler
322642 banned from michelle malkin she doesnt mind leftards as long as they are polite and keep to the point under discussion
322643 and is hoping someone will hire him as a writer
322644 he hasnt written anything new in at least four years
322645 and the honesty of it was what krapping took issue with
322646 once you slam a leftard they will look for something anything in order to show that somehow they were right about something even if it had no bearing on the subject at hand
322647 krappinghisbeard it is not projection to ask someone to prove what they say
322648 if that were the case then that is all you have been doing from day one
322649 if i were the president of your alma mater i would revoke your degree
322650 no chicken i chose to take my own meaning out of what you wrote krappinghisbeard
322651 no i have not i still want you to name one totalitarian government that isnt socialist or left wing
322652 you still cant do it and neither can your leftist friends
322653 if anyone needs to take political spectrum 101 it is you leftards
322654 interesting that you would know what kb wrote from an unattributed comment
322655 i will change it to drooler instead of chicken and that is essentially what krappinghisbeard and you do
322656 infer meanings or decide what the meaning is even though you are totally wrong
322657 now what totalitarian government have you found that isnt socialist
322658 kb no im not cigar club paul i have never been to las vegas
322659 however i find your likening of certain writers here to members of religious cults i believe thats what you said very interesting indeed
322660 and how many more times will this need to take place
322661 rest assured that in each and every instance in which i use it i am being facetious
322662 youre right chomsky quoted a secondary source who repeated a fact that he thought wasnt accurate
322663 i dont believe he said this in his communications with ic for all we know he could have been in doubt over the figure the whole time
322664 youre attempt at making something out of nothing once again supports my thesis about the deperation which is typical among the indoctrinated when they try and force their fairy tale notion of events into reality
322665 i read the exchange with ic myself i was not informed by anyone else what conclusions i should draw from it
322666 it was not a person getting a quote and thinking it was too high at that moment or he wouldnt have used it as a reference
322667 actually he still could have used it as a reference even were he to think it too high at the time which theres no evidence to support and would still have done nothing wrong whatsoever
322668 perhaps he might have said that he wasnt sure about this number but
322669 chomsky the original author of the book did not bother to check with the original source but this is not a problem to you
322670 ic simply took a quote from a source and used it which is the same thing you are saying chomsky did and you are claiming he did nothing wrong
322671 either it works both ways or it doesnt work at all
322672 he opted out for stopping the reseqarch at a point convenient to support his fairy tale desire to try and make chomsky out to be dishonest which he wasnt
322673 chomsky opted for stopping his research at a point that supported his idea that the iaf was in turkey which it probably isnt
322674 you have no proof either way as to whether chomsky was dishonest youre simply claiming it is so because you are indoctrinated
322675 ic was in fact dishonest and its been demonstrated repeatedly
322676 he posted the exact text of his e mail communications go back and read them you fucking liar
322677 and it most certainly was not chomsky using a source after the source backtracked slightly on his original statement
322678 again you have not the faintest idea whether chomskys use of the source was an innocent mistake or a deliberate deceit
322679 and you are not judging him by the standard to which youre trying to hold ic
322680 even though ic is merely a poster on a blog and chomsky is supposedly a renowned academic
322681 how amny times are you going to allow me the opportunity to make you look the buffoon
322682 its a little ironic that you spelled that sentence wrong
322683 and i dont look like a buffoon to anyone but you and your similarly indoctrinated friends
322684 phew i was afraid chomskys credibility might come into question for a moment there lucky you set me straight
322685 ive set you straight many times so far and chomskys credibility is intact and in fine condition
322686 are you ever going to get around to defening the truman speech
322687 and in part its with thanks to folks like you who keep demonstrating him to be correct regarding his writings on the indoctrinated mind and how it works
322688 is it because we are evil like king ahab and dont want to listen to his elijah like prophecies
322689 you should be worried a little more about your credibility and your inability to read and understand words
322690 let me guess your inability to type and your frequent incoherent sentences have nothing remotely to do with your literacy
322691 and he did not say it wasnt accurate he suggested that it might be exaggerated
322692 for one the fact that he is willing to repeat information without checking its accuracy
322693 calls into question his knowledge on the topic and perhaps his integrity as does it chomskys
322694 he perhaps because of your drooling problem you have drowned out the sequence of events
322695 so why is it a problem that ic didnt either
322696 he had no reason to think that the respected author of a respected journal would lie about what his source had told him
322697 ic read it once and was immediately suspicious of it
322698 in the end ics instincts were borne out chomskys werent
322699 nor is there any evidence so far presented that shows that he did at all
322700 i seem to remember factual accuracy and due diligence playing at least a nominal role in my education
322701 do you really think that if person x writes an article and puts into a journal or newspaper that before i use his comments i must do an entire background check to see if he really wrote it if the person who hes quoted is really a person and if so where he went to grade school etc
322702 if your instincts didnt tell you that you should be doing at least a bare minimum to research such a potentially contentious fact
322703 then perhaps speaking to the source if you couldnt find corroboration elsewhere
322704 the greenest cub journalist knows to use a little initiative in fact checking and due diligence a world renowned academic should be able to do the same
322705 and for someone from the right to be acting like rigorous source investigation is even necessary at all is funny on its face
322706 you have brought up no facts and have done nothing but to avoid the ones being discussed
322707 like chomskys misquoting of pres truman which i have mentioned numerous times
322708 including in the sentence you quoted above and you have yet to address
322709 but then being correct is also wrong when a right wing drooler does it
322710 now one can only be qualified to criticize chumpsky if they have spoken to him directly
322711 chomsky the original author of the book did not bother to check with the original source but this is not a problem to you
322712 ic simply took a quote from a source and used it which is the same thing you are saying chomsky did and you are claiming he did nothing wrong
322713 either it works both ways or it doesnt work at all
322714 he opted out for stopping the reseqarch at a point convenient to support his fairy tale desire to try and make chomsky out to be dishonest which he wasnt
322715 chomsky opted for stopping his research at a point that supported his idea that the iaf was in turkey which it probably isnt
322716 you have no proof either way as to whether chomsky was dishonest youre simply claiming it is so because you are indoctrinated
322717 ic was in fact dishonest and its been demonstrated repeatedly
322718 he posted the exact text of his e mail communications go back and read them you fucking liar
322719 and it most certainly was not chomsky using a source after the source backtracked slightly on his original statement
322720 again you have not the faintest idea whether chomskys use of the source was an innocent mistake or a deliberate deceit
322721 and you are not judging him by the standard to which youre trying to hold ic
322722 even though ic is merely a poster on a blog and chomsky is supposedly a renowned academic
322723 how amny times are you going to allow me the opportunity to make you look the buffoon
322724 its a little ironic that you spelled that sentence wrong
322725 and i dont look like a buffoon to anyone but you and your similarly indoctrinated friends
322726 phew i was afraid chomskys credibility might come into question for a moment there lucky you set me straight
322727 ive set you straight many times so far and chomskys credibility is intact and in fine condition
322728 are you ever going to get around to defending the truman speech
322729 and in part its with thanks to folks like you who keep demonstrating him to be correct regarding his writings on the indoctrinated mind and how it works
322730 is it because we are evil like king ahab and dont want to listen to his elijah like prophecies
322731 you should be worried a little more about your credibility and your inability to read and understand words
322732 let me guess your inability to type and your frequent incoherent sentences have nothing remotely to do with your literacy
322733 and he did not say it wasnt accurate he suggested that it might be exaggerated
322734 for one the fact that he is willing to repeat information without checking its accuracy
322735 calls into question his knowledge on the topic and perhaps his integrity as does it chomskys
322736 he perhaps because of your drooling problem you have drowned out the sequence of events
322737 so why is it a problem that ic didnt either
322738 he had no reason to think that the respected author of a respected journal would lie about what his source had told him
322739 ic read it once and was immediately suspicious of it
322740 in the end ics instincts were borne out chomskys werent
322741 nor is there any evidence so far presented that shows that he did at all
322742 i seem to remember factual accuracy and due diligence playing at least a nominal role in my education
322743 do you really think that if person x writes an article and puts into a journal or newspaper that before i use his comments i must do an entire background check to see if he really wrote it if the person who hes quoted is really a person and if so where he went to grade school etc
322744 if your instincts didnt tell you that you should be doing at least a bare minimum to research such a potentially contentious fact
322745 then perhaps speaking to the source if you couldnt find corroboration elsewhere
322746 the greenest cub journalist knows to use a little initiative in fact checking and due diligence a world renowned academic should be able to do the same
322747 and for someone from the right to be acting like rigorous source investigation is even necessary at all is funny on its face
322748 you have brought up no facts and have done nothing but to avoid the ones being discussed
322749 like chomskys misquoting of pres truman which i have mentioned numerous times
322750 including in the sentence you quoted above and you have yet to address
322751 xxxlaxlibtard when are you going to post that quote about me calling your discussion of art propaganda
322752 you got slammed royally over your wanting me to be euthanized
322753 instead you are a slimy internet weasel squeezer who not only cant shoot straight but who cant keep his mouth shut
322754 chomsky the original author of the book did not bother to check with the original source but this is not a problem to you
322755 its not a problem in any way shape or form assuming you stick to the conventions of usual scholarship
322756 the problem is simply that you once again want it to be a problem
322757 ic is your cognitive dissonance still preventing you from understanding this simple point or are you just lying as usual
322758 my cognitive dissonance stems from trying to reconcile the errors of my favourite author with my godlike worship of his infallibility
322759 and im still not ic by the way no matter how much you want me to be
322760 this has been dealt with a hundred times already and as of yet nothing at all has been demonstrated other than the professor though his sources numbers may have been exaggerated upon reflection and after years had gone by
322761 ill make this simple for you chomskys info was a wrong b right
322762 chomsky a didnt make an effort to verify the information
322763 ic a did make an attempt and was told it may not be accurate
322764 if you answered b to any of those lose a turn
322765 now please demonstrate how this has anything at all to do with chomsky
322766 youre right discussing chomskys use of sources in his work has nothing to do with chomsky
322767 in fact its very likely bush planted that source there in the first place
322768 ic simply took a quote from a source and used it which is the same thing you are saying chomsky did and you are claiming he did nothing wrong
322769 no im claiming that chomsky did nothing wrong but that ic did
322770 you know as most all of my evidence has demonstrated already
322771 its just that it looked really really similar to what i left in the toilet the other night after a curry
322772 either it works both ways or it doesnt work at all
322773 no this in incorrect as the two things you are comparing are not the same
322774 or say a complete lack of information that corroborates the single source whose highly contentious claim he chose to run with
322775 right so now in order to criticise chomsky its necessary to travel back in time i see
322776 ic wanting to try and confirm his already preconceived fairy tale notion that
322777 he simply said the number sounded like b s and he backed it up
322778 asked the source years later about this number and he said it
322779 i think ics job is selling stuff on the internet mate
322780 if you want the person whose job is supposedly is to write accurate books thatd be chomsky
322781 its so far away from being touched that its actually becoming less touched as we speak or something
322782 its quite simple and ive asked the questions 500 times already
322783 its quite simple and ive already done it about 500 times already
322784 1 demonstrate that the original source either lied about his data exaggerated it underexaggerated it said he was just joking or whatever
322785 no one said he did any of those things ic said he thought chomskys claim that 12 of the iaf was in turkey was b s
322786 you dont seem to be getting this i wonder what the problem could be
322787 2 demonstrate that the professor who used the source either made some sort of typo lied out his butt exaggerated underexaggerated was just joking or whatever
322788 oh right its because youre trying to have a completely different discussion
322789 where you make all the rules as to what can be talked about and what cant whats valid and what isnt
322790 uhhh he did this because i said so even if he didnt
322791 3 demonstrate how either one or two would have any bearing whatsoever on chomskys seeing the article printed in a professional journal and using the data in his own writings was somehow deceitful or even remotely bad scholarship
322792 using a single secondary source as the sole basis for making a contentious claim is the epitome of good scholarship
322793 there are many more aspects which could be dealt with but we can stick with these for now
322794 he opted out for stopping the reseqarch at a point convenient to support his fairy tale desire to try and make chomsky out to be dishonest which he wasnt
322795 chomsky opted for stopping his research at a point that supported his idea that the iaf was in turkey which it probably isnt
322796 chomsky used a single secondary source as the sole basis for making a contentious claim
322797 and the source backed out on him when ic asked him about it
322798 the iaf was and is in turkey and has been for years
322799 that the israeli military has been in turkey is not an issue to anyone as far as im aware
322800 but that doesnt change the fact that chomsky uses inaccurate or unreliable sources
322801 sorry but ill take chomskys the professors and even the military fellow who the professor referred to over ics drooling ass word and day of the week
322802 then since the professor is the one who said the figure was probably exaggerated i guess youre f cked
322803 that being said ill take and second graders word over his
322804 lolz dude its not really so important to me that i would consider reading satire
322805 but then again im really not sure why were talking about ic as if he were someone else
322806 the fact that i can pick up facts at a speed that you apparently consider impossible
322807 to the point that you think i must be a sockpuppet isnt really a ringing endorsement of your intellect
322808 you have no proof either way as to whether chomsky was dishonest youre simply claiming it is so because you are indoctrinated
322809 and by the way you wrote the sentence that you just quoted not me
322810 also its not my responsibility to demonstrate anything at all regarding chomskys supposed dishonesty as im not the drooler making the claim that he is
322811 then its not ics or my responsibility to prove anything regarding chomskys supposed honesty
322812 im just going to assume that hes full of shit
322813 most educated folks would know that this is the responsibility of the person making the claim
322814 i didnt make the claim that he was dishonest nor did ic iirc
322815 perhaps this is not the best time to talk about your evaporating iq
322816 mm hmm feel free to post yours aaaaaany time youre ready
322817 if you actually had the reading comprehension skills you seem to ascribe to yourself youd see that what ive been saying all along is that it was shoddy work on the part of a supposedly highbrow and reputable academic not dishonesty
322818 that is of course quite apart from the fact that no one was trying to do it in the first place
322819 you do realise that simply dismissing others arguments doesnt invalidate them dont you
322820 ic was in fact dishonest and its been demonstrated repeatedly
322821 plenty of people pay good money for what those freeloaders were getting on our tax dollar
322822 well since youre making the claim i presume youre going to assume the burden of providing evidence you know in order to avoid violating the principle that youre trying to apply to others
322823 he posted the exact text of his e mail communications
322824 which is quite possibly because that wasnt the point who knew
322825 but if you still think you see something there please be specific and demonstrate how this shows chomskys dishonesty
322826 and it most certainly was not chomsky using a source after the source backtracked slightly on his original statement
322827 again you have not the faintest idea whether chomskys use of the source was an innocent mistake or a deliberate deceit
322828 that isnt my job nor is it of any interest to me as there is no issue
322829 thats why i find it odd that you constantly bring it up since i didnt mention honesty to begin with
322830 that being said chomskys use of the source was not a mistake as far as anything has been shown dumbass
322831 why would you think i need an analogy to understand what youre trying to say
322832 the fact that i dont accept it is because its weak not because i dont know what it means
322833 perhaps you dont remember that i told you several times im not ic
322834 perhaps since youre claiming that i am you could put your money where your mouth is
322835 here ill try o dumb it down to the level of a germ
322836 props to tha crew nice im completely unsirprised by the inclusion of not a single conservative poster in that list
322837 despite signs of intelligence from some that are completely unquestionable by either side of the aisle
322838 and you are not judging him by the standard to which youre trying to hold ic
322839 when chomsky used his source there was no evidence it was incorrect
322840 there was equally as much evidence that it was correct
322841 okay ic saw the figure thought it looked suspicious and checked with the source to be told that in fact it was suspicious
322842 would you care to provide the exact sentence of ics that was a lie
322843 even though ic is merely a poster on a blog and chomsky is supposedly a renowned academic
322844 of course that a rightwinger would be sympathetic to a liar after all look who theyve been supporting throughout recent history is of no surprise to no one at all
322845 whats especially intriguing is the fact that your entire pseudo response pretty much confirms many of chomskys own writings on propganda and its effects indoctrination etc
322846 disagreeing with what chomsky writes and questioning his motives reinforces his writings on propaganda and indoctrination
322847 there are many other signs but these will do for now
322848 how amny times are you going to allow me the opportunity to make you look the buffoon
322849 its a little ironic that you spelled that sentence wrong
322850 its even more ironic that you would say that someone
322851 which is ironic given the fact that others literacy is an ongoing theme within your posting
322852 its the only part of that sentence i thought necessary of responding to
322853 and i dont look like a buffoon to anyone but you and your similarly indoctrinated friends
322854 and its really sort of weak to start trying to use the same charges im demonstrating that you have against me
322855 i seem to remember asking you who indoctrinated me and how it happened and not getting a response
322856 uuhhhh uhhh youre indoctrinated because of your demonstration of my indoctrination and uhhh and well thats my proof
322857 youre the one who initially made the claim ive provided evidence to back up my claim that youre indoctrinated that evidence being the shoddy job of fact checking that chomsky did
322858 and the fact that a random poster on the internet busted him for it
322859 only for you to write endless spiels of drivel and mountains of logical fallacies trying to defend it
322860 phew i was afraid chomskys credibility might come into question for a moment there lucky you set me straight
322861 ive set you straight many times so far and chomskys credibility is intact and in fine condition
322862 his credibility is so great it can take a hit from a fact checking missile without a dent
322863 are you ever going to get around to defending the truman speech
322864 apart from the fact that what he said truman said wasnt what truman said
322865 youre right chomskys credibility is so far above reproach that he shouldnt even need to adhere to reality in what he writes
322866 thankyou for removing the scales of right wing indoctrination from my eyes
322867 except for the fact that chomsky misquoted truman in one of his hallowed books and was busted on it and that he personally admitted his mistake and it wasnt just a typo or a misplaced word either
322868 why dont you stop slithering around and admit chomskys mistakes
322869 you know since youre not going to bother defending them
322870 and in part its with thanks to folks like you who keep demonstrating him to be correct regarding his writings on the indoctrinated mind and how it works
322871 is it because we are evil like king ahab and dont want to listen to his elijah like prophecies
322872 i never said that you were evil ic even though you do belong to a cult which was put together by a couple of child raping deviants
322873 youre barking up the wrong tree im a baptist ic is the lds
322874 if you know how important religious affiliations are to most conservatives youd recognise my last sentence as a pretty solid sign that your silly little theory about my identity is quite inaccurate
322875 now do you have any defence of the ridiculous hubris chomsky displayed in that link i gave you
322876 you should be worried a little more about your credibility and your inability to read and understand words
322877 let me guess your inability to type and your frequent incoherent sentences have nothing remotely to do with your literacy
322878 then why would you claim that i dont understand words
322879 since it appears youre going to persist in doing this im going to return the favour
322880 from now on you shall be referred to as mr baldy no reason just like for like you understand
322881 hey i was right spelling has nothing 1 to do with literacy according to kb mr baldy
322882 gatekeeper of wisdom and holder of the secret truths of right and wrong
322883 literacy is now defined as agreement with kb mr baldy over the definition of literacy
322884 and he did not say it wasnt accurate he suggested that it might be exaggerated
322885 for one the fact that he is willing to repeat information without checking its accuracy
322886 why the hell are you still pushing this false notion
322887 perhaps because it isnt a false notion his source made the error sure
322888 but like i said anyone who is writing a dissertation and discovers a supposed fact that is possibly contentious should check it out
322889 its just shoddy not to do so and leads to criticism if the shoddiness is uncovered
322890 there was nothing to check and the claim that it may have been exaggerated came years after the quote had been put in an article
322891 finding out that something was wrong afterwards doesnt make it less wrong
322892 again who am i indoctrinated by and what form does my indoctrination take
322893 there was nothing inaccurate at the time it was used
322894 except for probably the presence or otherwise of 12 of the iaf in turkey
322895 or at least not known to be by either the professor or chomsky
322896 why are you trying to persist that someone knew the number to be exaggerated at the time the article was written
322897 i wish youd discard that particular straw man its not helping things
322898 possibly because no one has been trying to demonstrate it
322899 where did i try to prove that chomsky was dishonest
322900 did he stand by his figure or did he back away from it
322901 you are soooooo desperate its embarrassing that you keep denying the basics
322902 did he stand by his figure or did he back away from it
322903 calls into question his knowledge on the topic and perhaps his integrity
322904 it calls in nothing and you are in no position to infer that it does as you know exactly nothing about neither the professor or chomsky
322905 if chomsky and or the professor did in fact know that the figure was likely exaggerated but used it anyway which would be necessary for either of their knowledge concerning the issue to be above question then they are guilty of deceit
322906 luckily for you you have zero evidence to suggest that either of them knew any better
322907 the only thing called into question is how your indoctrination effects your ability to think rationally
322908 lets see the source of a figure was unsure about it when asked
322909 this demonstrates that he a had sufficient knowledge to state that it was either correct or exaggerated
322910 if b how does this not call into question his knowledge of the issue about which he lacked sufficient knowledge to decisively make a judgement either way
322911 even at very basic levels and how the resulting dishonesty which is produced is projected onto those who you
322912 me projecting my dishonesty onto chomsky because i think he is evil because im indoctrinated is honestly the best explanation you can come up with for why were having this debate
322913 you have no integrity at all as far as i can see and are 100 dedicated to lying out your ass
322914 holding someone accountable for using suspect facts or misquoting a speech made in a public arena demonstrates a lack of integrity
322915 regardless of how embarrassing it makes you look and how much evidence there is to prove it
322916 he perhaps because of your drooling problem you have drowned out the sequence of events
322917 so why are you dedicating so much time to a non issue
322918 so why is it a problem that ic didnt either
322919 because ic is the liar whose argument that chomsky is deceitful
322920 did he or did he not back up his assumption that the figure was suspicious
322921 and its certainly not wrong 11 how dare you droolers suggest otherwise 11
322922 you are sitting here making my argument for me now
322923 like how i proved chomsky right by disagreeing with him
322924 you are in effect saying that its okay for ic to consciously seek out a fairy tale even if he has to lie about the facts to prove that chomsky is deceitful
322925 and that ic can be deceitful and its okay because it supports his fairy tale
322926 where was his deceit he contacted the source and used the sources words to back up his contention
322927 if thats deceit then youd better give the rest of us the progressive liberal definition of truthfulness because it apparently differs from ours
322928 ic using same source on internet but not double checking it bad
322929 he had no reason to think that the respected author of a respected journal would lie about what his source had told him
322930 it seems like only a moment ago that you were claiming that inability to independently determine the accuracy or otherwise of the source did not call chomskys knowledge of the issue into question
322931 i guess the two minute mark after which liberals positions become invalid and are not to be referred to any more must have been up
322932 have you ever looked into the back of any book other than the national enquirer
322933 there was no reason to check as the professor whom he used was a respected professor from a respected journal
322934 but that same professor cannot be used by ic to back up his own argument apparently
322935 and you are still inferring that there was something wrong or some reason for chomsky to have to have checked something
322936 yes the fact that his source said the information was likely wrong
322937 well my source said the number was 12 but several years later im going to find out that it may have been exaggerated a little but given that its now im not aware of this yet so just to be safe you should probably lie and just assume that i will eventually say the number may have been exaggerated
322938 ic read it once and was immediately suspicious of it
322939 you seem to know an awful lot about this ic guy ic
322940 after reading the 12 figure he posted something to the effect that it was bullshit
322941 well since youre making the claim i presume youre going to assume the burden of providing evidence you know in order to avoid violating the principle that youre trying to apply to others
322942 he posted the exact text of his e mail communications
322943 which is quite possibly because that wasnt the point who knew
322944 but if you still think you see something there please be specific and demonstrate how this shows chomskys dishonesty
322945 and it most certainly was not chomsky using a source after the source backtracked slightly on his original statement

323034 regardless of how embarrassing it makes you look and how much evidence there is to prove it
323035 he perhaps because of your drooling problem you have drowned out the sequence of events
323036 so why are you dedicating so much time to a non issue
323037 so why is it a problem that ic didnt either
323038 because ic is the liar whose argument that chomsky is deceitful
323039 did he or did he not back up his assumption that the figure was suspicious
323040 and its certainly not wrong 11 how dare you droolers suggest otherwise 11
323041 you are sitting here making my argument for me now
323042 like how i proved chomsky right by disagreeing with him
323043 you are in effect saying that its okay for ic to consciously seek out a fairy tale even if he has to lie about the facts to prove that chomsky is deceitful
323044 and that ic can be deceitful and its okay because it supports his fairy tale
323045 where was his deceit he contacted the source and used the sources words to back up his contention
323046 if thats deceit then youd better give the rest of us the progressive liberal definition of truthfulness because it apparently differs from ours
323047 ic using same source on internet but not double checking it bad
323048 he had no reason to think that the respected author of a respected journal would lie about what his source had told him
323049 it seems like only a moment ago that you were claiming that inability to independently determine the accuracy or otherwise of the source did not call chomskys knowledge of the issue into question
323050 i guess the two minute mark after which liberals positions become invalid and are not to be referred to any more must have been up
323051 have you ever looked into the back of any book other than the national enquirer
323052 there was no reason to check as the professor whom he used was a respected professor from a respected journal
323053 but that same professor cannot be used by ic to back up his own argument apparently
323054 and you are still inferring that there was something wrong or some reason for chomsky to have to have checked something
323055 yes the fact that his source said the information was likely wrong
323056 well my source said the number was 12 but several years later im going to find out that it may have been exaggerated a little but given that its now im not aware of this yet so just to be safe you should probably lie and just assume that i will eventually say the number may have been exaggerated
323057 ic read it once and was immediately suspicious of it
323058 you seem to know an awful lot about this ic guy ic
323059 after reading the 12 figure he posted something to the effect that it was bullshit
323060 except what a stupid fucked up twisted slut who is in serious need of meds you are
323061 your rants about not banning janny and you not tracking ring false
323062 ic did prove that the figure was inaccurate according to the source that chomsky used
323063 that could mean anything from non existent to never happened
323064 it was provided in context for the time frame he was writing about
323065 after all what academic wants to go on record as being the one who called chomsky a liar
323066 there are words used to describe it as inaccurate or misleading or non attributable
323067 you claim to be an academic you know how that works
323068 so why dont you get off your lazy backside and prove chomsky correct beyond his statements
323069 ic went to one of his quoted sources why dont you do the same
323070 not to mention cricket posting here as cricket and not as feelthelove as she intended
323071 posting as xxxxlaxlibtard here and x3 trying to impress someone else on the above thread you have not proven one thing
323072 except what a stupid fucked up twisted slut who is in serious need of meds you are
323073 kb has posted two comments that are 75 pages long each
323074 that is a sure sign the person is in a psychotic state
323075 if anyone out there knows where he lives please send an ambulance and a team of policemen because kb is really close to either hurting himself or hurting someone else
323076 but when this country my country does x y and z its rather pathetic and should not do it
323077 some analysts say 12 of the iaf may be in turkey
323078 uh okay theres no way im answering all of that
323079 not to mention that its the same shite you already posted
323080 ics argument was that 12 of the israeli air force likely wasnt in israel he got backup on that
323081 ics argument failed precisely because of his contacting the professor
323082 the professors answers demonstrated that chomsky did nothing wrong as ive already pointed out
323083 or fail to know enough about israeli military dealings to know 12 is likely an exaggeration
323084 or fail to acknowledge the possibility that the source was shaky
323085 ics argument was that 12 of the israeli air force likely wasnt in israel he got backup on that
323086 12 of the israeli air force likely wasnt in israel
323087 or fail to know enough about israeli military dealings to know 12 is likely an exaggeration
323088 or fail to acknowledge the possibility that the source was shaky
323089 12 of the israeli air force likely wasnt in israel
323090 exaggerated and was intended by the source to indicate the strong security relationship that existed between turkey and israel
323091 a basic mistake that a journalist at the crappiest small town tabloid knows not to make
323092 fair enough by your own admission then the best of his knowledge was not enough to ensure accuracy chomsky fails
323093 your indoctrination is preventing you from grasping something so simple is quite odd but predictable
323094 set israel on fire and then in an almost inaudible voice if attacked
323095 if israel attacks us we will set them on fire
323096 and the biggest question of all why when an author makes a basic mistake
323097 that a journalist at the crappiest small town tabloid knows not to make and was caught doing it do you insist everyone else is wrong and indoctrinated
323098 and why do you insist that disagreeing with you means i am indoctrinated
323099 could it be shock horror i can barely gasp out the words that you are the indoctrinated one
323100 or fail to know enough about israeli military dealings to know 12 is likely an exaggeration
323101 im afraid that he probably knows more than the israeli military than most of the folks in the israeli military
323102 never mind what the babykilling jooohs know or dont know
323103 chomsky knows so much about the israeli military that he knows more than is actually true its incredible
323104 or fail to acknowledge the possibility that the source was shaky
323105 why would he acknowledge this at all as this was not then or has not now been determined at all
323106 the fact that he told ic he wasnt sure on the number and it was probably exaggerated
323107 what more does a source have to do before you will admit they are shaky
323108 12 of the israeli air force likely wasnt in israel
323109 here is a link to all the turkish embassies abroad to include the us and japan
323110 you will find any excuse to weasel out of this
323111 so i am prepared for all kinds of flatulence from you about how chomsky didnt lie
323112 if the pseudo intellectual can claim sources then by all means go to the turks themselves asshole
323113 exaggerated and was intended by the source to indicate the strong security relationship that existed between turkey and israel
323114 a basic mistake that a journalist at the crappiest small town tabloid knows not to make
323115 fair enough by your own admission then the best of his knowledge was not enough to ensure accuracy chomsky fails
323116 the figure could have been exaggerated to reinforce the point that israel and turkey have major military ties
323117 your indoctrination is preventing you from grasping something so simple is quite odd but predictable
323118 set israel on fire and then in an almost inaudible voice if attacked
323119 if israel attacks us we will set them on fire
323120 and the biggest question of all why when an author makes a basic mistake
323121 that a journalist at the crappiest small town tabloid knows not to make and was caught doing it do you insist everyone else is wrong and indoctrinated
323122 and why do you insist that disagreeing with you means i am indoctrinated
323123 could it be shock horror i can barely gasp out the words that you are the indoctrinated one
323124 or fail to know enough about israeli military dealings to know 12 is likely an exaggeration
323125 im afraid that he probably knows more than the israeli military than most of the folks in the israeli military
323126 never mind what the babykilling jooohs know or dont know
323127 chomsky knows so much about the israeli military that he knows more than is actually true its incredible
323128 or fail to acknowledge the possibility that the source was shaky
323129 why would he acknowledge this at all as this was not then or has not now been determined at all
323130 the fact that he told ic he wasnt sure on the number and it was probably exaggerated
323131 what more does a source have to do before you will admit they are shaky
323132 12 of the israeli air force likely wasnt in israel
323133 here is a link to all the turkish embassies abroad to include the us and japan
323134 you will find any excuse to weasel out of this
323135 he did nothing wrong because kbs thought process period look at the facts 11111
323136 so i am prepared for all kinds of flatulence from you about how chomsky didnt lie
323137 if the pseudo intellectual can claim sources then by all means go to the turks themselves asshole
323138 to indicate the strong security relationship that existed between turkey and israel
323139 you are basing value judgements purely on your own personal feelings and reasoning and that of people like chomsky whose ideologies you adhere to because they match what you feel
323140 this is what indoctrination is kb not disagreeing with someone over whether or not someone else did wrong
323141 chomsky was quoting a source who told ic that the number was highly exaggerated
323142 to indicate the strong security relationship that existed between turkey and israel
323143 now why dont you ask the turks if they allow israel to have part of their air force in turkey
323144 chomsky was quoting a source who told ic that the number was highly exaggerated
323145 iow a third hand third party information that he didnt bother to verify from that source
323146 ic has pointed out on another thread that turkey regularly patrols their airspace to ward off any iaf incursions
323147 so let us carry the 12 to that conclusion the 12 of the iaf that chomskys source alleges is in turkey flies recon missions over turkish airspace because that is as close as israel will ever get to an iaf presence there
323148 so krappinghisbeard when are you going to contact the turkish embassy
323149 now why dont you ask the turks if they allow israel to have part of their air force in turkey
323150 if the iaf has a presence in turkey it is with the cooperation of the americans and the turks as the turks would most likely not let them build a base but use one already in existence for training purposes
323151 training is not the same thing as a permanent base
323152 oh well it was bound to happen sooner or later case closed you lose
323153 oh well it was bound to happen sooner or later case closed you lose
323154 whoever wrote filthes little article about the nsdap on wiki tried their hardest to suggest that the nsdap were not lefties
323155 and the fact that i have enough intelligence not to post personal details on a blog like this has nothing to do with cowardice its common sense big time one way or another courage doesnt come into it anywhere
323156 and that you would even try to put this forward just after having had you ass handed to you repeatedly with evidence every single time
323157 what evidence find me a single piece of evidence youve posted in this thread go on you cant even be arsed to do what ic did and contact someone to back up your opinion
323158 all youve done is tell us why you think chomsky didnt make a mistake and were wrong not him thats evidence of nothing
323159 no what demonstrates that you are the one who is intellectually dishonest is the fact you keep claiming to have provided
323160 hell you never even read the entire data to see what was taking place
323161 ignore that of which you cant respond and hope is disappears
323162 you thought that ic made some sort of move to contact olsen when i was the one who did so first
323163 i debated only the implications on chomsky of what chomskys source told ic
323164 how is what you may have said to the source previously relevant
323165 now which books of chomskys did you say you had read
323166 this is relevant to chomskys use of shaky figures how exactly
323167 oh well it was bound to happen sooner or later
323168 how so i pointed out that a rookie reporter for the daily newspaper in buttcrack iowa would be held to higher fact checking standards than youre holding chomsky to
323169 and that if chomsky didnt check his source he either was negligent
323170 lacked the requisite knowledge or instinct to make the call that the source needed checking
323171 something that ic tipped to immediately mind you or that he simply included it because it fit with the point he was making
323172 all youve got is that the source said it was shaky
323173 theres a very long record of it just above this comment
323174 a reference of what a poor debater you are and how you lack any kind of grasp of the importance of facts or anything that is sourced from without your own self serving brain
323175 but if i were you i wouldnt look back because its not going to say what you
323176 its going to say that ic made the effort to check chomskys facts and then he and i pointed out the various implications of the bad sourcing of those facts
323177 while you simply told us your viewpoint on what all that meant
323178 without providing anything to back it up and called it a day because the only criteria you need to satisfy yourself of success is feeling like you were successful regardless of the facts
323179 any literate reader would be instantly tripped by your claims that youve presented
323180 perhaps you could even read the material here and actually think you did prove something but that only further demonstrates that as i said earlier you really are indoctrinated
323181 that is the poorest argument i have ever heard for someone trying to cover their tracks
323182 you dont get to turn the tables on others and claim theyre indoctrinated unless you back up your own claims first
323183 using some form of rational factual argument which is not what you have done here
323184 having dug their hole beyond escape and the only escape would be to demonstrate a modicum of honesty and just admit that they fucked up they go hell bent digging like it was going out of style
323185 to indicate the strong security relationship that existed between turkey and israel
323186 and that you would even try to put this forward just after having had you ass handed to you repeatedly with evidence every single time
323187 what evidence find me a single piece of evidence youve posted in this thread go on you cant even be arsed to do what ic did and contact someone to back up your opinion
323188 all youve done is tell us why you think chomsky didnt make a mistake and were wrong not him thats evidence of nothing
323189 chomsky never made a mistake no one has proved that he did
323190 no what demonstrates that you are the one who is intellectually dishonest is the fact you keep claiming to have provided
323191 hell you never even read the entire data to see what was taking place
323192 i dont recall olsen saying that chomsky had done something wrong
323193 i dont recall him saying chomsky hadnt done anything wrong
323194 and that you would even try to put this forward just after having had you ass handed to you repeatedly with evidence every single time
323195 i have given evidence about 50 times now that nothing wrong took place
323196 all youve done is tell us why you think chomsky didnt make a mistake and were wrong not him
323197 and you are projecting your own techniques onto your debate opponents
323198 chomsky did not make a mistake here whether i like it dont like it am indifferent love it hate it or anything else
323199 find an independent source to verify that an instance such as this one doesnt qualify as a mistake and you might have a point
323200 youd even have the evidence youre constantly pretending exists to back you up
323201 chomsky simply did nothing wrong and no one has come even within a ballpark of demonstrating that he has
323202 and regarding your being wrong theres also nothing to discuss via interpretation
323203 blah blah blah the same bullshit over and over and over again with the same lack of basis the first time around
323204 unless someone else out there has a better argument for your inability or should i say disability to read and understand words
323205 how about your inability to understand the concept that the existence or otherwise of evidence doesnt depend on what you say
323206 saying i have no evidence does nothing to address the evidence i have
323207 saying you have evidence does nothing to address the fact youve provided none
323208 i never said i have proof i said i have evidence
323209 i explained to you numerous times what that evidence means
323210 for someone whos supposedly trained in treating others mental disorders you sure havent got much of a grasp on your own
323211 to indicate the strong security relationship that existed between turkey and israel
323212 plenty of people pay good money for what those freeloaders were getting on our tax dollar
323213 well since youre making the claim i presume youre going to assume the burden of providing evidence you know in order to avoid violating the principle that youre trying to apply to others
323214 he posted the exact text of his e mail communications
323215 which is quite possibly because that wasnt the point who knew
323216 but if you still think you see something there please be specific and demonstrate how this shows chomskys dishonesty
323217 and it most certainly was not chomsky using a source after the source backtracked slightly on his original statement
323218 again you have not the faintest idea whether chomskys use of the source was an innocent mistake or a deliberate deceit
323219 that isnt my job nor is it of any interest to me as there is no issue
323220 thats why i find it odd that you constantly bring it up since i didnt mention honesty to begin with
323221 that being said chomskys use of the source was not a mistake as far as anything has been shown dumbass
323222 why would you think i need an analogy to understand what youre trying to say
323223 and that you would even try to put this forward just after having had you ass handed to you repeatedly with evidence every single time
323224 my use of xxx as a source who backs up my assertion that failure to check sources doesnt constitute wrongdoing
323225 i have given evidence about 50 times now that nothing wrong took place
323226 and you are projecting your own techniques onto your debate opponents
323227 chomsky did not make a mistake here whether i like it dont like it am indifferent love it hate it or anything else
323228 find an independent source to verify that an instance such as this one doesnt qualify as a mistake and you might have a point
323229 youd even have the evidence youre constantly pretending exists to back you up
323230 are you planning to write a book on things you think
323231 ida done so already but then you idiots would think youd won something
323232 we should assume that olsen did not mention his impression in his article or chomsky would have mentioned it as well
323233 by him not mentioning it proves even further that chomsky was correct in his use of his source
323234 are you guys really going to keep trying to drag this non existent thing out
323235 perhaps you could improve on that by providing something factual or at least some sort of evidence rather than just your own opinion
323236 and i have a different take on it than you do
323237 and the evidence supports my view in absentia you providing anything factual to disprove it
323238 all youve done is looked at the evidence and spun it as irrelevant
323239 youre making the exact same arguments kb is trying to
323240 and ive already answered them over and over again because he basically repeats the same crap every time he posts
323241 he got an expert opinion from chomskys source that the number was shaky
323242 he de facto proved that an expert on the topic doubts the accuracy of chomskys work
323243 he expressed amazement at the iaf having any such planes in a muslim as he put it country
323244 he got an expert opinion supporting his challenge of the statement
323245 maybe so i didnt though and the current debate is with me not him
323246 besides theres no evidence chomsky wasnt lying youre assuming he wasnt
323247 and he got an expert opinion stating that they probably werent
323248 chomskys responsible for whats in his writing no one else
323249 ic got as far as that source olsen who himself got the figure from elsewhere and who on reflection said that the figure of 12 could may might have been exaggerated by that original source
323250 ic quit there preening himself deciding hed proved his case
323251 his original case was that that proportion of the israeli air force probably werent in turkey
323252 in other words nobody has reached any source which has cagetorically denied the 12
323253 because im finished with your nitpicking and suggestions that chomsky did anything wrong
323254 all he did was use some analogies and arguments that are relevant to him but constitute nothing in the way of evidence or facts
323255 then he simply said hed proved his point as effectively as a simple mathematical equation
323256 i have responded to the your point over and over and over again
323257 you try to give analogies in lieu of arguing facts or presenting anything besides your own opinion
323258 and you insist that others accept them when theyre simply irrelevant
323259 you tell others theyre illiterate when you can barely string a fucking sentence together
323260 youve got nothing that would qualify you to be teaching anybody about politics
323261 ive been trying to help you understand something which an elementary school would have little difficulty with and you persist in not trying to understand the point
323262 in other words youre losing the debate because you have no facts or evidence so you adopt some smarmy posture of higher knowledge
323263 were you giving any indication at all that you were honesty attempting to find the correct answer this would not be the case
323264 the correct answer would be the one that is correct not necessarily the one that you arrive at
323265 right right its for my own good heard that one before
323266 it has been demonstrated numerous times you fucking bare faced liar
323267 and you never responded to the post you never even acknowledged it had been made
323268 dont think you can just ignore that and come back with the same old high handed shit about others not understanding your arguments
323269 as far as that goes there really is no argument other than the fact that chomsky the professor and the original source as done nothing inappropriate or at least it hasnt been demonstrated that they have
323270 its indicated that at least one of them may have thats a little better than youve got on your side
323271 which consists of your own opinion and precisely nothing else
323272 thats why i find it odd that youd keep going with the fairy tale non issue
323273 then you can get on with something useful like learning the first thing about israeli palestinian relations
323274 its this sort of behavior which makes you resemble ic all the more as this was one of his defining characteristics
323275 youre making another fucking stupid claim thats not even remotely based on reality
323276 i presume he cant even be bothered arguing with you
323277 im just looking at the quantity of drivel mandible has managed to write about this statement below
323278 if you think a statement like the above makes any sense then you are a fucking idiot period
323279 the is not now nor has there ever been an issue here
323280 it will continue to be an issue until you come up with something better than simply stating your opinion that it isnt one
323281 for starters and since youve supposedly already liaised with olsen
323282 e mail him again and ask him for the text of the original article
323283 til you get some sort of fact evidence opionion or well anything to back your argument up youre really just talking shit and presenting it as pure unbridled truth
323284 how long will you continue to beat this horse which was never even born
323285 i am not going to indulge your stubborn refusal to comprehend facts once again
323286 the reasons behind my argument are clearly laid out in my previous posts
323287 why would i post them again now only for you to run off on another tangent about my supposed illiteracy
323288 youre making the exact same arguments kb is trying to
323289 and ive already answered them over and over again because he basically repeats the same crap every time he posts
323290 he got an expert opinion from chomskys source that the number was shaky
323291 but i did it first so i get to say whats right
323292 he de facto proved that an expert on the topic doubts the accuracy of chomskys work
323293 he expressed amazement at the iaf having any such planes in a muslim as he put it country
323294 he got an expert opinion supporting his challenge of the statement
323295 maybe so i didnt though and the current debate is with me not him
323296 besides theres no evidence chomsky wasnt lying youre assuming he wasnt
323297 and he got an expert opinion stating that they probably werent
323298 chomskys responsible for whats in his writing no one else
323299 ic got as far as that source olsen who himself got the figure from elsewhere and who on reflection said that the figure of 12 could may might have been exaggerated by that original source
323300 ic quit there preening himself deciding hed proved his case
323301 his original case was that that proportion of the israeli air force probably werent in turkey
323302 you f cking piece of sh t youre a f cking moron
323303 one of the most offensive sites ive seen in blogtopia
323304 yall get to keep yer gunz the gubment aint gonna take yer gunz away yeeeeehaw hooray fer gunz
323305 if tony scalia would stop listening to rush limbaugh and go to college he wouldve known that
323306 i dont read every little thing you write you know sock puppet
323307 the majority would have us believe that over 200 years ago the framers made a choice to limit the tools available to elected officials wishing to regulate civilian uses of weapons
323308 why is it so hard for you to believe that someone has read chomsky and still think he is full of shit
323309 just the ones that rebelled i explicitly included ireland so you wouldnt feel left out
323310 the whole body of men declared by law amenable to military service without enlistment whether armed and drilled or not
323311 they are just as flawed as we are just in different ways
323312 xxxlaxlibtard when are you going to post that quote about me calling your discussion of art propaganda
323313 you got slammed royally over your wanting me to be euthanized
323314 instead you are a slimy internet weasel squeezer who not only cant shoot straight but who cant keep his mouth shut
323315 hes like a one legged man in an arse kicking competition hell fall over before the election even starts
323316 i get attacked for using in a very civil way mind you ireland as an example of disarmament
323317 wow i am so sorry that this happened but then again why am i not surprised
323318 outlaw guns and only criminals be they patriots or thugs will have them
323319 i was not dissing ireland i was illustrating a point youre looking for a fight where none exists
323320 i get attacked for using in a very civil way mind you ireland as an example of disarmament
323321 and you dont share a 2000 mile border with a 3rd world country
323322 megatropolis is iron saviors sixth full length album released on the 4th of june 2007
323323 and you dont import poverty on a grand scale no diversity no discord
323324 i apologize if i attributed unintended anger into that but surely you can see how i did it
323325 and if you hadnt been called on it youd have pretended you wrote it yourself and didnt change any of it or fiddle wiht it either
323326 that is mighty big talk coming from someone who has changed names more times than you have your underwear
323327 so happens i decided to put it in that way precisely because with all the hollering about links and so forth i wanted to see if anyone would actually check
323328 i certainly didnt expect a prediction like you made to cover your backside with regard to what you said to ftl but then like i said why am i not surprised
323329 i didnt try to cover up anything i admitted what i did and why i did it
323330 ftl posted a link to the mises institute about the non socialization of hitlers germany and no one checked on it or bothered to refute it
323331 now why would you check out my cut and paste but ignore something that refuted your claim to totalitarian governments not being socialist
323332 why would you back down from ftl with your clairvoyance and then try to pass it off as someone having a laugh
323333 you insist on people answering your questions with the stubborn insistence of a spoilt child
323334 moreover with you accountability is a one way street you have neither honor nor integrity
323335 kb why is it so hard for you to believe that someone has read chomsky and still think he is full of shit
323336 propagandist moonbattery just like the political articles of his i had read previously
323337 he should ask kos if he can be a contributor
323338 and that is the last time i feed the trolls
323339 all i know is arming the proletariat is never a good idea
323340 leftard thinks reading chomsky will convert us into america hating people
323341 when i was in my 20s i read a couple very famous feminist books out of curiosity
323342 because i had to know what the hell feminists were telling women and i wanted to understand
323343 it did not turn me into a man who hates men
323344 in fact it gave me a bad opinion of feminists
323345 i could read every chomsky book and every article and watch every interview and would probably agree with no more than about 1 of what he says
323346 chomsky does not have the power to turn good people into america haters
323347 no more than famous feminists had the power to make me hate myself or my gender
323348 you need a messed up neurotic or better yet psychotic person to start with to accomplish that
323349 why are you here on a satire site you hate
323350 why did you ban janny and then lie about it
323351 have you found that quote where i supposedly called your art discussion propaganda
323352 your choice to accept it or not that you have been treated decently
323353 have a good weekend i truly do mean that given the lushness of ireland about this time of you
323354 nine of the signers of the declaration of independence were of irish origin and 19 presidents of the united states have proudly claimed irish heritage including george washington andrew jackson john f kennedy and ronald reagan
323355 irish americans have served with distinction in every war this nation has fought from revolutionaries john barry and stephen moylan to general douglas macarthur
323356 other influential and renowned figures of irish descent include pioneers buffalo bill cody daniel boone and davy crockett authors flannery oconnor eugene oneill and john ohara civil war photographer matthew brady and entertainers jackie gleason gene kelly and john wayne
323357 these distinguished americans represent only a small sampling of the men and women whose legacy has forever changed our national identity and who trace their ancestry to irelands green shores
323358 oh you we never dated you called me a cunt and tried to feel me up at an assembly and i kicked you in the balls
323359 you are incapable of having a heterosexual relationship with a man because youre just like dick cheneys gay daughter a lesbo
323360 you clean rugs that is not the least bit controversial
323361 you saw me when i was pregnant everyone else here has met my kids why would i lie about something as trivial as having kids or being straight
323362 you faked it you borrowed the kids and showed them to everyone else here without letting me see them just so you could pretend you werent a butch skank besides none of them would recognize a kid if it filed a restraining order against them theyre all taco trollers too
323363 i let you touch my belly when i was carrying but you kept taking your pants off after you explicitly agreed not to do that you blew your chance to ever meet them
323364 you were afraid of me exposing the truth that you dont like the man meat so you kept your imaginary kids away you are incapable of smothering the one eyed snake you whore otherwise prove it
323365 the thought of making sweet tender love to a man disgusts you
323366 no the thought of you disgusts me i dated most of the guys here including some i didnt care for youre sick all you ever talk about is sex and you try to degrade women into submission its a perversion any woman who wont drop trou for you on demand you call a lesbian even when that exchange student fousa abu took pity on you and gave you what you asked for you still accused her of being gay
323367 she didnt do it the way i wanted she did it wrong shes incapable of doing it right because shes in the rosie odonnell fan club
323368 she told me you couldnt get it up and you blamed her
323369 because shes a snatch bandit if she doesnt do it the way i say and make me feel the way i say then shes a ditch digger if i ask whats the square root of 4 and she says anything other than 2 shes
323370 she could say negative 2 that would be correct and you arent entitled to jack shit get over yourself
323371 turn and run away instead of proving youre not a muff diver brock brock brock i totally dismantled you you che i am speechless with what i wont say good helk are all your high school reunions that ummm intense oh like wow man what a total metaphor dude even when that exchange student fousa abu took pity on you and gave you what you asked for you still accused her of being gay
323372 i only took a quick glance at what you wrote above but i have this question for you why are you denying that what i read of chomsky the 1998 interview i completely dissected and and tore to pieces
323373 i did what you ask i showed where he was wrong i did not just say it i demonstrated it in about four long detailed comments
323374 are you ever honest or is this something impossible for you
323375 id start to go into the numbers of things chomsky has been proven full of shit on but im too busy ducking and running for cover from all those phantom iaf planes israel has in turkey
323376 it seems that in order to ratchet up the racism factor a bunch of left wingers decided to leave comments posing as conservatives to prove racism
323377 since i dont have a habit of copy and paste or a history of it the way you do
323378 and fousas say so doesnt count for much anyway he never gives links he just announces things
323379 i suggest you be accountable for your troll behavior here and your sockpuppets
323380 all i have ever seen are urls which you have posted and fousa has posted his but no one bothered to look at them and i dont think he knows how to do an html for a hyper link
323381 you yourself said you wouldnt go to links because you ran your cursor over them and the address showed up in the bottom of the page
323382 find out what the hell youre talking about before you post its generally advisable
323383 you still have not explained why you are here on this blog
323384 were i writing a research paper and attributed that quote with my take on it would you have said i was lying or wrong
323385 just because megapix is not here nor is she b12 either doesnt mean she isnt posting as another sockpuppet
323386 is it because you can post here without your isp being tracked
323387 were i writing a research paper and attributed that quote with my take on it would you have said i was lying or wrong
323388 or because you hate americans and our arrogance and want to take us down a peg or both
323389 you see you didnt attribute my question to me just put quotes around it that does not identify the author or give me credit for asking it so you plagiarised it it only identifies it as a quote nothing else you are guilty of plagiarism
323390 the reason we act as if we own the place is because we comment in the style larry has set
323391 were i writing a research paper and attributed that quote with my take on it would you have said i was lying or wrong
323392 where have i been proven seriously in the wrong i asked a question and you are tap dancing around the answer i gave some reasons you might be here is all in the form of a question i didnt attribute those reasons to you so dont start saying i am proven wrong when you dont stand accused
323393 you have been caught out and refuse to admit anything
323394 kb only in the mind of the loony left such as you could we have a situation where the very source of a story
323395 i am not going to be posting here for awhile
323396 being a leftish moonbat means never having to live in the real world and own up for your actions dont you know this by now
323397 and the source stated in an email which i posted here including the headers that the numbers were bogus
323398 i read what you did with the chomsky interview you were outstanding
323399 just because kb is in denial doesnt mean the rest of us are have a good weekend
323400 ic did prove that the figure was inaccurate according to the source that chomsky used
323401 that could mean anything from non existent to never happened
323402 it was provided in context for the time frame he was writing about
323403 after all what academic wants to go on record as being the one who called chomsky a liar
323404 there are words used to describe it as inaccurate or misleading or non attributable you claim to be an academic you know how that works
323405 so why dont you get off your lazy backside and prove chomsky correct beyond his statements
323406 ic went to one of his quoted sources why dont you do the same
323407 fousas responses to the chomsky interview and his dissection of it are in the archives
323408 why dont you do your own research he is under no obligation to tell you anything beyond that
323409 i usually provide the name of the site the date the headline and a short excerpt
323410 krappinghisbeard yet again posts flatulence and insults that is supposed to pass for what satire try again you get full marks for being stupid irrelevant and dishonest
323411 i provided a link so you will have something to deny today
323412 if you are waiting dont hold your breath kb ic did prove that the figure was inaccurate according to the source that chomsky used
323413 im the chomskynator i leave leftists in a state of stupor
323414 we had no idea this was about the 400 years of quebec city we thought it was about the founding of all of quebec province
323415 krappinghisbeard yet again posts flatulence and insults that is supposed to pass for what satire try again you get full marks for being stupid irrelevant and dishonest
323416 according to census bureaus 2006 american community survey the racial or ethnic makeup of the county was 64
323417 i will dissect this comment with the analysis that it deserves to show up the x3 sockpuppet for what she is rampantly stupid
323418 note that my comment calls krappinghisbeards post for what it is flatulent dishonest irrelevant and stupid
323419 next she saids that i have proved it then wants to know where
323420 how genuinely stupid is that she reads it acknowledges that i am right
323421 i dont need to prove that krappinghisbeard is what i say he is

323426 you have been caught in several lies you have made some accusations that were unfounded and generally speaking in spite of the potty language the resident right wingers here at bb have treated you better than you deserve
323427 i dont need to prove that krappinghisbeard is what i say he is
323428 you just cut and paste but after janny crawled all over your ass about plagiarism which by her posting that you cut and pasted in its entirety and stopped you dead in your tracks
323429 i put up a link to the mises site refuting your claim and you have not addressed that issue on your own once
323430 take you damn dirty gay mouth off my toodle oo

323447 there can be nobody more hypocritical on the face of this earth than these asshole trolls
323448 for the record we do not damn her country and all americans we say goddamn bush cheney and all who blindly support them and weve made that clear
323449 seriously though he probably wont make an announcement until sometime in august
323450 so he loses to mcbush no matter what choice michelle makes for him
323451 the only limiting factor is that the delegates at the convention must know at the convention who it will be
323452 cricket being a bit saccharine but her heart is in the right place
323453 silencing opposition by killing someone is the only way you leftwingers can be superior
323454 deranged dysfunctional people are attracted to the lefts love of hatred
323455 i guess you have taken your meds you tosspot bitch
323456 you go absolutely ballistic and start foaming at the mouth when you get slammed
323457 as i said in my state of the union address liberty is not americas gift to the world liberty is gods gift to human to the human mankind
323458 annoyed more than once over exorcists posts because of my lifestyle choice
323459 take your damn dirty gay mouth off my normal cock
323460 i suggest if you want the answers to those questions you experience them for yourself
323461 as i said in my state of the union address liberty is not americas gift to the world liberty is gods gift to human to the human mankind

323463 limbaughs total package is valued north of 400 million according to media insiders
323464 countries across the globe are turning to free markets and free speech and turning away from ideologies of the past for them the great rediscovery of the 1980s has been that lo and behold the moral way of government is the practical way of government democracy the profoundly good is also the profoundly productive
323465 our nation is chosen by god and commissioned by history to be a model to the world
323466 me24 mentioned that youd been drinking posted by b12 july 02 2008 at 01 39 pm
323467 over the past decades isostatic rebound has more than doubled the size of his familys seafront property
323468 more than 600 people from all over the country have responded in the first 48 hours of our call to tell fox news to stop branding progressives as unpatriotic
323469 we could just as easily have led on the release of a man held without trial for several years a 45 year old algerian alleged to have al qaida links the government has failed to get him deported to his home country because as luck would have it algeria has a tradition of death and torture for such people so at least the country that gave us habeas corpus can hold its head high and say that the man is now on a highly restricted bail order
323470 but if she isnt going to allow people to comment
323471 hypocrisy to you trolls is something that only exists in other people
323472 i think you might have a bit of moral high ground to tell janny to stay away
323473 mandela should stick a very big middle finger straight up in the air and give a big
323474 certainly one of the chief guarantees of freedom under any government no matter how popular and respected is the right of citizens to keep and bear arms the right of citizens to bear arms is just one guarantee against arbitrary government one more safeguard against the tyranny which now appears remote in america but which historically has proven to be always possible
323475 a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
323476 the advantage of being armed which americans possess over the people of almost every other nation
323477 what country can preserve its liberties if its rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance let them take arms
323478 to disarm the people that was the best and most effectual way to enslave them
323479 what sir is the use of a militia it is to prevent the establishment of a standing army the bane of liberty whenever governments mean to invade the rights and liberties of the people they always attempt to destroy the militia in order to raise an army upon their ruins
323480 before a standing army can rule the people must be disarmed as they are in almost every kingdom in europe the supreme power in america cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword because the whole body of the people are armed and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops that can be on any pretense raised in the united states a military force at the command of congress can execute no laws but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional for they will possess the power and jealousy will instantly inspire the inclination to resist the execution of a law which appears to them unjust and oppressive
323481 that the said constitution shall never be construed to authorize congress to infringe the just liberty of the press or the rights of conscience or to prevent the people of the united states who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms
323482 one man with a gun can control 100 without one
323483 political power grows out of the barrel of a gun
323484 we dont let them have ideas why would we let them have guns
323485 the most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to allow the subject races to possess arms history shows that all conquerors who have allowed their subject races to carry arms have prepared their own downfall by doing so
323486 the peaceable part of mankind will be continually overrun by the vile and abandoned while they neglect the means of self defense weakness allures the ruffian but arms like laws discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe and preserve order in the world horrid mischief would ensue were the good deprived of the use of them the weak will become a prey to the strong
323487 admit it white racist man exy apartheid was your gift to dumbya wasnt it

323495 no one went to her lame ass blog to post anything except janny and if jannys slanders and troll comments are all over her blog then put up a few or shut the fuck up
323496 obama doesnt have a shred of intelligence neither do you
323497 one could listen to an irrelevant left wing dreamer like gnome chumpsky
323498 and perhaps win an all expenses paid trip to blow the exorcist
323499 or one could listen to the sage from south central speaking truth to power
323500 a prominent 20th century democrat made the following statement about the purpose of the second amendment
323501 the right of citizens to bear arms is just one guarantee against arbitrary government one more safeguard against the tyranny which now appears remote in america but which historically has proven to be always possible
323502 the supreme court in a 5 4 decision struck down the 1976 washington d c ban on handguns
323503 the court ruled that the founding fathers wanted the second amendment to allow individuals the right to keep and bear arms
323504 the minority disagreed arguing that the right only extends to those belonging to a state
323505 or did they define militia as something completely different a group of armed citizens with a right to

323509 the us and iraq are making progress towards forging a complex political and security agreement to allow us troops to operate legally in iraq next year iraqs foreign minister said yesterday
323510 one sticking point includes immunity for us troops which many iraqis would like to see lifted since the us led invasion in 2003 there have been several high profile cases of the killing torture and abuse of iraqis at the hands of american soldiers
323511 the iraqis are also demanding control over all detention centres

323524 when i mention the public i mean to include only the rational part of it the ignorant and vulgar are as unfit to judge of the modes of government as they are unable to manage its reins
323525 the people who own the country ought to govern it
323526 the constitution was intrinsically an aristocratic document designed to check the democratic tendencies of the period
323527 to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority

323540 we hate george w bush and all who support him
323541 ask anyone hear who ive asked to read chomsky during the past several years
323542 everyone is very happy to have this safely out of iraq
323543 we are pleased that we have taken the yellowcake from a volatile region into a stable area to produce clean electricity
323544 the big problem comes with any inhalation of any of the yellowcake dust
323545 as for guns being the way to respond to this thats outlandish first of all this is not a weak third world country if people have pistols the government has tanks if people get tanks the government has atomic weapons theres no way to deal with these issues by violent force even if you think that thats morally legitimate
323546 im sure the leftards will either a gt deny the yellowcake existed d gt
323547 later u n inspectors documented and safeguarded the yellowcake which had been stored in aging drums and containers since before the 1991 gulf war there was no evidence of any yellowcake dating from after 1991 the official said
323548 former ambassador joe wilson who wrote that he had found no evidence to support assertions that iraq tried to buy additional yellowcake from niger

323557 here is it is linked link to ban isps feel free to run your cursor over the address and then read it below
323558 why would i have that up unless i had linked to it myself
323559 how is it that i found it and you missed it
323560 and it has been proved that you harrassed one of your commenters
323561 you are grasping at straws and you are lying through your teeth
323562 i see kb has provided quotes by lenin stalin zedong etc that all have to do with guns
323563 well here is my quote on the topic of guns for you kb
323564 and how many ann coulter books did you say you have you read kb
323565 guns in the hands of american citizens are not going to make the country more

323571 hermann goering hitlers 2 man had this to say about war
323572 why of course the people dont want war why should some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor for that matter in germany that is understood but it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along to fight a war voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
323573 the function of propaganda does not lie in the scientific training of the individual but in calling the masses attention to certain facts processes and necessities whose significance is thus for the first time placed within their field of vision the whole art consists in doing this so skillfully that everyone will be convinced that the fact is real the process necessary the necessity correct
323574 calling the masses attention to certain facts processes and necessities whose significance is thus for the first time placed within their field of vision
323575 actually ive read everything ann coulter has written as well as rush and most any other drooler i can get ahold of why do you think i have the positions i do idiot oh and ive read all of william buckley jr s books too actually many of these folks but guess what im not going to sit here and say they did or didnt say things that they did or didnt say
323576 kb you can not talk about what they did or did not say because you have not read any of those books
323577 now its newport beach the never ending smell of tarmac and bubbling tar
323578 the function of propaganda does not lie in the scientific training of the individual but in calling the masses attention to certain facts processes and necessities whose significance is thus for the first time placed within their field of vision the whole art consists in doing this so skillfully that everyone will be convinced that the fact is real the process necessary the necessity correct
323579 will the left finally give up and admit weapons of mass destruction were found in iraq

323584 how is it possible to miss 550 metrtic tons of it
323585 the more i analyze kb behavior the more i think this person is really not normal
323586 either he she is high on some strong drug when he posts some comments so the next day he she does not even remember or he she has mental problems that keep him from remembering
323587 or it is simply a typical leftist without a conscience without integrity or honesty
323588 who says one thing then says the opposite of it
323589 you know kind of like kerry and obama do every week
323590 well theres making money off democrats and spending it here in paradise
323591 mocking left wing morons who read gnome chumpsky coloring books

323597 as if the right gives one small piece of a rats ass about american workers
323598 no one better claim the six hundred sixty sixth comment
323599 only a deranged person can link the love of fast american cars to torturing prisoners
323600 either you are with us or you are with the terrorists
323601 no one better claim the six hundred sixty sixth comment
323602 no one better claim the six hundred sixty sixth comment
323603 the illustration shows the typical irish chieftain eating out of doors with very rough and ready table manners
323604 at first sight the source presents a horrific scene we can see priests and bishops being tortured and killed for their faith notice however the calm expressions of the dead and tortured priests and the cruelty of the english soldiers this is a sure sign that this print has been created as propaganda and historians must be careful how they use it
323605 good one irish now maybe you can quit hiding behind b4es handle like you have with so many others
323606 actually im one of the handles s hes never hijacked but thats probably because of
323607 do you know what 13 000 will buy you in us military landing launching gear
323608 those numbers may seem small but military items can sell for pennies on the dollar compared with what the pentagon paid
323609 kb you would not understand about american made fast cars that are pretty much the only true viril manly testosterone loaded fast cars around because you are some kind of effeminate leftist or a woman who knows
323610 id rather drive a 150 000 brutish saleen mustang than a one million or two euro effeminate fragile piece of jewellry such as a mclaren
323611 i could man handle the mustang all day until the tires would be completely worned out
323612 and the mustang would almost be begging me to man handle it some more
323613 but the mclaren would break down after a couple hours like a delicate woman who just broke a nail and will not play anymore
323614 kb made me quit the republican party ans learn to read
323615 i know this must be chinese to you or greek
323616 but what the hell i have time on my hands
323617 only a deranged person can link the love of fast american cars to torturing prisoners
323618 and only a deranged person can ignore the utterly radically extreme supreme lack of manliness in people strapping bombs to mentally retarded people and sending them into a crowd such as al qaeda has done at least two times recently
323619 anyone who wants to kill innocent to get at the us or at israel you love
323620 you love monsters as long as they hate the same people you hate
323621 the more i have these weird exchanges with you the more sane i know i am
323622 oh by the way my girlfriend loves it that i am manly
323623 you know kind of like you feel when you look at a noam chomsky photo
323624 the poor deserve to die because god made them poor in the first place
323625 screw the environment cut down all trees kill all the whales uhhh just kill everything
323626 the illustration shows the typical irish chieftain eating out of doors with very rough and ready table manners
323627 at first sight the source presents a horrific scene we can see priests and bishops being tortured and killed for their faith notice however the calm expressions of the dead and tortured priests and the cruelty of the english soldiers this is a sure sign that this print has been created as propaganda and historians must be careful how they use it
323628 well heres the thing i just didnt have time to make it over to my usual coffee place you know the one way over on 2nd ave yeah its one of the last mom and pop coffee shops in the area i toooootally love that place its so real i was on my way over there but the traffic was a killer so i was totally forced to get my fix at this place i mean the rich get richer right thats the law of the land i totally cant stand that i have to come here but thats what they do they tie your hands man these big corporations they just own you theyre everywhere can you hand me one of those splenda
323629 the irish massacred protestants therefore ireland is a genocide nation
323630 you are in a different time zone and mc isnt
323631 looks like mandy is now running from the chomsky dicussion on the obama thread whoda guessed
323632 the irish massacred protestants therefore ireland is a genocide nation
323633 looks like mandy is now running from the chomsky dicussion on the obama thread whoda guessed
323634 looks like mandy is now running from the chomsky dicussion on the obama thread
323635 but actually i think this is a good sign from ic mandrool
323636 its a sign that a i havent had much free time lately
323637 and b you not only repeat the same tired predictable arguments over and over
323638 that its actually physically tiring reading and responding to your posts
323639 if someone gets tired after shoveling through a lot of shit it doesnt mean the shit is any less shitty just that theres more of it
323640 i dont need to eat an entire pile of shot to know that it tastes bad after a few nibbles
323641 you planning to post a comparitive iq figure any time
323642 were he to keep on and on as he actually did do for much too long this would be a sign of a much greater problem
323643 insisting on holding chomsky to minimal academic standards represents what kind of problem exactly
323644 now of course we would never in a million years get a confession from him that yes he did make several big mistakes
323645 as we did take the time to show him where he was off track
323646 as demanding a minimum in academic integrity from a supposedly vaunted commentator
323647 um in the evidence stakes i count me 1 you chomsky 0
323648 if you wanted to demonstrate otherwise why dont you get in touch with the original source of the material that was cited by ics source
323649 a either chomsky knew the source was shaky but included it anyway
323650 b chomsky didnt know the source was shaky indicating that he lacks the basic knowledge necessary to assess the accuracy of a source on an area that he is supposedly an expert in
323651 components of a generative grammar with various features of protein structures
323652 i must admit to taking a copy of noam chomskys syntactic structures along with me on my honeymoon in 1961 here was a marvelous thing a mathematical theory of language in which i could use a computer programmers intuition
323653 propaganda is to a democracy what the bludgeon is to a totalitarian state
323654 im happy to bust your and chomskys asses in any thread
323655 i will do so however when i have the time and inclination
323656 objection your honour the witness has no evidence on which to base that question 111
323657 but youve tried to argue an issue in serious terms
323658 the first filter ownership notes that most major media outlets are owned by large corporations
323659 the second funding notes that the outlets derive the majority of their funding from advertising not readers
323660 unfortunately our boy seems to have failed to spot the most basic economic principle governing media
323661 that being that advertisement comes to media because of readership numbers
323662 thus since they are profit oriented businesses selling a product readers and audiences to other businesses advertisers the model would expect them to publish news which would reflect the desires and values of those businesses
323663 then the model would be wrong since that is not what occurs in media at all
323664 the threat of a major advertiser pulling out may very very occasionally have an effect on media content but 99
323665 advertising gravitates to media based on readership numbers and demographics
323666 in addition the news media are dependent on government institutions and major businesses with strong biases as sources the third filter for much of their information
323667 sure as well as environmental groups and social activist groups of every stripe
323668 not to mention the ingrained liberal leaning tendencies of almost everyone in the news business which give them a profound distrust of both governments and business nor the journalistic principle of playing devils advocate
323669 flak the fourth filter refers to the various pressure groups which attack the media for supposed bias
323670 norms the fifth filter refer to the common conceptions shared by those in the profession of journalism
323671 opinions represented in the media normally belong to people with influence enough that their opinions matter except of course for the large number of public opinion polls that are either run in house by media outlers or run by polling organizations and reported by media outlets and other such forms of public discourse within the media such as opinion pages editorials letters to the editor etc shock horror give this man a medal for pointing out in general terms what everyone already knows but somehow trying to make it sound sinister 111
323672 see the dot and squiggly line after the last word in the sentence
323673 makes me wonder how youd do in a court room
323674 objection your honour the witness has no evidence on which to base that question 111
323675 so if the advertisers drive the financing of publishing and not the readership why was the nyt in a snit a couple of years ago when their subscription rates plunged
323676 their readership started dropping because of the editorial attitude of the times in addition to their gross neglect in regard to fact checking their asses
323677 once again krappinghisbeard misses the point except for the one on his head
323678 if i have told you once chomksy i have told you a million times not to exaggerate
323679 gee i guess that only in the mind of kb can the source for the story
323680 add to it the fact that theres no real evidence of such basing agreements occurring
323681 also add to it the fact that turkey actually flies cap missions to ward off iaf planes example the iaf hit the syrian facility some months back and the turks scrambled fighters to intercept
323682 but given all that evidence against it happening kb still believes in his pseudo god chomsky
323683 to indicate the strong security relationship that existed between turkey and israel
323684 the first filter ownership notes that most major media outlets are owned by large corporations
323685 the second funding notes that the outlets derive the majority of their funding from advertising not readers
323686 unfortunately our boy seems to have failed to spot the most basic economic principle governing media

323695 flak the fourth filter refers to the various pressure groups which attack the media for supposed bias
323696 norms the fifth filter refer to the common conceptions shared by those in the profession of journalism
323697 dear mister chomsky please tell me how to do my job in accordance with your principles i will pass the glorious message on to all my colleagues
323698 opinions represented in the media normally belong to people with influence enough that their opinions matter except of course for the large number of public opinion polls that are either run in house by media outlers or run by polling organizations and reported by media outlets and other such forms of public discourse within the media such as opinion pages editorials letters to the editor etc shock horror give this man a medal for pointing out in general terms what everyone already knows but somehow trying to make it sound sinister 111
323699 see the dot and squiggly line after the last word in the sentence
323700 makes me wonder how youd do in a court room
323701 objection your honour the witness has no evidence on which to base that question 111
323702 uh krappinghisbeard i was not quoting chomsky do not make that mistake again
323703 i made no reference to him whatsoever regarding the question
323704 because i consider chomskys take on it to be irrelevant
323705 since i dont need him to tell me what to think
323706 the reason for that was because the news stories i read online regarding the declining readership of the times had nothing whatsoever to do with chomsky and did not quote him at all
323707 i seriously doubt that i would ever agree with anything the intellectual from mit has written
323708 i read one of his books a long time ago in a college far far away
323709 i put the title up here and megatwat just about convinced me she was you in her crusade to discover which one
323710 treat that post with the title in it as an episode of the x files the truth is out there
323711 if he ever read chomsky i dont believe he understood a word of it
323712 anyone who changes the whole meaning of an article by changing non nuclear to nuclear and then says
323713 the trouble with you though is you dont think and you dont believe unless it is something bad about the us
323714 do cite those five references about the alleged koran abuse at gitmo the ones without retractions
323715 remember it also has to have massive purges of the population to keep them under control
323716 a secret police that breaks and enters without due process into the homes of the resident citizens and no accountability for same
323717 the meaning of the article was not changed by my use of the phrase test nukes it may have changed for you but i want to see ritoing and death because of it dickhead
323718 out of lurk mode it seems that the sockpuppets inmates are attempting to run the asylum now we have idiot irish who is coming up here to make a non sequitur point about chomsky
323719 why are you bringing that topic here instead of the thread below are you getting beaten in a debate again
323720 seems like that is all you socks do is run around from thread to thread trying to get the last word in accusing the regulars of running away and name calling
323721 gee i guess that only in the mind of kb can the source for the story say the numbers are bogus exact quote highly exaggerated add to it the fact that theres no real evidence of such basing agreements occurring also add to it the fact that turkey actually flies cap missions to ward off iaf planes example the iaf hit the syrian facility some months back and the turks scrambled fighters to intercept but given all that evidence against it happening kb still believes in his pseudo god chomsky
323722 oh wait i missed the word highly in regard to the exaggeration
323723 12 being highly exaggerated would meant that 12 didnt exist at all
323724 i am still asking the same questions oh krappinghisbeard is in japan sure
323725 um yeah except that it preceded a bunch of crap that i wrote myself from my own expertise well spotted
323726 the first filter ownership notes that most major media outlets are owned by large corporations
323727 which means what exactly does chomsky think its a secret that the media like every single other industry is larlgely comprised of large corporations
323728 the second funding notes that the outlets derive the majority of their funding from advertising not readers
323729 unfortunately our boy seems to have failed to spot the most basic economic principle governing media
323730 i wasnt going to go there but since i actually work in
323731 i mean hes only been studying this since before you were probably born
323732 and it took him that long to figure out that media outlets are mostly owned by large corporations and get most of their revenue from advertising
323733 and you really think chomsky has a better idea of what goes on in my job than i do
323734 he knows the term having been banned from michelle malkins site
323735 i think i would prefer hearing a dentists drill or looking at pictures of marilyn manson than to ever do that again
323736 if you are even remotely involved in media studies you have read manufacturing consent if you havent you probably should
323737 and you really think chomsky has a better idea of what goes on in my job than i do
323738 chomsky right others wrong read chomsky dont read horowitz people who dont read chomsky like guns and war and killing
323739 all i need to know about chomsky is that i was able to shred to pieces very easily what he said in a 1998 interview
323740 and i shredded to pieces both his predictions and his
323741 and all i need to know is that you kb were never able to do anything about it
323742 if you are incapable of producing a rebuttal to my destroying without effort a tiny 3 pages of chomsky
323743 what could you possibly do if i were to take apart one of his book
323744 i mean what could you do apart from calling me a drooler
323745 and claiming no leftist here ever said they cared about chomsky
323746 which is exactly what you did a couple months ago when i destroyed chomsky in the 1998 interview
323747 maybe some day you will snap out of it or maybe you will sink deeper
323748 if you were not delusional you would have done something a long time ago about my destroying chomsky in his 1998 interview
323749 and the fact you have only met 8 or 9 right wing people who have read chomsky
323750 only means that most right wing people know that they know chomsky writes bullshit
323751 i could read peter pan 50 times peter pan would still be a fictional character
323752 reading the bullshit of chomsky a hundred times will not make it anything else but bullshit
323753 the 1998 3 pages interview showed me chomsky is an idiot
323754 i do not need hundreds of pages more of idiocy to confirm it
323755 i never went to university english is not even my first language
323756 but i destroyed chomsky in that 1998 3 pages interview and you can not do a thing about it
323757 http www writesight com writers kb index php accomplishments my accomplishments n a lololz
323758 my obama who the hell would hire this idiot as a
323759 page after page of fake dialogues and chomsky man love
323760 as an actual writer ill let you in on a secret
323761 your entire page on writesight can be summed up as
323762 read chomsky dont read horowitz people who dont read chomsky like guns and war and killing
323763 your entire page on writesight can be summed up as
323764 read chomsky dont read horowitz people who dont read chomsky like guns and war and killing
323765 after a similar altercation said liberal actually attempted to track me down tried to post my personal details on a forum and threatened to contact my employer and try to mess with my career i dont trust you lefty psychos as far as i could throw you
323766 before unions before human rights courts and before leftists activism he was using thugs to intimidate people who stood in the way of his monopoly
323767 now try and justify why amnesty international is friendly with north korea to the point of denying human rights abuses
323768 after a similar altercation said liberal actually attempted to track me down tried to post my personal details on a forum and threatened to contact my employer and try to mess with my career i dont trust you lefty psychos as far as i could throw you
323769 and it took him that long to figure out that media outlets are mostly owned by large corporations and get most of their revenue from advertising
323770 that being that advertisement comes to media because of readership numbers
323771 omfobama wheres my evidence that content demographics and readership numbers are what generates interest from advertisors and thus ad revenue give me a break dude
323772 how do you know that chomsky doesnt already know this
323773 i can go on for days asking basic questions all of which could easily be answered were you to actually take the time to read a book or two but being that your indoctrination prohibits this well i guess well have to just stick with you reading a few lines pretending that you know the entire story
323774 or i could just use my professional knowledge to respond to the summary of chomskys argument that you posted
323775 thus since they are profit oriented businesses selling a product readers and audiences to other businesses advertisers the model would expect them to publish news which would reflect the desires and values of those businesses
323776 then the model would be wrong since that is not what occurs in media at all
323777 interesting your knowledge on the topic comes from where exactly
323778 but ill allow you the chance to try and provide some evidence for your assertions
323779 hm how about since mine is a professional opinion based on several years experience in the industry i ask you for some evidence that outweighs what i have to say
323780 and then ill allow you the opportunity to prove that chomsky thesis conflicts with this of course meaning that you will have to know his thesis to begin with and what its based on i
323781 you are claiming that the summation of his theory that you posted is inaccurate why did you post it then
323782 the threat of a major advertiser pulling out may very very occasionally have an effect on media content but 99
323783 this is a fact of the media industry chomsky who has never been a professional journalist to my knowledge can write as many books as he wants
323784 he should stick to the areas he knows about and leave the media to the professionals who know about it
323785 once you have read it and demonstrated you have understood the words then i may start listening to something you have to say
323786 ill be sure and tell the media industry that weve been doing our jobs wrong and that we should alter what we do to reflect chomskys version of reality
323787 advertising gravitates to media based on readership numbers and demographics
323788 except that he said media outlets could be expected to publish content that fits with advertisors wishes which implies the opposite take a look at cbs in the ed murrow era if you dont believe me
323789 he most likely is aware of this which makes him double full of crap
323790 in addition the news media are dependent on government institutions and major businesses with strong biases as sources the third filter for much of their information
323791 sure as well as environmental groups and social activist groups of every stripe
323792 so why does the summary of his theory fail to mention it
323793 hey i opened this book called the bible the other day and the first thing i saw was something about killing a bunch of people well i didnt really need to read any more to know what this book was all about
323794 not to mention the ingrained liberal leaning tendencies of almost everyone in the news business which give them a profound distrust of both governments and business nor the journalistic principle of playing devils advocate
323795 as for businesses how do you think the demonization of mining oil companies etc came about
323796 i pointed out that ic had put it on the line by posting his personal details here while kb and his allies ie yourselves hadnt done so
323797 i pointed out the hypocrisy in kbs words using ic as an example not myself
323798 im of course opposed to terror any rational person is but i think that if were serious about the question of terror and serious about the question of violence we have to recognize that it is a tactical and hence moral matter incidentally tactical issues are basically moral issues they have to do with human consequences and if were interested in lets say diminishing the amount of violence in the world its at least arguable and sometimes true that a terroristic act does diminish the amount of violence in the world hence a person who is opposed to violence will not be opposed to that terroristic act
323799 someone opposed to violence will not be opposed to that terrorist act
323800 and it took him that long to figure out that media outlets are mostly owned by large corporations and get most of their revenue from advertising
323801 im of course opposed to terror any rational person is but i think that if were serious about the question of terror and serious about the question of violence we have to recognize that it is a tactical and hence moral matter incidentally tactical issues are basically moral issues they have to do with human consequences and if were interested in lets say diminishing the amount of violence in the world its at least arguable and sometimes true that a terroristic act does diminish the amount of violence in the world hence a person who is opposed to violence will not be opposed to that terroristic act
323802 someone opposed to violence will not be opposed to that terrorist act
323803 ugh i can see im going to have to batter your head until it bursts like it did on the other thread
323804 til i can summon the willpower to care enough to do that ill take a look at a couple of points that struck me
323805 so rather than trying to make yourself out to be some sort of professional by boasting of your credientials
323806 how else would one make themselves out to be a professional
323807 because the vast majority the industry operates according to the free market principle
323808 excluding those entities that arent required to survive by making a profit on their own merits
323809 this is the same logic that said someone wouldnt be able to change the fact that slavery was legal and natural
323810 that was a moral judgement based in part on theories of genetics that have been scientifically disproven
323811 to change the way it works would require chomsky changing the human condition from what it is
323812 and if he succeeded hed have nothing left to write about
323813 it changed in russia cuba north korea and a few other places as well
323814 i can think of hundreds of examples like this and it was always posited that x wouldnt change that it was just
323815 please do explain how the media being governed by free market principles is analogous to maltreatment of other races based on the idea that such treatment is justified morally and genetically
323816 ugh i can see im going to have to batter your head until it bursts like it did on the other thread
323817 til i can summon the willpower to care enough to do that ill take a look at a couple of points that struck me
323818 so rather than trying to make yourself out to be some sort of professional by boasting of your credientials
323819 how else would one make themselves out to be a professional
323820 advertising gravitates to media due to readership numbers content and demographics there may be some cases where the threat of a major advertisor pulling the contract could conceivably have an effect on content but 99 9999 of the time its the other way around
323821 because the vast majority the industry operates according to the free market principle
323822 excluding those entities that arent required to survive by making a profit on their own merits
323823 this is the same logic that said someone wouldnt be able to change the fact that slavery was legal and natural
323824 that was a moral judgement based in part on theories of genetics that have been scientifically disproven
323825 to change the way it works would require chomsky changing the human condition from what it is
323826 and if he succeeded hed have nothing left to write about
323827 it changed in russia cuba north korea and a few other places as well
323828 i can think of hundreds of examples like this and it was always posited that x wouldnt change that it was just
323829 please do explain how the media being governed by free market principles is analogous to maltreatment of other races based on the idea that such treatment is justified morally and genetically
323830 another sign of indoctrination is how someone can see one group commit terror such as israeli bombings of refugeee camps killing dozens
323831 terrorism n the systematic use of violence to create a general climate of fear in a population and thereby to bring about a particular political objective
323832 taking out israels bomb making infrastructure or weapons caches including the nuclear weapons which they have illegally helicopters which you gave them and on and on
323833 a country where he wasnt born and has never lived
323834 and why is he so poor what with all that aid money
323835 is it perhaps because hamas used it all to buy explosives to strap onto his chest instead of using it for productive enterprize
323836 hey i have a swell idea ill just strap a vest on bombs around myself walk into a cafe and blow myself up its sure a nice day for it besides i dont even have a basketball
323837 the other one is a military operation sanctioned officially by a sovereign government
323838 the fact that the israeli army spends untold amounts on training and r amp d to ensure strikes are targeted and collateral damage is minimalized makes their operations the exact opposite of terror
323839 the minimal civilian casualties that occur are collateral and are squarely on the shoulders of hamas et als operatives for conducting operations within a civilian area
323840 ugh i can see im going to have to batter your head until it bursts like it did on the other thread
323841 which i guess was a reference to my insistence on
323842 its also earlier on in this thread where i pinned you for a three count on your supposition that i didnt understand your awful
323843 its also earlier on in this thread where i pinned you for a three count on your supposition that i didnt understand your awful
323844 another sign of indoctrination is how someone can see one group commit terror such as israeli bombings of refugeee camps killing dozens
323845 most people in the world dont agree with my view
323846 im of course opposed to terror any rational person is but i think that if were serious about the question of terror and serious about the question of violence we have to recognize that it is a tactical and hence moral matter incidentally tactical issues are basically moral issues they have to do with human consequences and if were interested in lets say diminishing the amount of violence in the world its at least arguable and sometimes true that a terroristic act does diminish the amount of violence in the world hence a person who is opposed to violence will not be opposed to that terroristic act
323847 terrorism n the systematic use of violence to create a general climate of fear in a population and thereby to bring about a particular political objective
323848 systematic uses of violence to create a general climate of fear in a population
323849 systematic violence to create a general climate of fear amongst a population for a political objective
323850 taking out israels bomb making infrastructure or weapons caches oh you mean the bomb making infrastructure and weapons caches located in the civilian town of sderot or in coffee shops bakeries and public busses you have just conclusively demonstrated that you are utterly ignorant about the entire conflict and that you are a dishonest fraud no one no single party whatsoever be it hamas israel or any other participant in the conflict makes the claim that hamas is attempting to strike israeli military infrastructure or any other kind of infrastructure palestinian attacks on israel specifically target people frequently idf personnel but most commonly civilians including the nuclear weapons which they have illegally this has not been proven but if the alleged nuclear weapons do actually exist they are the best thing that ever happened to you lying liberals without the supposed israeli nuclear weapons you wouldnt have the tenuous justification you have for supporting irans nuclear weapon program which would make it that much harder to conceal your dream of israels destruction under the blanket of false humanitarian concern and respect for international law two things that are conspicuously lacking from your list of priorities when you dont need them to try and condemn israel or the u s helicopters which you gave them given that im not american and have never paid a dime in american taxes and given that you are american and presumably have had some input to the economy there at some point if anyone has given israel helicopters its you not me how does that taste and on and on
323851 a country where he wasnt born and has never lived
323852 and why is he so poor what with all that aid money
323853 is it perhaps because hamas used it all to buy explosives to strap onto his chest instead of using it for productive enterprize
323854 hey i have a swell idea ill just strap a vest on bombs around myself walk into a cafe and blow myself up its sure a nice day for it besides i dont even have a basketball
323855 the other one is a military operation sanctioned officially by a sovereign government
323856 the fact that the israeli army spends untold amounts on training and r amp d to ensure strikes are targeted and collateral damage is minimalized makes their operations the exact opposite of terror
323857 the minimal civilian casualties that occur are collateral and are squarely on the shoulders of hamas et als operatives for conducting operations within a civilian area
323858 til i can summon the willpower to care enough to do that ill take a look at a couple of points that struck me
323859 it sorta seems that you could have just read forward slightly and seen what they were
323860 the exact points which one should be looking at are shelved and instead talking about something like my typos becomes an
323861 only became an issue because you cast aspersions on others literacy
323862 and dont try to imply that i focussed on your typos in lieu of answering your other points cos we both know that isnt the case
323863 so rather than trying to make yourself out to be some sort of professional by boasting of your credientials
323864 how else would one make themselves out to be a professional
323865 the credentials of a professional or one who makes his living in a
323866 i am unsure how to simplify this further so that you would understand it
323867 this makes me a professional as opposed to someone who for example writes editorials but generates the majority of their income from other means who would not be defined as a
323868 i am unsure why you have such difficulty grasping this concept
323869 im interested in what youre planning to say do arguements you may make evidence you provide etc
323870 i dont need to provide evidence that i am a media professional
323871 i do not intend in the least to further clarify the area of my work on a public internet forum
323872 im the professional here so you should on faith believe what i say
323873 actually to support your contention that others are illiterate you might have chosen to say
323874 i do hope that youre going to get to something relevant
323875 as you had been casting aspersions on others literacy while making abysmal syntax errors in your own writing
323876 your credentials are not the subject and they contain no arguments
323877 i was not claiming that they were you are the one who made my credentials the centre of focus not me
323878 i didnt even mention them when i first argued against chomskys contentions regarding media
323879 or were you wishing to try and argue that we should listen to what you have to say over chomsky because of your supposed profession regardless that theres nothing so far which would even make a rational person even think of doing so
323880 i mean lets look at how things stand at this point
323881 how does this affect the free market nature of media and advertising
323882 hes asked to speak in departments ranging from computer science cognitive science mathematics psychology linguistics of course economics social science politics to name a few
323883 how does this affect the free market nature of media and advertising
323884 he has credentials for whatever theyre worth from all over the place
323885 how does this affect the free market nature of media and advertising
323886 you have written nothing that we know of which is rather odd given that you arere trying to tout your profession as something we need to consider while not telling us what youve done
323887 youd have a hard time knowing what ive written or what i havent written given that you dont even know my name let alone what i write about
323888 we dont know if youre a journalist which for goddesss sake i hope not or a ceo or murdoch himself or a janitor at the local paper office or what
323889 according to you this shouldnt matter because one shouldnt listen to others merely because of their credentials
323890 you have presented exactly nothing here which would indicate that you are anything at all in the
323891 you have given a few opinions sort of like i can read on the bathroom walls at any i 44 truckstop
323892 if you can find something right about launching rockets full of poisoned shrapnel into civilian areas in a neighbouring country from civilian areas within ones own country or convincing young men that strapping explosives onto their chest and detonating them in crowded civilian areas will earn them a ticket to paradise in the afterlife please let me know
323893 i challenged the synopsis of his views on media that you personally posted here
323894 but as ive been trying to do since day one on this blog it would be great if you would actually read a couple of his books yourself
323895 how many years have you spent trying to do this
323896 not cherry picking from anti chomsky drool site all of which im familiar with and make your own arguments
323897 all the arguments ive made against chomskys work have been my own besides ics contact with his source and the president truman speech
323898 in this day and age it is difficult to know where to hang ones hat
323899 i find it amazing how difficult this is for you folks
323900 what on earth does bravery have to do with anything why would you think the reason we dont read chomsky is due to fear
323901 you think im afraid to read chomskys books on media
323902 get a grip dude i dont read them because im not interested in them
323903 because the vast majority the industry operates according to the free market principle
323904 again why the comparison between a free media market and slavery
323905 why even mention the two things in the same sentence
323906 excluding those entities that arent required to survive by making a profit on their own merits
323907 you asked me why chomsky isnt going to change the way media works i answered you
323908 this just reminded me something funny from feelthehate above when he mentioned chomskys
323909 that was a moral judgement based in part on theories of genetics that have been scientifically disproven
323910 it had existed for thousands of years it was defended by every imaginable method and most all had to do with economics
323911 well it was fought against over turned and we grew out of it kb
323912 it was fought against and overturned because it was a system that victimized people
323913 removed their freedom and forced them to work in harsh conditions with little or no compensation and justified doing so by theories on genetics that are incorrect
323914 the fact that media run advertisements to generate revenue is not in the remotest way similar to this
323915 this is the comparison regardless of the institution in question
323916 the comparison between slavery and advertising is relevant because one system was overturned due to its subjugation of human rights while the other one has not been and will not be overturned because there is nothing inherently wrong with it and it is an organic economic system that victimizes no one but benefits many
323917 that being said i would think it would be much easier to change the economic system than slavery
323918 sigh maybe i need to put things in a slightly simpler fashion so you can grasp them
323919 slavery was not justified on economic grounds it was justified on the grounds that people of certain races were deemed to be inferior and thus fit for the role of slave
323920 right which is why britain has such great health care
323921 to change the way it works would require chomsky changing the human condition from what it is
323922 free market principles exist because there is no pre existing external economic structure
323923 capitalism has improved the lives of more people than any other system besides religion
323924 and would have appauled adam smith who thought the free market would lead to equality
323925 actually i believe adam smith that prosperity could be gained by competition and rational self interest
323926 and if he succeeded hed have nothing left to write about
323927 it changed in russia cuba north korea and a few other places as well
323928 other than causing a high percentage of russians to long for the days when stalin was in charge saying those were the best years of their lives
323929 presumably not the ones who were sent to the gulags or the ones in the satellites who were starved to death and so on
323930 the personality cult does not allow the russian common people and the elite to take an honest look at the history of their nation and give stalin credit for turning the ussr into a superpower of the 20th century
323931 go figure anyway why are you talking about these countries there arent relevant to what we do in the u s kb
323932 they are demonstrations of what happens when the free market is done away with
323933 the terror of a trade embargo that is full of holes anyway
323934 heres an idea why not pay those billions out of castros estate
323935 you know since his 50 year dictatorship is the sole reason for cuban suffering and poverty while the u
323936 kb has a masters in clinical psychology but doesnt practice
323937 after reading his gobshite here why does that not surprise me i am amazed that i ever supported him or thought he was intelligent
323938 i am amazed that i ever supported kb or thought he was intelligent
323939 the second strategic dialogue between israel and turkey is currently being held in israel 3 6 5 97 this meeting follows the first dialogue held in ankara turkey the strategic dialogue represents an additional foundation in the process of deepening defense and military relations between israel and turkey it was preceded by a series of visits and defense related meetings which led to a mutual agreement on aerial training a joint training program visits and military activities an industrial agreement and a series of projects and contacts in the sphere of foreign defense assistance
323940 turkey israel relations date to march 28 1949 when turkey became the first country with a muslim majority to formally recognize the state of israel
323941 if you can find something right about launching rockets full of poisoned shrapnel into civilian areas in a neighbouring country from civilian areas within ones own country or convincing young men that strapping explosives onto their chest and detonating them in crowded civilian areas will earn them a ticket to paradise in the afterlife please let me know
323942 the terror of a trade embargo that is full of holes anyway
323943 heres an idea why not pay those billions out of castros estate
323944 duh conservatives like capitalism and free markets duh that means they like rich people duh that means they dont care about all da poor people duh that means if someone has lots of money the conservatives must like him duhhhhh
323945 the terror of a trade embargo that is full of holes anyway
323946 other than causing a high percentage of russians to long for the days when stalin was in charge saying those were the best years of their lives
323947 presumably not the ones who were sent to the gulags or the ones in the satellites who were starved to death and so on
323948 ugh i can see im going to have to batter your head until it bursts like it did on the other thread
323949 which i guess was a reference to my insistence on
323950 its also earlier on in this thread where i pinned you for a three count on your supposition that i didnt understand your awful

323958 what on earth does bravery have to do with anything why would you think the reason we dont read chomsky is due to fear
323959 for every five tons bought from foreign producers one campesino becomes a candidate for migration
323960 i wasnt planning on coming back to this but you should know that it was i who said i was tired of your nit picking and that nobody had ever proved that 12 of the iaf were never in turkey
323961 it was not kb who talked of nit picking and said he was leaving the discussion
323962 and its not up to kb to back up chomsky anyway it was ic who challenged the statement in the first place and it was therefore he who needed to find concrete back up which he never got other than an opinion expressed in retrospect by olsen
323963 the more you make incorrect assumptions the dumber you look
323964 i wasnt planning on coming back to this but you should know that it was i who said i was tired of your nit picking and that nobody had ever proved that 12 of the iaf were never in turkey
323965 the more you make incorrect assumptions the dumber you look
323966 heres an idea why not pay those billions out of castros estate
323967 but even if he did why would this bother you
323968 i see you had some problem addressing the first half of my post mandy
323969 the problem was that it bored me into a coma
323970 since you werent involved in the discussion in the first place i must have missed the tag and assumed it was kb posting
323971 would wonder what made you get involved in it just to say you didnt want to be involved
323972 but then you libs are all here on a site you apparently despise so im damned if im going to put any more thought into what your major malfunction is
323973 my point stands anyway since kb has cut out of the discussion
323974 and moved onto bashing the jooooooooz around these parts instead
323975 and whoever said it was categorically denied apparently you missed the entire point of the debate woops
323976 and its not up to kb to back up chomsky anyway
323977 yeah i think it is since he keeps bringing chomsky up
323978 it was ic who challenged the statement in the first place and it was therefore he who needed to find concrete back up
323979 he thought the number was suspect he contacted the source the source said he also thought it was suspect
323980 to indicate the strong security relationship that existed between turkey and israel
323981 constituting expert backing for ics contention that the number was shaky
323982 see now why i didnt bother replying the first time around
323983 oh rly i wonder where these journalists were in the debate on media and advertising relations above
323984 the more you make incorrect assumptions the dumber you look keep right on doing it i say
323985 plenty of nit picky teacher types too you and your mates being exhibit a

324002 the more you make incorrect assumptions the dumber you look keep right on doing it i say
324003 plenty of nit picky teacher types too you and your mates being exhibit a
324004 youre definitely not involved in media except as the parking attendant at a news stand
324005 ive expressed support for communists nowhere on this blog find some quote of mine if you can but i guarantee you wont
324006 and starts taking from everyone and giving little in return
324007 using the resources to consolidate his own power instead of delivering on any of the things he promised its still the eeeevil capitalists who are to blame
324008 ditto chavez one supposes who is already going down the castro path
324009 nationalizing the oil industry and repressing student protests against him
324010 and so forth never mind that hes managed to engineer food shortages in an opec country during the highest period of oil prices ever and the better off half of his population is fleeing to panama while they still can
324011 im sure its still the us of kkkas fault somehow even though they havent conducted any military action against him
324012 you lap up every scrap of propaganda that falls from the tables of people like hamas and castro like its gospel truth
324013 no no no its not me you are the indoctrinated one
324014 thats what these poor vietnamese need to cheer themselves up
324015 i dont need proof to execute a man i only need proof that its necessary to execute him
324016 castro is a mass murdering dictator who lied to the cubans and took advantage of their naivete to enslave them in misery for the next fifty years
324017 oh the israelis provoked them with their terrorism that they use to expand their land
324018 its okay all those people castro was killing were criminals and he only needed to do it to free the cubans
324019 and starts taking from everyone and giving little in return
324020 using the resources to consolidate his own power instead of delivering on any of the things he promised its still the eeeevil capitalists who are to blame
324021 ditto chavez one supposes who is already going down the castro path

324025 you lap up every scrap of propaganda that falls from the tables of people like hamas and castro like its gospel truth
324026 no no no its not me you are the indoctrinated one
324027 a war crimes investigator who examined the evidence without prompting of any kind offered his opinion that it suggested a friendly fire incident of some kind

324036 and then theres the little matter of what the usa was is doing in that country in the first place
324037 under a communist form of central government leaving the system is discouraged which is why the iron curtain was mined on the east side to keep people in
324038 its also why cuba kills refugees trying to get to the states
324039 not worth wasting your breath on those damn criminal cubans
324040 questioning some kid for blowing an amerikkkans head off with a grenade though is another story
324041 now thats a moral issue us progressives can get worked up about 11
324042 ja because they achieved sooo much freedom for the cubans
324043 the freedom to agree with unka castro on everything or else get beaten or killed
324044 guywhosupposedly works in the media but knows less than the average fox viewer
324045 under a communist form of central government leaving the system is discouraged which is why the iron curtain was mined on the east side to keep people in
324046 its also why cuba kills refugees trying to get to the states
324047 not worth wasting your breath on those damn criminal cubans
324048 questioning some kid for blowing an amerikkkans head off with a grenade though is another story
324049 now thats a moral issue us progressives can get worked up about 11
324050 ja because they achieved sooo much freedom for the cubans
324051 the more powerful richer more advanced country is always wrong
324052 even though they are pretty much worthless except as a way to make a point
324053 the freedom to agree with unka castro on everything or else get beaten or killed
324054 castro was popular fifty years ago before he enslaved the entire country the us is to blame
324055 as for calgary herald his defence team are going to claim hes innocent who knew
324056 the freedom to disappear without trace and never be seen again
324057 the freedom to be left to die in a pool of your own waste if you manage to get into one of the
324058 because you know now everyone is miserable because you know the fact that some people were miserable before was
324059 you know not related to you know the fact that others were making more money because you know class envy is just a lowest common denominator excuse to rouse the you know rabble
324060 you mean turning an entire country into a giant prison camp in the name of
324061 of course a continuation of support for our criminal for eternity would have been just fine for you
324062 not really probably would have been better for most cubans though
324063 the covert war was launched after the sandinista revolution took control in nicaragua
324064 essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of the united states as determined by the united states
324065 significantly higher than the number of us persons killed in the us civil war and all the wars of the 20th century combined
324066 limited top down forms of democratic change that did not risk upsetting the traditional structures of power with which the united states has long been allied
324067 the feeling of superiority that my moral equivalency gives me
324068 and then hold them in misery and slavery for the next fifty years
324069 castro told them nothing that they werent already aware of
324070 even more impressive is tying someone to a tree and shooting their face off with a rifle
324071 and what makes it even more impressive is that he was of the more fortunate folks who could have had a pretty cushy life had he fewer morals
324072 shooting your political opposition or even people who you think might not like you then spending the next 50 years ruling with an iron fist and shooting escapees from your prison state is a moral imperative now
324073 communist lies about equality and freedom took in a lot of people instead of just a few who knew
324074 odd that you folks just sort of whisk over the most obvious parts such as this
324075 odd that you folks just sort of whisk sic over the fact that for all castros starry eyed promises he simply did what every other
324076 your entire narrative simply leaves out the reason castro came into being in the first place
324077 yeah why do these pure of heart progressive socially minded types become attracted to immense riches and power that makes them practically untouchable
324078 you mean like why israel has a strong military possibly retains a nuclear arsenal and is still partly outside its 1967 borders
324079 panoramic view of the cuban memorial miami each cross holds one victim of fidel castros regime over ten thousands crosses covered the field
324080 me dont want usa to hurt the poor iraqis make the scary men with the guns go away wah wah wah
324081 the freedom to disappear without trace and never be seen again
324082 the freedom to be left to die in a pool of your own waste if you manage to get into one of the

324087 not really probably would have been better for most cubans though
324088 the covert war was launched after the sandinista revolution took control in nicaragua washingtons professed fear was that a second cuba might develop in this central american nation

324116 the perception among the american public and even among lawmakers is that the people who are being deported are maniacal homicidal and rapist criminals

324133 camera performance was mixed the f100fd is slow to start up making you wait around 2 5 seconds before you can take a photo the camera does focus quickly though even in low light situations i didnt find shutter lag to be a problem
324134 the fujifilm finepix f100fd is a good overall performer color and exposure were both good and helpful automatic tools like face detection dynamic range and the preset scene modes proved useful and responsive to a variety of situations
324135 color and image quality is first rate and while the f100fd may perform a bit better with higher contrast images than earlier models thats not the only reason to consider the fuji in fact id rate it as one of the less compelling reasons good shutter performance stabilization that 28mm wide angle lens still the best high iso performance ive come across in current production point and shoot
324136 the image quality both indoors and out is excellent with vivid natural colors with a msrp of us 299 95 this camera would be a great choice for anyone looking for a mega zoom model that doesnt mind the small burst modes
324137 how the heck are you going to build an economy or a business only if the sun is shining

324225 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck rick davis mr
324226 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me mr
324227 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
324228 hes not from central casting when it comes to candidates for president of the united states hes new to washington yes hes african american
324229 hes too new and he needs to put some meat on his bones

324232 probably want someone who takes care of his health as an example of the kind of personal discipline necessary to do the job
324233 sometimes its hard to tell if barack obama is running for president of the united states or mr universe
324234 only celebrities like barack obama go to the gym three times a day
324235 is engaging in the same old negative politics of karl rove
324236 somebody get a f ing corn dog in his hand now

324242 sometimes as many as 30 speeches in an olympic year
324243 it is those moments that you should value that should motivate you to sit down and figure out how can this inspire me to do better
324244 i can use my own story share my own ouchie moment to show kids that they are not failures they just need to be motivated to set goals and pursue their dreams
324245 i believe strongly in the ideals of the olympic movement
324246 there are plenty of events within the sport that are better competitions for horse jumping but the olympics is more than just about the competition
324247 its a chance for the world to come together through sport
324248 people came into those games saying they were the best ever
324249 they left because of that saying they were the worst it was tragic in every way
324250 i remember those opening ceremonies and when we entered that stadium it shook with applause
324251 i remember thinking in two weeks im going to have to ride in the center of this field it was an amazing feeling
324252 my olympic experience will always stand out not because of the competition but for the incredible experience of being part of something so great
324253 wearing that usa jersey on my back and winning for my country is still one of the most joyous moments of my life
324254 we really gelled as a team in those months leading up to the olympics
324255 we knew each other well by then and we all had that one purpose to win gold
324256 its kind of like a golfer leading the pack heading into the last sunday of a major competition
324257 its where you want to be but you cant sleep much
324258 i remember that long plane ride home when it really sank in what we had accomplished
324259 with my daughters now i enjoy watching the womens sports a lot and seeing how they are inspired
324260 a mid ranking al qaeda operative believed to be either egyptian or jordanian
324261 the channel also interviewed an official from the pakistani armys inter services public relations directorate who said the military was aware of the incident but could not confirm the report
324262 but we stay together and thats what makes unwanted boundary crossings by south american and african bishops so confusing
324263 cant a baptized person get into heaven without you making him a bishop for awhile
324264 we seem to arrived at a special level of trust
324265 seek ye first the kingdom of god and all these things will be added unto you
324266 rule number two if your jeweler sizes your ring it should fit you perfectly for the rest of your life whether you bought it from them or not
324267 rule number three if your jewelry ever becomes slightly discolored for whatever reason or makes a mark on your skin and or clothing accuse your jeweler of using inferior metal or even of not using precious metal at all explain in as loud a voice as possible that you saw a show on tv or read an article in wealthy people quarterly
324268 if all other rules fail and you cannot get your new piece of jewelry for free accuse the jeweler of switching your diamond
324269 if you use these rules you may not be able to get everything you want but you will certainly get more than you could if you just walk in like a sap and act in a reasonable manner remember that your jeweler just like everyone else is really only out to rip you off so you must beat them to the punch the biggest and most powerful secret of all is that they just hate for anyone to be unhappy with anything they do and will do practically anything to make you happy especially when they find out just how rich you are and how smart you are about all of this jewelry stuff and if they think you might tell your friends that they tried to rip you off this weakness will actually keep some of them from sleeping at night use this valuable information to your advantage and get that jewelry work done for free
324270 why are you selling them pieces that they cant sell you should know your customer better
324271 perverse has a beautiful beautiful box cover amazing shot of sunrise this is vivids ninth release on blu ray and numbers have been consistent

324273 its still nowhere near the end of the season and that sort of stuff so itd be good to get the win and maybe a little bit of breathing space from other teams but if you win or lose youve still got to do it around semi finals time
324274 the storm are a top team and i reckon theyre still the bench mark and right across the park
324275 its going to be a big game i think theres been a lot of talk on the northern beaches about it and hopefully theres a big crowd out there next week
324276 hopefully we can get a little bit of a roll on going into the semis and cause a bit of havoc
324277 its just an ongoing thing 90 per cent of the blokes out there are running around with niggles
324278 at times you get a bit sore and you tweak it but its something ive learned to manage
324279 yes i spend a lot of time at my bench is there any one piece i could show you or tell you about
324280 mom is this all the jewelry you were talking about why dont you buy those pieces you liked
324281 most of your things have sold but perhaps we can work out a credit for them toward some new pieces
324282 yeah right in your world maybe but here on earth my customers would laugh at me if i quoted that much
324283 you are the all blacks the absolute pride of our nation the best in the world

324291 i have had so many mostly estate agents from austria neighbouring bavaria and germany
324292 we manage most of the austrian lakes so by principle were interested in taking over the mondsee
324293 we recently made an alternative offer to mrs waechter well manage the lake for her for free for two years during which she will continue to receive revenues from it and then well make an offer to buy
324294 weve seen record growth in the number of solar rebate applications lodged since the government acted on budget night to better target the rebate to those earning less than 100 000
324295 an average of 522 applications have been lodged weekly since the budget with 794 in one week alone
324296 this confirms that the government took the right step in bringing funds forward for this program and ensuring that they go to those australian families that most need financial assistance to install solar systems in their homes
324297 i call on the state government to uphold the inherent social justice philosophy of the labor party and purchase homes from those people in our community who are suffering with this burden financially and mentally
324298 this matter is not about economics it is about humanity
324299 people in this community rightfully feel let down by their own government
324300 these are hard working australians who have paid taxes all their working lives are they now to be abandoned by their own government
324301 this community is hurting and we must all work together to ease peoples pain and concerns

324307 its a good time for us to step up to the mark
324308 were playing at home on a sunday afternoon it will be conducive to good footy which the boys are excited about and were playing a team that has got a lot of football in them
324309 i think you going to see a really good open brand of football
324310 i think wayne bennett has thrown out that little bit of a challenge for him with colin going really well
324311 the boys are starting to warm to the task a little bit and ive seen a change to their attitude since the third origin
324312 it shall be known that in 2008 the world will be blessed
324313 barack obama may be the one but is he ready to lead
324314 senator mccain can keep telling everyone how proud he is of these political stunts which even his republican friends and advisors have called childish but barack obama will continue talking about his plan to jumpstart our economy by giving working families 1 000 us dollars of immediate relief
324315 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
324316 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
324317 excuse me young man this is going to be a question and answer session so you can ask a question later
324318 why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african american community or black community in this country

324320 every issue that youve spoken about i actually did speak out of
324321 what i said was what i think everybody knows which is that i dont look like i came out of central casting when it comes to presidential candidates

324388 weve seen record growth in the number of solar rebate applications lodged since the government acted on budget night to better target the rebate to those earning less than 100 000
324389 an average of 522 applications have been lodged weekly since the budget with 794 in one week alone
324390 this confirms that the government took the right step in bringing funds forward for this program and ensuring that they go to those australian families that most need financial assistance to install solar systems in their homes

324396 i dont think theres going to be enough jumpsuits for everyone in the school
324397 by calling work coveralls a prison outfit i think is rather insulting to all those people that work out in the economy every day in some kind of business that requires them because of the nature of their work to wear a coverall
324398 public school dress codes should be limited to whats necessary to guard against actual disruption to the educational process and threats to safety

324422 hes been working at it and hes getting better but hes still a long way from being that shortstop that can go to his left and to his right
324423 basically we talked to him about this yesterday and he was resistant to it based on the fact that he was getting better and he felt that he could help the ballclub
324424 even though he may be able to play in 12 days instead of 15 i think we can take this luxury now that we have manny and weve got a little more bench strength hes just taking one for the team basically

324440 basic logic of the law is straightforward if the public is endangered the government must act
324441 work with cdc to remove from the testimony any discussion of the human health consequences of climate change
324442 first part of a master plan aimed at covering up the real dangers of global warming and hiding the facts from the public
324443 a dministration recognized that the only supportable answer to the supreme court was to find that greenhouse gases endanger the public they also recognized that a finding of endangerment would have profound consequences and the initial decisions for how to apply the clean air act would set the stage for years to come
324444 april 16 2008 president bush called on congress to pass new legislation and to amend the clean air act so that it did not need to be used to regulate greenhouse gases
324445 this president i believe made a decision that flies in the face of a supreme court case and so i believe it is clearly unlawful
324446 based on the evidence before him the administrator believes it is reasonable to conclude current and future emissions of greenhouse gases will contribute to future climate change
324447 in areas where heat waves already occur they are expected to be
324448 where water resources are already scarce and over allocated in the western u s climate change is expected to put additional strain on these water management issues for municipal agricultural energy and industrial uses
324449 climate change also introduces additional stress on ecosystems which are already affected by development habitat fragmentation and broken ecological dynamics
324450 in sum the administrator is proposing to find that elevated levels of greenhouse gas concentrations may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public welfare
324451 it validates the approval of californias waiver to regulate greenhouse gases from motor vehicles it demonstrates that the transportation departments proposed fuel economy standards fall far short of what is technologically feasible and cost effective and it makes a strong case supporting how the existing clean air act can be used to regulate greenhouse gases
324452 watered down version of the original proposal that offers no conclusion
324453 included detailed alternative approaches on how to regulate greenhouse gases from fuels vehicles and stationary sources such as power plants
324454 instead the document reviews the legal and economic issues presented by declaring greenhouse gases a pollutant
324455 if theres no action before 2012 thats too late what we do in the next two to three years will determine our future this is the defining moment
324456 access to information is one of the best tools we have for protecting the environment
324457 by contrast closing the environmental protection agency libraries actually threatens to subtract from the sum total of human knowledge
324458 i think it was a timely decision a needed decision
324459 and itll have a very positive impact on our mission as well as our overall force and their families
324460 its a significant step because 15 month deployments took an extraordinary toll
324461 so to bring that back to 12 months for every active duty army unit i think is a huge step in the right direction
324462 the support the families are providing those whove deployed and serve today has been the best ive ever seen it
324463 we could not achieve the mission success weve enjoyed without that unbelievable support
324464 it shall be known that in 2008 the world will be blessed
324465 barack obama may be the one but is he ready to lead
324466 senator mccain can keep telling everyone how proud he is of these political stunts which even his republican friends and advisors have called childish but barack obama will continue talking about his plan to jumpstart our economy by giving working families 1 000 dollars of immediate relief
324467 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
324468 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
324469 excuse me young man this is going to be a question and answer session so you can ask a question later
324470 why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african american community or black community in this country
324471 i think youre misinformed when you say not one time
324472 every issue that youve spoken about i actually did speak out of
324473 what i said was what i think everybody knows which is that i dont look like i came out of central casting when it comes to presidential candidates
324474 i had just stepped out of the bathtub and was busily rubbing myself with a towel when i heard the steps
324475 tal vez entre los brasile os esta percepci n no sea la misma que la que tienen los argentinos sobre brasil pero aqu la impresi n es que hoy el brasil presidido por lula es el lado opuesto a argentina
324476 brasil es visto como un pa s que est m s organizado que argentina con mayor previsibilidad y una lectura correcta de lo que est ocurriendo en el mundo para el elector argentino nada de eso est ocurriendo en argentina en este momento

324480 from a historical perspective eta is very weak at an organisational level it is nothing compared with what it was 10 or 15 years ago
324481 but at the same time it still relies on support in the basque country to find new recruits
324482 i fear giving it to my children directly unless i boil it
324483 up to now we have seen nothing from the government
324484 i had fever headaches and was throwing up all the time
324485 when i was a kid it was blue and clean
324486 but he is not fully responsible for his acts because he was taking drugs nonstop during the four days prior to the killing
324487 my mum had paid for the ticket home and we were looking forward to having her back
324488 he met her out there they were not a couple they had only known each other for a short time
324489 theyve obviously done well being in first place without me to this point
324490 in search of winning a world series title that was important my kids are getting older and it wasnt the situation in seattle where i wanted to get closer to home it was a chance for me winning a title i think that was the biggest draw
324491 theres things that i can do to help this ballclub
324492 having a manager ozzie guillen who didnt hit very many home runs hes very keen on making sure you get the runner over and knock him in and thats the key to winning ball games ive been around for a little while so i understand the game
324493 i dont worry about him playing center field thats like riding a bike
324494 you know if this guy was out of baseball thats a bit different he was in the outfield for a long time hes obviously not going to be the same junior he was in the 90s but i dont think he should have any problems
324495 these guys have done a great job and i just want to help them get to a common goal and thats winning a title
324496 shifting from his previous opposition to expanded offshore drilling the illinois senator told a florida newspaper he could get behind a compromise with republicans and oil companies to prevent gridlock over energy
324497 ive fought a lot the last few years to be no 1
324498 to be seen as no 1 always is a goal
324499 i thought that i was serving much better and day after day im getting stronger in the segment of my game which is really important coming up to the final stages of the tournament
324500 he was playing too well and my game was not up to scratch
324501 i just had to try and stay tough and not give up
324502 ten bucks ok with you anything else here catch your fancy
324503 i might be driving west from new york on my way back from paris because the melons are in season in fresno and ill send you a postcard and say im on my way
324504 no that wont work we need to schedule in advance
324505 you think we can get a horse to behave like god or do we have to dress up a couple of my cousins in fresno
324506 is it true as someone said that william saroyan is the most famous armenian who ever lived
324507 but they were good words but only a hundred good words
324508 reader take my advice dont die just dont die thats all it doesnt pay
324509 a great living member of the human race died and he is gone and dont you do it
324510 because susannah had always had the sense that she was a supporting character in her own life and it was awful awful awful to know such a thing to have always been part of someone elses story to flail for a way to escape it to have to work so hard so late in the game to discover what she was on her own
324511 it was a place like the face of the moon though it had once been inhabited by people animals things a track mark snaking through the ground might have been an ancient snails path nearby roared an oceany sound looking hard enough you could see the evidence of the world that had been and you did look and hard like a dog surveying a park for another dog because you wanted to see something of yourself in the desiccated landscape because you wanted to believe that the world had a pattern an order to make sense of
324512 but howd ya get hold of that phone how the hell old are ya
324513 it doesnt have to be long but something thats better than what that killer sakakibara wrote
324514 its only when i kill that i am liberated from the constant hatred that i suffer and that i am able to attain peace
324515 it is only when i give pain to people that i can ease my own pain
324516 you have to make him totally vanish from the face of the earth otherwise if hes still alive you wont ever get rid of the darkness thats in your heart
324517 probably he just felt his mother was a pain a real pain if you told adults that was the reason you killed your mother they wouldnt believe you but its the truth the whole worlds a pain
324518 it has been in the family since around 1760 and it belonged to a benedictine convent before that
324519 the figure of 16 million euros has been mentioned but i dont want to comment about that
324520 i have had so many mostly estate agents from austria neighbouring bavaria and germany
324521 we manage most of the austrian lakes so by principle were interested in taking over the mondsee
324522 we recently made an alternative offer to mrs waechter well manage the lake for her for free for two years during which she will continue to receive revenues from it and then well make an offer to buy

324528 we are in a period that feels a lot like 1991 and 1992 and we had similar issues with a recession at that point in time high oil prices and fear of oil supply shortages
324529 for the next several months and i would say for the next year the credit situation that customers are facing in dealerships will take center stage
324530 the marketplace is changing rapidly and automakers that are more flexible in their production will fare better
324531 of his own volition he suggested adding an hour to the questioning the questions were to the point

324536 dicha norma no puede estar por encima del texto constitucional
324537 el caso que se plantea no debe ser visto solo como un asunto de mero derecho y que no se trata s lo de debatir porque es inconstitucional o no el art culo 105 sino que hay procedimientos y hechos administrativos que implicaban la inhabilitaci n

324558 she was 17 she is my first born daughter all i heard was suddenly she was out of the country it wasnt told to me where she was going and what she was going to do
324559 i suddenly found out she was not at home and was overseas as a mother i felt worried i was already worried about her father i have to worry about her thats how i felt it was a bit difficult emotionally but after that i accepted it

324578 come back to the panel to present evidence which could reduce her period of ineligibility
324579 while it is an unfortunate circumstance for an olympian to come this far only to lose a coveted position on the olympic team ms hardy is working expediently and agreeably to resolve the situation with as little impact to the us olympic team as possible
324580 while some might have chosen to exhaust their legal options to try to force their way into the games jessica instead chose to put her teams interests ahead of her own

324661 why wait any longer then we both know what you want and we both know youve got only one thing to offer
324662 you want me to say it fine give me a deal that my lawyer says puts sam clear ill roll over write the whole thing down check my spelling even
324663 no but if youre a hot chick it could be fun
324664 dont you guys have blackwater for that sort of thing
324665 theres a powerful witch and a demon influenced woman leading a cabal that is a threat to national security you will infiltrate their group and take out the two leaders if you do that well erase your records and let you go with the thanks of a grateful nation
324666 and just so you dont get any ideas about double crossing us weve installed fail safes in your chest right by your heart theres a device that will take you and everyone around you out if we push the button its enchanted against tampering if you try to disarm it it will explode lets be clear if either one of you disobeys us well kill the other one then well go after your pal bobby singer
324667 youre well known in the supernatural community you can get in without raising too many suspicions
324668 all i need to know is how to kill them
324669 we want you to cut off the slayers head its the only way to be sure and theres a special requirement for the witch we need her heart and she needs to be alive and awake while you cut it out of her
324670 their compound is protected by a magical barrier that will detect the box crossing its boundaries and sound the alarm so you have to find a way to penetrate the barrier get the box in then kill the witch and the slayer
324671 it says here the barrier detects occult and ill omened objects
324672 have you tried a concealing spell to get through it
324673 you should be able to get it in along with your usual equipment
324674 theyd detect it but you could talk your way around it what with the stuff you usually carry
324675 what do you think we usually carry that box is nothing like our usual tools
324676 thats the plan son you dont have to like it
324677 no and i dont have to do it the box isnt the problem the barrier is once we get inside ill build one of those things no need to set the alarm off in the first place
324678 we do exorcisms we do hauntings but if you want our expertise you cant just use vague euphemisms and expect us to figure it out if this is everything youve got you might as well just kill us right now
324679 if were going in blind were just volunteering for the most creative death a witch and a demonic host can think up demons have been doing this a lot longer than the u s government so i think well take our chances at guantanamo
324680 it may take you a few days to catch up
324681 dean will work up a supply list while im reading
324682 shes not really my type hot sure but i like a chick with more padding good fighter though
324683 you can see its not just going to be a matter of overpowering her its going to take magic
324684 binding spell then something to knock her out dont need to do the heart thing with her so it doesnt have to be complicated gun should work right she nearly died from a gunshot before
324685 shes got a little sister dad left when they were little kids mom died when they were both teens and the slayer took custody
324686 you cant talk about your little assignment with anyone except each other and our friends in power here betrayals just another itch you cant scratch so i say enjoy your work
324687 why are you calling me child you already know what you need to do
324688 i need you to tell me about the slayer and where to find her
324689 thats womens magic boy you sure you want to mess with that
324690 give me an alternative missouri or tell me where she is
324691 tell me again why were ten miles from washington dc
324692 well for one thing i refuse to be driven out of my own country and its not like the military left us alone just because we were across the pond
324693 no i get that but remember california sunny bright sunshine y california
324694 why couldnt faith open the east coast annex of slayertown shes from boston
324695 listen about the three slayers with the prophetic dreams that were all slightly different
324696 they asked to speak to you buffy summers the slayer
324697 im sam winchester this is my brother dean we need your help with a crossroads demon
324698 a psychic missouri moseley told us where to find you we heard you have power serious power and thats what we need what i need to help my brother
324699 he made a deal his soul at the end of a year in exchange for a resurrection
324700 i need a way to break the deal before he gets sent to hell
324701 sometimes we get blamed for whatever it was we came to hunt and sometimes theres a body count
324702 they werent lying but they werent telling the whole truth
324703 but what if it turns out that the one whos going to hell is going for a good reason is that like aiding and abetting a criminals escape karma wise
324704 that how were gonna pay them back if they save my soul
324705 i dont have an alternative dean if i didnt ask them wed still be watching the clock tick down on you and wed still have this job to do
324706 willow might need more information from you about the deal
324707 no ill just take sam here and check it out
324708 we could ring it with a protective spell set it on fire
324709 too bad theres no way for me to get a share of what youve got
324710 so it turned out to be akkadian which no one expected at all because it totally upsets the scholarly consensus on settlement patterns
324711 you kinda lost me at the rosanna stone or whatever thats more sams thing im just good with my hands
324712 i went to uc sunnydale so i could keep helping buffy and i uh had some trouble with magic so i didnt end up graduating i think about going back but it would take so much
324713 i did once upon a time but then i found out what was going on underneath the regular world this is more important im really good at it and thats worth more than a diploma still
324714 i kinda wish i had the diploma too my parents tell people im off finding myself
324715 well two if were talking about a slay heavy schedule
324716 ive never met anybody else who came back from the dead still human
324717 willows the best i dont know the mystical stuff but shell take care of that and then ill hit things
324718 im good at it and im getting better at the leadership stuff
324719 you know i was supposed to lead a demon army to conquer the world
324720 but now there are lots of slayers right the power isnt just in you
324721 and i didnt talk about this job because you know i couldnt so give it a rest
324722 i didnt have the military send those things here to make us look more legit
324723 i didnt all right but i would have if id thought we needed it
324724 if you dont give a shit about yourself think about bobby
324725 and i still didnt have anything to do with it so give it up
324726 yeah i know holding something else against her do you even have a brain up top
324727 thanks for coming i mean it must be good to get to leave hell but thanks anyway
324728 i never turn down a chance to earn points with the slayer so i hear you have some buyers remorse
324729 no get that clear right now i want the deal and i wont do anything to break it
324730 sweetheart you get me out of this ill kiss you anywhere you want
324731 theres no deal of course theres a deal there was a meeting of the minds the demon performed but theres no such thing as a perfect contract thats what keeps lawyers in business
324732 i cant help any further without a copy of the contract youd make a good lawyer sam if you ever decide to go back to school my firms doing a lot of rebuilding you could do well with us
324733 its a hell dimension of course but a special one
324734 i dont think you can do anything the protections on the contract wont let any involved party get near it i guess its something about fraud so deans definitely out and youre the subject of the contract which probably counts
324735 i can take care of myself plus ill have buffy with me
324736 weve got a portable air filtration system now it should be fine
324737 this might not have been what we expected but i know one rule about hells you never take anything you didnt specifically come for you dont eat you dont drink and you dont try on shoes
324738 my destiny is to cross this desert but i can see no way
324739 but whenever i try i am absorbed into the sand and even if i dash myself at the desert i can only go a little distance
324740 the wind does not dash itself against the desert sand
324741 you are thinking in the wrong way trying to fly by yourself is absurd allow the wind to carry you over the sand
324742 it is so and you must believe it or you will simply be sucked down by the sands to form after several million years a quagmire
324743 but if that is so will i be the same river that i am today
324744 you cannot in any case remain the same stream that you are today the choice is not open to you it only seems to be open the wind will carry your essence the finer part of you when you became a river again at the mountains beyond the sands men may call you by a different name but you yoursef essentially will know that you are the same today you call yourself such and such a river only because you do not know which part of it is even now your essence
324745 why could i not reason this out on my own why did the sands have to tell me what would have happened if i had not listened to the sands
324746 only the sands know for they have seen it happen moreover they extend from the river to the mountain

324842 i wrote a letter because the fcc which usually makes a decision within 400 days had gone almost 800 days
324843 in the letter i said i am not telling you how to make a decision im just telling you that you should move forward and make a decision on this issue and i believe that was appropriate

324857 barack came to me and said if alice decides she wants to run i want to run for her state senate seat
324858 i think he was very strategic in his choice of friends and mentors
324859 i spent ten years of my adult life working to be alderman i finally got elected this is a job i love and im perfectly happy with it im not sure thats the way that he approached his public life that he was going to try for a job and stay there for one period of time in retrospect i think he saw the positions he held as stepping stones to other things and therefore approached his public life differently than other people might have
324860 its a church that would provide you with lots of social connections and prominent parishioners
324861 its a good place for a politician to be a member
324862 who you take money from is a reflection of your knowledge at the time and your principles
324863 i dont think you should forget who your friends are
324864 my view is you have to bring your constituency along with you granted you have to make some tough decisions granted sometimes you have to make decisions that people wont understand or like but its your obligation to explain yourself and try to do your supporters the courtesy of treating them with respect
324865 all the work we did to help him get where he finally ended up he didnt seem too appreciative
324866 can you get where he is and maintain your personal integrity
324867 you just dont come to chicago and plant your flag
324868 when i first came to chicago adlai stevenson and paul douglas were running for governor and senator
324869 i had heard about the closed party closed machine but they sounded like such great candidates so i stopped in to volunteer in the eighth ward regular democratic headquarters
324870 i then chronicled for the next four years her systematic abrogation of every commitment she had made to reform she became sort of a parody of a machine mayor
324871 he saw the jagged edges of chicago politics and urban politics pretty close up
324872 when i started organizing i understood the idea of social change in a very abstract way
324873 it was to some extent informed by my years in indonesia seeing extreme poverty and disparities of wealth and understanding sort of in a dim way that life wasnt fair and government had something to do with it
324874 but i didnt come out of a political family didnt have a history of activism in my family so i understood these things in the abstract when i went to chicago it was the first time that i had the opportunity to test out my ideas and for the most part i would say i wasnt wildly successful the victories that we achieved were extraordinarily modest you know getting a job training site set up or getting an after school program for young people put in place
324875 i remember our first few meetings he would say do you know so and so and id say yes how well do you know him id really like to meet him i would set up some lunches
324876 if you want to look at the means of ascent if you will look at project vote
324877 was making connections at the grassroots level and was working with elected officials thats when he first got a scan of the broader black political infrastructure
324878 is where a lot of the divisional rivalries popped up
324879 black activists community folks felt that he didnt respect their role
324880 he was typical of what most aspiring politicians are self centered that i can do anything and im willing to do it overnight
324881 he met people not just in the african american community but in the progressive white community
324882 the folks who funded project vote were some of the key progressive leaders
324883 i honestly dont remember what it was about him but i was absolutely blown away
324884 i said to several people that this guy who is now thirty years old is someday going to be president he will be our first black president
324885 when you go work for judd miners law firm thats another kind of political statement
324886 i think it might have been helpful with a certain group of people that barack may have wanted to have at his back at the outset so you get the support of the liberals and the progressives and the reformers and then that gives you a base to then expand to pick up other folks and then folks would be willing to give money to the bright shiny new candidate
324887 theyve shown a remarkable willingness to take on the democratic organization and the democratic establishment in this city and win which is why i like them and a lot of people hate them
324888 yeah yeah okay come over and meet my aunt gracie and dont tell anybody that
324889 to some extent im a symbolic stand in for a lot of the changes that have been made
324890 galvanized chicagos political community as no seasoned politico had before
324891 under baracks leadership we had the most successful cost effective and orderly voter registration drive ive ever been involved with
324892 i began to see my identity and my individual struggles were one with the struggles that folks face in chicago
324893 they fall somewhere lower than lawyers i want to inspire a renewal of morality in politics i will work as hard as i can as long as i can on your behalf
324894 barack obama carries on the tradition of independence in this district his candidacy is a passing of the torch
324895 you have to understand its 1995 its the year after the republicans have taken over control of congress and in illinois all three branches of government were also controlled by the republicans so it was a really dark point i was looking to be engaged in something that would mean something that would actually get something done and that was beyond symbols around the same time that i started up with barack volunteering on his campaign i had gone to some of the old community groups and nationalist organizations i respected what they had done but i didnt feel like that was really where i wanted to be
324896 when you go to a political meeting and you see a couple of guys or girls at the back of the room and they arent glad handing or anything those are the operators
324897 i dont think he said he wanted to run for president but he indicated that he was into public service for the long haul
324898 i remember very clearly i said to sam if this guy is for real he could be the first african american president of the united states
324899 to step aside like other african americans have done in other races for the sake of unity and to release palmer from her commitment
324900 i had given him my word i would support him
324901 alice didnt forgive me and shes never going to forgive me
324902 these old nationalist guys start beating a drum probably not the right metaphor about how barack should let this elder back in and how senioritys important
324903 another local paper covering chicagos black community a comment in the
324904 if she doesnt run that seat will go to a daley supporter we have asked her to reconsider not running because we dont think obama can win he hasnt been in town long enough nobody knows who he is we need someone with experience
324905 he ran unopposed which is a good way to win
324906 anyone who enters chicago politics and cant take the rough and tumble shouldnt be there losing the seat was just that not the end of the world
324907 it established a reputation that youre not going to punk me youre not going to roll me over youre not going to jam me i think it established him as a threat you have his independence with project vote you have his refusal to knuckle under during the alice palmer thing and so now you have a series of data points that have some established leaders in the black community feeling disrespected and so the stage is now set for the comeuppance during the congressional race that was their payback
324908 for the first time since it was enacted in 1935 we are about to repeal a core provision of the social security act
324909 seems to me to be a classic example of somebody who had no reason to run youre seventy three years old youre already the third most powerful man in the country so why and bill clinton well his campaigns fascinating to a student of politics its disturbing to someone who cares about certain issues but politically it seems to be working
324910 last year president clinton signed a bill that for the first time in 60 years eliminates the federal guarantee of support for poor families and their children
324911 i am not a defender of the status quo with respect to welfare
324912 having said that i probably would not have supported the federal legislation because i think it had some problems but im a strong believer in making lemonade out of lemons
324913 i supported governor edgars plan to raise the income tax
324914 were all on the liberal wing of the democratic party
324915 politics are politics crime is crime but in chicago they occasionally overlap the line between virtue and vice meanders madly effective government on one side connections on the other
324916 big labor and big capital blue and white collars and minorities
324917 it became increasingly difficult to get into homes and apartments to talk about candidates
324918 high rises were tough if not impossible to crack and other parts of the city had become too dangerous to walk around in for hours at a time and people didnt want to answer their doors thus the increasing dependence on tv radio direct mail phone banking robocalls et cetera all things that cost a hell of a lot more money than patronage workers who were themselves in decline anyway because of anti patronage court rulings
324919 they do well and you get a 5 million to 10 million war chest
324920 our relationship deepened when i started my first political campaign for the state senate
324921 the developers were thinking in market terms and operating under the rules of the marketplace but at the same time we had government supporting and subsidizing those efforts
324922 he hung around a lot of the downstaters they became good friends
324923 it looked like two men that were having a serious disagreement and they had walked up to one another really close
324924 hes the one that got mad because he said i embarrassed him on the senate floor thats when he came over to my desk
324925 im not part of some long standing political organization i have no fancy sponsors im not even from chicago my name is obama despite that fact somebody sent me the men on the corner in woodlawn drowning their sorrows in alcohol the women working two jobs theyre all telling me we cant wait
324926 ive got to make assessments about where we go from here
324927 we need a new style of politics to deal with the issues that are important to the people whats not clear to me is whether i should do that as an elected official or by influencing government in ways that actually improve peoples lives
324928 he thought he would get some help from daley because rush had run against daley for mayor
324929 he thought that daley might use the opportunity to get even
324930 when you lose a race you can be strong in another avenue and he was always strong in his congressional district it was a learning experience when i lost to harold washington the next day i endorsed him
324931 you learn from defeat if you dont learn from defeat then you go away as a sour politician you think that people turned on you barack obama understood that the lesson from that campaign is you cant just run for any office saying you thought someone lost an election and you thought they were weak he realized that and he rededicated himself
324932 even though the university of chicago is one of the largest employers on the south side of chicago it is seen by some particularly black nationalists as a bastion of white political power as a huge entity that doesnt take into account the interests of the community that doesnt have a full democratic partnership with the community and does what it wants to the community in maintaining clear boundaries about where black people are
324933 you know the north side and the south side of like two different worlds
324934 the accusations were that obama was sent here and owned by the jews
324935 that he was here to steal the black vote and steal black land and that he was represented by the as they were called the white man and that obama wasnt black enough and didnt know the black experience the black community it was quite deafening in terms of how they went after alderman preckwinkle and myself people would say oh kindle man we trust you you being fooled obamas got you fooled and some people called me a traitor
324936 the first time i heard him talk to a black church he was very professorial more so even than he was in the white community there was no joking no self deprecation no style it didnt go over well at all
324937 i remember one of the candidates in the race used to talk about how crazed our volunteers were because they were passionate energized
324938 youd come by the office on eighty seventh street and thered be a bunch of guys with no teeth waiting to get their next old grand dad and then these shiraz drinking nation reading t n r quoting young black folk it was a random ass mix it was beautiful though when i see the crowds now theyre very reminiscent of what was happening then
324939 he learned that for barack obama it was not the type of district that he was well suited for
324940 the type of campaign that he had to run to win that district is not barack obama it was a predominantly african american district it was a district where you had to campaign solely on those issues and barack did not campaign that way and so as a result he lost which was good
324941 he saw that when we were doing fund raisers in the rush campaign his appeal to quite frankly young white professionals was dramatic
324942 the exposure he would get to some of the folks that were on boards of the museums and c e o s of some of the companies that he would represent would certainly help him in the long run
324943 there is a conflict of interest built into the process
324944 incumbents drawing their own maps will inevitably try to advantage themselves
324945 the world as it is and not as we would like it to be
324946 i was very proud to be able to introduce him during the senate race to a lot of people who have turned out to be important and valuable to him not just here but in new york and l a
324947 i try and think about people who i think should know him
324948 everybody came in and all they cared about was their districts it wasnt any one particular legislator from any one particular community i learned a lot about state government their job was not to respond to september 11th they were more worried about making sure that they had a district that they could run in for re lection
324949 he was one of the main people we wanted but he was speaking at the university of wisconsin that day
324950 professors are being turned in on college campuses bushs ratings are eighty seven per cent
324951 among my friends there hasnt been an antiwar demonstration in twenty years theres huge repression bush has got all this legislation theyre talking about lists theyre denying people entry into the country bushs numbers were tremendously high but we had no choice unless we wanted to live in a country that was fascist
324952 he was a hyde park state senator he had to oppose the war
324953 let me begin by saying that although this has been billed as an antiwar rally i stand before you as someone who is not opposed to war in all circumstances
324954 the civil war was one of the bloodiest in history and yet it was only through the crucible of the sword the sacrifice of multitudes that we could begin to perfect this union and drive the scourge of slavery from our soil i dont oppose all wars my grandfather signed up for a war the day after pearl harbor was bombed fought in pattons army he saw the dead and dying across the fields of europe he heard the stories of fellow troops who first entered auschwitz and treblinka he fought in the name of a larger freedom part of that arsenal of democracy that triumphed over evil and he did not fight in vain i dont oppose all wars
324955 he didnt start telling people he was interested in running for senate until he figured out what the road map was
324956 he had a good sense of the odds and he knew there were certain things that had to happen
324957 then he just laid out an economic analysis it becomes about money because he knew that if people knew his story they would view him as a better candidate than anybody else he thought might be in the field and so he said therefore if you raise five million dollars i have a fifty per cent chance of winning if you raise seven million dollars i have a seventy per cent chance of winning if you raise ten million dollars i guarantee victory
324958 participated in a small group that met weekly when rod was running for governor
324959 we basically laid out the general election barack and i and these two
324960 there was an advisory council that was inclusive of rahm and barack but not limited to them
324961 he had been my client and i had a very good relationship with him but i didnt sign on to the governors race
324962 obviously he won but i had concerns about it i was concerned about whether he was ready for that not so much for the race but for governing i was concerned about some of the folks i was concerned about how the race was being approached
324963 the political bosses knew they had to have what they used to call in business a loss leader the showcasing
324964 the car that you sold for under its value for advertising purposes while you had at the top of your ticket a shining star under that it was like turning over a rock
324965 i guess he figured i was part of the establishment
324966 he didnt know too much about politics and he was very idealistic
324967 provided himself with tens of thousands of dollars in interest free loans from his campaign fund
324968 has always made it a practice to pay back the loans and continues to do so
324969 when he ran that race against bobby rush he had no one supporting him who had political influence over others and whom people respected so he was out there as a lone wolf in that race
324970 we never discussed it but he had to analyze that race and recognize he had no other powerful elected officials supporting him
324971 and so he felt i could be very very key if he was going to make the run for the u s senate
324972 in politics you must know who is connected to whom
324973 the mayor of chicago and the father of dan hynes
324974 because he had been in the minority barack didnt have a legislative record to run on and there was a buildup of all these great ideas that the republicans kept in the rules committee when they were in the majority
324975 jones basically gave obama the space to do what obama wanted to do emil made it clear to people that it would be good for them
324976 you have the power to make a united states senator
324977 i am not thrilled with barack simply because we elected him as an independent and he switched over to daley
324978 when he won the primary out here and he went downtown it appears as though daley took over the campaign for him we were excluded
324979 i think theres kind of this wizard of oz mystique
324980 she got as the saying goes run over by a bus
324981 we were talking about whether he was ready to do this or not
324982 as i see it the two things that youre going to need to address are your executive leadership skills because your r sum doesnt have that in it and the second would be your credentials in national security
324983 my dad told me that youve got to strike while the iron is hot
324984 we were walking down the street late in the afternoon

325194 shortly after they the officers came into contact with the two occupants of the vehicle they realized that one of the occupants was choking
325195 subsequent analysis of the contents of the bag revealed it to be what we suspect is crack cocaine
325196 in the printed edition of vegas magazine brittany also talks about her new movie black water transit where she claims she wears nothing the entire time and has sex with everyone
325197 i love magic and am really looking forward to doing the show in vegas
325198 kind considerate polite gentleman who goes into the big tippers book
325199 your performance tonight exceeded my expectations it was such a special evening
325200 our performances are more about the art of burlesque we try to stay true to what burlesque was back in its heyday the sometimes frilly sometimes shiny and always sexy burlesque costumes help turn back the clock and bring back the pin up era if only during the performances whether its a fan dance a snake charmer skit a holiday inspired routine or the classic shimmy vintage burlesque groups like babes in sin are the intelligent alternative to the modern girls gone wild burlesque has more visual foreplay and as cha cha pictured right notes
325201 for me its been great being part of this troupe has really done a lot for me i have an outlet to be creative though my choreography and costume design i really have fun with my numbers i try to add a little humor or a trick to my performances i am also know to twirl my tassel like no other
325202 i go with my best friend summer who is also in the show with me we go to places like bebe bebe sport charlotte rouse and guess we just like to go try on clothes and sometimes buy matching stuff we usually go get something to eat too
325203 the first stop is at the candy shop and i buy enough to last me all day long and especially gummy fish
325204 i usually end up spending too much money i always buy clothes and especially shoes i like the fashion show mall the best
325205 its total chaos i like to buy clothes makeup and accessories like shoes i like to shop at boca park and stay within my budget
325206 i like to go to the fashion show mall and pretty much buy whatever catches my eye i like bebe and abercrombie im usually never looking for anything in particular
325207 i buy shoes at bee bee sport at the fashion show mall i may spend a half a day to a whole day
325208 inside every empowered woman is a pussycat doll purring and hissing her way out they have that special kind of confidence every woman can understand what that means and live that philosophy every day every woman wants to be sexy and feel sexy its all about a girl who is very confident and loves to get dressed up like a doll not trashy or slutty but somebody who everyday whether walking down the street or going to the store just owns it with attitude and empowerment a pussycat doll gets up on stage and performs with that same confidence that every woman can have with the same feeling and same vibe about owning every day owning your womanhood its easier today for women to seize this empowerment and enjoy it it wasnt so easy in years gone by because they had to hide and cover up their strengths and just show weakness thank goodness times have changed and weve now got that power
325209 in the pussycat dolls lounge everything is carefully choreographed but in the casino i didnt just want a go go dancer without dance training you can make go go dancing look so much better if you have that training its the same kind of girl but in the pit they have to provide a theatrical performance at the same time as the dancing i am really happy with them theyre energetic appealing and sexy in my wildest dreams i never would have imagined us being part of a casino its so incredible their outfits in the gaming pit pictured above are not exactly the same as in the lounge i designed uniform styled outfits that are just as sexy but somewhat different and now we will be selling merchandise and pcd lingerie inspired by those costumes
325210 pure already is home to the las vegas pussycat dolls lounge and now this casino is the final part of a dream come true i began the pussycat dolls 12 years ago but only dreamed about opening a casino the last few years you always think something could go wrong and its not going to happen but honestly everything was completely smooth with this venture my partners at caesars and pure were great and i cant believe we are actually here this is such a new chapter in my life and the life of the dolls incidentally our tv show search for the next pussycat doll premieres on tuesday in the tv show we use all our vegas casino fun stuff to tie in with the show a lot of the lingerie will start in the pit and lead to the lounge and then to your own home
325211 were tackling that competition head on its the same demographic and with a nightclub on the gaming floor weve got them beat these are just beautiful women they are not being suggestive or vulgar we watch that very carefully and dancing up a storm theyre even sexier with their clothes still on the reaction is incredible its far more than we ever expected the energy and excitement is terrific and everybody male and female young and old enjoys and welcomes their special brand of glitz and glamour we had our soft opening back on super bowl weekend and its just gone from strength to strength the numbers are really solid our dealers have great personalities and upbeat positive attitudes its become another must see attraction at caesars this has been such a big success leading up to tonights official celebrity opening that were now going to expand the 9pm 4am hours and start from noon everyday right throughout march madness well then keep the pussycats casino open much longer than we have been
325212 yes you need to buy more of those things for all the spaces up there
325213 those are wine bottles and we dont really need anymore because we only drink it on very special occasions we have plenty
325214 i memember a story about jesus and his friends makin some wine at a wedding
325215 weddings are special occasions because people go there to get some kids
325216 after you go to your wedding god gives you your kids right
325217 the x girls are a talented group of gorgeous dancers and their new burlesque project brings an energetic and sexy production to the resort
325218 we are excited to add this edgy show to our already dynamic line up
325219 x has always been known for pushing the envelope and x burlesque will take that to the next level
325220 the dancers are amazing the routines are unique and the tops are off
325221 our guests have come to expect the absolute best whether it be dining gaming entertainment or with our hotel rooms and spa services michael is the perfect addition to our family of headline names and keeps us a cut above the competition
325222 caesars has set new standards of excellence in the past few years now were raising the bar in the salon spa industry and i am thrilled to be part of it
325223 i love vegas i come for the shows the sports the restaurants and the shopping and now im coming for the spa this was the perfect mini vacation squeezed in between miss america and returning to canada for a christmas movie for disney
325224 i use luxe ingredients but i dont take myself seriously i respect the food i work with i simply fell in love with the kitchen this is a fun adventure where my goal is to engage all the sense i decided to abandon the traditional approach to food and incorporate all kinds of crazy twists but in the end it has to taste fantastic and it does i simply wanted to awe my guests and make dining with me the most joyful experience of their day
325225 the x girls are a talented group of gorgeous dancers and their new burlesque project brings an energetic and sexy production to the resort
325226 we like to keep x fresh and have something new for the fans to see the producers brought in
325227 several contestants showed up in a surprise appearance trying to snag the title away from katie but they were no match for the beautiful and talented former beauty queen
325228 im going there and well make something beautiful happen out of what was a totally unfair mess for me but thats in the past im not looking back im going forward and well try to have the success i wanted originally
325229 we dont want to frighten people we want them to take precautions
325230 recently i have become aware of the growing body of literature linking long term cell phone use to possible adverse health effects including cancer
325231 although the evidence is still controversial i am convinced that there are sufficient data to warrant issuing an advisory to share some precautionary advice on cell phone use
325232 my own take on all the available reports is that they suggest a problem to be concerned about
325233 mmmm impressive but no thanks i already have a sharpie
325234 my familys worried ive got alzheimers but i know i havent
325235 what ensued was a very messy scene where the anesthesiologists could not reintubate the patient and the surgeon could not establish
325236 an indictment albeit at an unfortunate time politically for the hospital on the nursing and respiratory care at sharp grossmont
325237 the patient did have complications post surgery in icu coded and expired
325238 there is no evidence at this time the tube was dislodged and definitely no information regarding lack of observation
325239 i honestly believe this message is coming from an individual who has a history of conflict with our management a man who has intent to harm sharp grossmont publicly
325240 medical record keeping was purposefully watered down to avoid stating what actually happened and to avoid a formal inquiry and autopsy
325241 including minute by minute patient monitoring data in the recovery room during which time mr houtkin
325242 i would likely have brought the case in for autopsy
325243 which is a sneaker that incorporates some interesting and innovative functions
325244 this organization saved my life im so very excited this is a dream i never thought would come true i watched miss america as a little girl since i was two years old and never in my wildest dreams did i think i would be miss america but thats whats wonderful about this organization
325245 i havent spoken to her in a few days but her phone number will be on speed dial ill probably be talking to her tonight
325246 after i was one of the top ten semi finalists everything else was icing on the cake and i said now i can just have fun said the new miss america
325247 being in the top five i was just so excited to sing on national tv
325248 when mario lopez said my name my knees buckled i went straight to the ground
325249 the emotions inside are so surreal to know i have the crown on my head and the sash says miss america 2007
325250 id like to eat some caramel cheesecake from the cheesecake factory to celebrate
325251 after 90 minutes of competition it came down to five finalists all from the southern part of the country in addition to miss oklahoma the other finalists are miss georgia miss texas miss alabama and miss mississippi
325252 if a party stages a protest on the house floor but no one can see or hear it does it make a sound
325253 thats the question at hand right now as house republicans have essentially taken over the house floor to protest the lack of action on energy legislation despite the fact that the chamber has officially recessed for the august break
325254 adjourned the house turned off the lights and killed the microphones but republicans are still on the floor talking gas prices
325255 at one point the lights went off in the house and the microphones were turned off in the chamber meaning republicans were talking in the dark but as rep john shadegg r ariz was speaking the lights went back on and the microphones were turned on shortly afterward
325256 but c span which has no control over the cameras in the chamber has stopped broadcasting the house floor meaning no one was witnessing this except the assembled republicans their aides and one democrat rep dennis j kucinich d ohio who has now left
325257 only about a half dozen republicans were on the floor when this began but the crowd has grown to about 20 according to patrick oconnor
325258 percibe que la intenci n de las empresas es boicotear la compra para impedirle al instituto estar preparado para enfrentar la competencia
325259 lo dijimos se trata de una competencia de burro amarrado contra tigre suelto donde la experiencia de otros pa ses de am rica latina ense a que la entidad estatal es asfixiada por unas multinacionales que no tienen ning n escr pulo y s lo buscan grandes ganancias sin importar el servicio solidario p blico
325260 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
325261 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
325262 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
325263 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
325264 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
325265 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
325266 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
325267 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
325268 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
325269 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
325270 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
325271 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
325272 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
325273 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
325274 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
325275 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
325276 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
325277 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
325278 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
325279 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
325280 who are open to doing something on the production side
325281 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
325282 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
325283 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
325284 yet even the unsportsmanlike tossing of a live lobster onto the go cart track is not what cost me the race
325285 for in striking the crustacean with my right wheel i was literally thrown nay launched into the air and im sure youre all aware of the slowing of time that occurs in such instances and i can tell you now from what i felt of the physics of what had transpired i assure you after two revolutions in the air i was actually about to land on four wheels and still be in control of first place
325286 i agree i may not have been able to control the vehicle after such a landing but i will never know
325287 you will never know how does this preposterous story end
325288 well as my vehicle was about to make its second revolution bringing me down to the track a brown pelican blundered straight into the roll cage of my flying conveyance and struck my helmet knocking me unconscious in an explosion of feathers
325289 a pelican my god man what did you do next
325290 what did i do next i woke to find myself completely addled and upside down in the roll cage of a go cart covered in pelican blood and feathers men were busy trying to free me from the seatbelts and a few moments later i was being examined and questioned by a most lovely woman who was a nurse at the local hospital who was there to watch her husband in the next race
325291 i was too confused from the crash to drive myself home and my clothes were covered in blood and feathers
325292 i walked have you ever tried hailing a cab in a bloody chicken suit
325293 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
325294 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
325295 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
325296 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
325297 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
325298 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
325299 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
325300 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
325301 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
325302 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
325303 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
325304 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
325305 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
325306 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
325307 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
325308 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
325309 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
325310 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
325311 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
325312 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
325313 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
325314 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
325315 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
325316 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
325317 it has been in the family since around 1760 and it belonged to a benedictine convent before that
325318 the figure of 16 million euros has been mentioned but i dont want to comment about that
325319 i have had so many mostly estate agents from austria neighbouring bavaria and germany
325320 we manage most of the austrian lakes so by principle were interested in taking over the mondsee
325321 we recently made an alternative offer to mrs waechter well manage the lake for her for free for two years during which she will continue to receive revenues from it and then well make an offer to buy

325323 ich verfolge die diskussion mit sorge und frage mich warum muss man die bundesliga unbedingt bis 20 uhr im frei empfangbaren fernsehen gesehen haben
325324 die premier league in england kassiert 1 2 milliarden im jahr vom fernsehen die spanischen klubs zusammen 800 millionen noch immer fast doppelt so viel wie der deutsche liga fu ball es ist nun mal nicht mehr so wie bei fritz walter der im gegenwert von ein paar eintrittskarten fu ball gespielt hat wenn das kartellamt sich durchsetzt wird bis auf bayern m nchen im internationalen gesch ft kein deutscher verein mehr mithalten k nnen
325325 es w rde mich ehrlich schrecken wenn fu ball ein derart elit rer sport w rde zu dem nur noch die besserverdienenden gehen k nnen so wie es fr her beim tennis war oder beim golf
325326 was zum beispiel abgelaufen ist als unsere b jugend gegen borussia dortmund deutscher meister wurde ist an perversion und peinlichkeit nicht zu berbieten gewesen da haben 20 chaoten aus dortmund einen widerlichen rabatz gemacht
325327 tats chlich ich fahre vielleicht nach m nchen und gehe ganz weit oben unterm dach in eine loge
325328 f r das falsche signal aber ich verspreche auch solche ausw chse wie beim b jugend finale wird es in unserem stadion nicht mehr geben das werden die polizei und der ordnungsdienst nicht mehr zulassen
325329 es stimmt nicht dass wir in jedem fall mehr zahlen es gibt beispiele von anderen klubs die nachwauchspielern mehr geboten haben als wir
325330 die kinder kommen zu uns weil sie hier eine intensivere und qualitativ besser f rderung erwartet das ist das geheimnis
325331 dass nat rlich die verantwortlichen in frankfurt sagen der broghammer sei mit geld gelockt worden das verstehe ich ja das ist deren rechtfertigung richtig ist aber das hat mir die familie broghammer am telefon best tigt dass es nicht am geld lag sondern an der perspektive
325332 we believe that politicizing the olympics does not favor resolving these issues and also violates the olympic spirit
325333 we hope that foreign reporters while in china will respect our laws and rules report objectively and help communication and understanding between china and the peoples of the world
325334 the determining factor in securing the success of the olympic games is to work vigorously to promote the olympic spirit featuring friendship solidarity and peace
325335 the key is to ensure that athletes from all countries will have a level playing field to compete fairly
325336 anybody who could be so brutal to an innocent puppy is a danger to society
325337 he confessed but he is not fully responsible for his acts because he was taking drugs nonstop during the four days prior to the killing
325338 he met her out there they were not a couple they had only known each other for a short time
325339 i was in vegas last weekend for a bachelorette party and saw how hectic it is to plan a wedding so ive decided to start planning mine before being asked
325340 theyre in love but football practice is starting so no wedding bells for at least six months to a year
325341 in my opinion if an animal in the wild like a swan is caught being gay it should be shot on sight disinfected and used to feed the poor
325342 so you think if no one believed in any religion there would be no wars or fighting i think it would be worse i know if i didnt fear gods judgement i would have killed many many times
325343 you are banned you are not a christian for christians dont accuse brothers and sisters in christ of being non christian
325344 if we did evolve from monkeys then how come babies arent born monkeys and how come we dont speak monkey
325345 if the bible is wrong when it tells us it is infallible then it contradicts itself if it contradicts itself then it is unreliable if it is unreliable then our faith is totally shattered and christianity is a lie you need to seriously reconsider your logic

325347 im not fed up besides there are new songs on the page and shows booked through 2010 its all fun

325357 what youve got to look forward to with him is once that becomes second nature then theres another part of him that we saw in the fall that just absolutely goes out there and makes some of the most phenomenal athletic plays hes got the hands hes got the natural instincts to go up hes not just straightaway hes straightaway fast but hes got that make you miss stuff to go
325358 it gives them the experience with out getting hurt or anything else
325359 i think most people are stepping out of their standard missions for the convoy stuff thats why were here for so long to make sure were trained and actually ready to do that
325360 you need to get used to what youre firing you need to know what the weapon feels like as you fire it
325361 is it easier having a relative here to do it with
325362 if we have anything to vent we have any questions we can go to each other
325363 its not that hard to keep up with it its nothing very difficult
325364 i think when you go to a restaurant and youre paying decent money for a nice meal you should feel safe and confident the food is going to come out normal
325365 salmonella which weve seen if theyre not washing their food properly diarrhea illnesses or vomiting
325366 we recently came across your site while searching for bloggers
325367 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
325368 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
325369 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
325370 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
325371 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
325372 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
325373 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
325374 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
325375 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
325376 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
325377 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
325378 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
325379 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
325380 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
325381 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
325382 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
325383 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
325384 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
325385 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
325386 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
325387 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
325388 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
325389 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
325390 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
325391 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
325392 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
325393 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
325394 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
325395 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
325396 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
325397 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
325398 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
325399 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
325400 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
325401 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
325402 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
325403 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
325404 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
325405 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
325406 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
325407 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
325408 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
325409 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

325416 the deadline passed and i thought wow all that and nothing
325417 and then a half hour after the deadline passed i get called into the managers office and they say youve been traded if i was a free agent i couldnt have picked a better place to go to than boston i dont think
325418 its tough to all of a sudden have it click that youve been submersed in the middle of a pennant race and you have a chance to win a ring i dont think its going to resonate that quick i think that i might need a day or two to let it sink in but i fully intend to let it sink in
325419 i just thought of it as they need a left fielder regardless of what happened before i got here im going to play left field here and i cant wait
325420 hes going to hit for a pretty good average and hes going to play great defence for you hes going to be a fun player to watch
325421 if youre going to replace manny ramirez youre not going to replace his stats
325422 if youre going to replace him youre hoping to get a good teammate and thats what we got
325423 i saw him be banged up in 06 thinking no way is he playing tonight he played every night he never talked about anything if his knee was bothering him he just went out there and played and never made an excuse for anything thats the bottom line this guy is a gamer
325424 i wouldnt have any idea this early in the preseason whether thatd be an accurate ranking
325425 i know its something thats not very significant until the end of the year and thats what we talked about with the team
325426 once we hold up that acc trophy everythings going to be fine

325432 were going to be in a position where were going to ask some young kids to really contribute in a significant way meaningful minutes on the field
325433 and they really already know the basics because weve been doing summer workouts and holding captains practices where well teach the young guys plays and get them adjusted to being in the college atmosphere
325434 so by the time two a days roll around we can just continue to just grow and learn some new things
325435 were going to have to have our older guys or guys with more experience really mentor these young guys because theyre talented
325436 now it comes down to can we develop them into a college player
325437 would be to admit defeat and frankly we felt there was no higher priority than to stay on this effort
325438 it is disappointing to me that in very hot weather states like arizona and other southern states republicans who should be demanding immediate federal assistance to protect the elderly and the sick are holding this effort hostage to their political agenda
325439 over the past decade more than 400 arizonans have died from extreme heat including 31 in july of 2005
325440 arizona public service reported that there was a 36 percent increase in the number of households having difficulty in paying utility bills and an increase of 11 000 families being disconnected compared to a year ago
325441 its unclear to me why he would try to put so much effort trying to make other people look bad for voting against cloture
325442 frankly i think he looks bad for not being willing to tackle our energy problem
325443 was done with the cooperation of elements on the left
325444 from a historical perspective eta is very weak at an organisational level it is nothing compared with what it was 10 or 15 years ago

325469 the clinton turnout operation in manchester their strongest area was very good and turnout soared 33 over 2000 in rochester dover somersworth another strong clinton area turnout was up 94 from 2000
325470 i think just based on anecdotal evidence that clinton was able to connect with women voters who had been with her all along except for the last couple of weeks
325471 to show the people that the votes that were cast on election day were accurately reflected in the results and i have every confidence that will be the case
325472 it would not have been possible to satisfy voter concerns about the fairness of the election in these wards without the paper trail new hampshire has kept in place

325485 after this we are ordering dna tests for all children whose mothers present credible indications that they were abducted and we are asking parents of those two babies in the u s to voluntarily submit dna tests of their adoptive children
325486 these people are absolutely devastated absolutely horrified over the idea that a child was stolen from a mother
325487 there is grief over the loss of the child but absolute joy that the mother has been found
325488 maybe its because they saw i was vulnerable all alone in the shoe store
325489 that photograph kept me company during those terrible 14 months
325490 so far she has not fully adapted to me she pulls my hair bites and kicks me you have no idea how hard it is when your own child rejects you

325493 this statute does not provide any religious exemptions nor does it contemplate an exemption for the use of marijuana that would be consistent with public health and safety
325494 by imposing a total ban the legislature has deemed that the use and possession of marijuana always pose a risk to public health and welfare

325505 data protection is the number one concern of information security officers today with the acquisition of reconnex we look forward to redefine the data protection market by bringing together a leader and our comprehensive portfolio of data protection technologies we expect that this will enable us to leapfrog other data protection vendors and to reinforce our position as the largest dedicated security company
325506 we expect this acquisition to help mcafee solve the bigger tougher data protection problems inhibiting current dlp deployments and will result in tremendous opportunities for our collective customers and partners our technology helps businesses answer the two fundamental questions of what to protect and from whom
325507 as a joint customer of both the companies we believe the combination of their technologies will significantly benefit our network security operations managing our system network protection under one management console will provide us a more comprehensive view into our security infrastructure

325526 some of the records that we found showed that he was breeding these for sale in both san jose and san francisco
325527 it said rottweiler shepherd puppies shots had shots and then listed the phone number and said let it ring
325528 i thought it was strange that he didnt let us on to his property he just passed the puppy over the fence
325529 you could tell she wasnt socialized a lot as a puppy cause puppies are so happy going and she was shy and quiet
325530 i called him back about three months later to let him know that the dogs that he was breeding have genetic problems with their hips and he said at that time well what do you expect for 150
325531 its sad because i usually try and rescue animals and i kind of feel guilty for getting her from somebody who is breeding
325532 but i guess in the long run i actually ended up rescuing her in a sense too

325580 they needed a left fielder im going to play left field and i cant wait
325581 hes going to be our left fielder and hes right handed and hes going to hit in the middle of our order but he doesnt have to be mannys replacement
325582 i dont think thats fair to put on any player were not asking him to fill those shoes specifically were asking him to be a contributing member to a winning baseball team emphasis on the last word
325583 id been traded three times in the minor leagues before i got to pittsburgh albeit thats not the grand scale of this trade but i felt like i had been equipped somewhat to handle that i didnt know anything more than what everyone was writing i was following it just like everyone else was
325584 if i was a free agent i couldnt have picked a better place to go to
325585 from what everyone says about boston and having played here a couple of years ago in interleague the atmosphere and obviously the winning i couldnt have hand picked a better place
325586 it shall be known that in 2008 the world will be blessed
325587 barack obama may be the one but is he ready to lead
325588 senator mccain can keep telling everyone how proud he is of these political stunts which even his republican friends and advisors have called childish but barack obama will continue talking about his plan to jumpstart our economy by giving working families 1 000 dollars of immediate relief
325589 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
325590 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
325591 excuse me young man this is going to be a question and answer session so you can ask a question later
325592 why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african american community or black community in this country
325593 i think youre misinformed when you say not one time
325594 every issue that youve spoken about i actually did speak out of
325595 what i said was what i think everybody knows which is that i dont look like i came out of central casting when it comes to presidential candidates
325596 we underestimated the number of firewalls out there that were deployed in front of dns servers
325597 cisco juniper citrix and a number of other firewall vendors have been absolutely scrambling to update their equipment
325598 if you have a pat firewall the best thing you can do is look through our document understand how our network is configured and if you need the fix thats provided then install the fix
325599 but at least there are no more deniers out there muddying the waters with the overblown not urgent message
325600 las fine but it aint home new yorks home but it aint mine no more
325601 youre safe now young one no one will harm you
325602 but who are you where am i i dont understand
325603 the brother in humble circumstances ought to take pride in his high position
325604 lord please blast me so that i end up plastered to the floor
325605 but god has chosen the foolish things of the world to put to shame the wise and god has chosen the weak things of the world to put to shame the things which are mighty
325606 but you shall receive power when the holy spirit has come upon you

325642 good morning everyone this is miss x who will be monitoring your calls from la rochelle a town in france
325643 yes our prophet was a peaceful man and the muslims only got into fights when completely necessary in self defense and that they wold never attack just because sounds great huh let us see if that is real or not
325644 eu posso ver o lugar se a gente ao menos tivesse uma galho novamente
325645 deixe me encontrar o menino deixe me trazer lhe o potter eu sei que eu posso o encontrar meu senhor por favor
325646 eu n o estou entendendo voc voc teve uma performance magicamente extraordin ria com esta varinha
325647 eu tive minha usual performance m gica eu sou extraordin rio mas esta varinha n o ela n o revelou as maravilhas que prometeu eu n o senti diferen a desta varinha para a que eu obtive do olivaras a anos atr s
325648 eu estive pensando serio severus voc sabe por que eu o chamei de volta por tr s daquela batalha
325649 n o meu lorde mas eu imploro para deixar retornar deixe me encontrar potter
325650 voc soa como lucius nenhum de voc s compreende o potter como eu n o precisa encontr lo o potter vir para mim eu soube sua fraqueza voc v uma grande falha ele odiara assistir os outros sendo golpeados ao seu redor sabendo disto isso que acontece ele ira querer parar isto a todo custo ele vira
325651 mas meu lorde ele pode ser acidentalmente morto por algu m exce o de voc mesmo
325652 minhas instru es para os comensais foram perfeitamente entendidas capturar potter voc foi muito valioso a mim muito valioso
325653 meu lorde o senhor sabe que eu procuro lhe servir somente mas deixe me ir encontrar o garoto meu lorde2 deixe me traz lo para voc eu sei que consigo
325654 minha preocupa o no momento severus o que ir acontecer quando eu finalmente encontrar o garoto
325655 porque as duas varinhas que eu usei falharam quando apontadas para harry potter
325656 minha varinha de yew fez tudo que eu pedi severus com exce o de matar harry potter falhou duas vezes ollivander me disse sobre tortura sobre os n cleos g meos me disse para conseguir uma nova varinha eu o fiz mas a varinha de lucius se despeda ou quando se encontrou com potter
325657 eu eu n o tenho explica o para isso milorde
325658 eu procurei por uma terceira varinha severus a varinha anci a varinha do destino da morte eu a peguei do seu antigo dono eu a paguei do tumulo de alvo dumbledore
325659 ainda h uma longa noite eu estou na beira da vitoria eu estou sentado aqui
325660 me perguntando me perguntando porque a varinha anci ser o que ela deve se tornar se refusa a ser executada como a lenda descreve ela deve ser executada direito para o seu dono de direito e eu acho que eu tenho essa resposta
325661 a varinha anci n o pode me servir direito severus porque eu n o sou seu verdadeiro mestre a varinha anci pertence ao bruxo que matou seu ultimo dono voc matou alvo dumbledore enquanto voc viver severus a varinha anci n o pode ser verdadeiramente minha
325662 a mam e disse pra voc n o fazer isso
325663 mam e disse que n o permitido voc fazer isso l lian
325664 t nia olha isso v s o que eu posso fazer
325665 e o minist rio pode te punir se voc usar magia for a da escola voc recebe cartas
325666 n s n o temos problema n o temos nossas varinhas ainda eles n o pegam no seu p quando voc crian a e n o tem como controlar mas uma vez que voc fizer 11 anos a tem que ser mais cuidadoso
325667 isso verdade n n o uma brincadeira pet nia fica dizendo que voc est mentindo pra mim pet nia diz que n o existe uma hogwarts isso real n o
325668 n o para ela mas n s vamos receber a carta voc e eu
325669 mas voc nascida trouxa ent o algu m da escola ter de vir e explicar para seus pais
325670 eles n o v o te entregar para os dementadores por isso
325671 o que isso que voc est vestindo de qualquer forma
325672 ela pegou a m o de sua irm e segurou com firmeza mesmo que pet nia tentasse se soltar
325673 talvez uma vez que eu esteja l n o escute t nia
325674 voc acha que eu quero ir pra um castelo idiota e aprender a ser uma uma
325675 uma escola especial para aberra es voc e aquele menino dos snape bizarros isso que voc s s o bom que voc s sejam separados das pessoas normais para a nossa seguran a
325676 voc n o achava que era uma escola de aberra es quando escreveu para o diretor e implorou para ele aceit la
325677 aquele menino encontrou voc e aquele menino estavam espiando em meu quarto
325678 severo viu o envelope e ele n o podia acreditar que um trouxa pudesse ter contatado hogwarts s isso
325679 pet nia me odeia porque n s vimos a carta do dumbledore
325680 quem quer cair na sonserina eu acho que eu abandonaria voc n o
325681 talvez eu rompa com a tradi o para onde voc vai se puder escolher
325682 grifin ria onde se alojam os de bravo cora o como meu pai
325683 para onde voc espera ir uma vez que n o nenhum dos dois
325684 n s somos sev mas eu n o gosto das pessoas com quem voc est andando desculpe me mas eu detesto avery e mulciber mulciber o que voc v nele sev ele esquisito voc sabe o que ele tentou fazer com mary mcdonald outro dia
325685 e o que voc diz das coisas que potter e seus amigos to sempre aprontando
325686 eles escapam durante a noite tem algo estranho com esse lupin para onde ele vai sempre
325687 por que voc est t o obcecado com eles por que se importa com o que eles fazem durante a noite
325688 eu estava somente tentando mostrar a voc que eles n o s o t o maravilhosos quanto todos pensam que s o
325689 eu n o quis dizer eu apenas n o a quero ver saindo com um tolo ele gosta de voc james potter gosta de voc
325690 e ele n o todos pensam grande her i de quadribol
325691 eu sei que james potter um arrogante apanhador n o bem isso mas o sentido esse
325692 eu n o preciso que voc me fale isso mas a id ia de humor de mulciber e de avery diab lica diab lica sev eu n o entendo como voc pode ser amigos deles harry duvidou que snape sequer tenha ouvido as cr ticas dela a mulciber e avery no momento que ela insultou james potter seu corpo inteiro estava relaxado e enquanto eles caminhavam havia um novo salto no andar de snape e a cena se dissolveu harry observou novamente snape deixar o sal o principal ap s seus noms de defesa contra as artes das trevas e observou como ele vagueou para fora do castelo e sentou se inadvertidamente perto rvore onde james sirius lupin e pettigrew entavam sentados em baixo mas harry manteve dist ncia dessa vez porque ele sabia o que aconteceia depois james teria suspendido severus no ar e ridicularizado ele ele sabia o que havia sido feito e dito e n o lhe deu nenhum prazer ouvir isso novamente ele observou lily se juntar so grupo e sair em defesa de snape distante ele ouviu snape disparar nela sua humilha o e sua f ria a palavra imperdo vel sangue sujo
325693 eu somente vim aqui porque mary me disse que voc estava amea ando dormir aqui
325694 eu n o posso mais fingir voc escolheu o seu caminho e eu escolhi o meu
325695 me chamar de sangue ruim mas voc chama todos com linhagens iguais a minha de sangue ruim severus porque comigo seria diferente
325696 n o n o nenhuma mensagem vim aqui por conta pr pria
325697 eu venho aqui com um aviso n o mandado por voldemort por favor
325698 tudo tudo o que eu ouvi disse snape que porque por esta raz o ele pensa que se refere a l lian evans
325699 voc sabe o que significa ele pesou que significava seu filho ele est indo atr s dela vai mat los todos
325700 e se ela significa tanto para voc disse dumbledore talvez lorde voldemort a pouparia para voc voc n o poderia pedir em favor da m e em troca do filho
325701 voc n o se importa ent o com as morte do marido e do filho dela eles podem morrer se voc conseguir o que voc quer
325702 esconda todos eles ent o ele mantenha os a salvo por favor
325703 ela e thiago confiaram na pessoa errada disse dumbledore assim como voc severus voc n o esperava que lord voldemort iria poup la
325704 o filho dela vive ele tem os olhos dela voc lembra do brilho e da cor dos olhos de l lian evans eu penso
325705 se voc amava l lian evans ent o seu caminho a frente est limpo
325706 voc sabe como e porque ela foi morta fa a com que isso n o seja em v o me ajude a proteger o filho de l lian
325707 ele n o precisa de prote o agora que o lorde se foi
325708 o lorde das trevas vai retornar e harry potter vai estar em grande perigo quando isso acontecer
325709 muito bem muito bem mas nunca conte nada dumbledore isto deve ficar entre n s jure eu n o posso especialmente do filho do potter eu quero a sua palavra
325710 minha palavra severus de que eu nunca irei revelar o melhor de voc
325711 outros professores dizem que o garoto modesto am vel e razoavelmente talentoso pessoalmente eu acho ele uma crian a encantadora
325712 a marca de karkaroff est se tornando mais negra tamb m ele est em p nico ele teme retalia o voc sabe o quanto ele ajudou o minist rio depois da queda do lorde das trevas
325713 por que voc colocou aquele anel isto carrega uma maldi o com certeza voc sabia disso porque encostar nisso
325714 esse anel carregava uma maldi o de poder extraordin rio conte la tudo o q n s podemos fazer eu tranquei a maldi o em uma m o por um tempo
325715 voc fez muito bem severus quanto tempo voc acha que eu tenho
325716 eu n o posso dizer com certeza talvez um ano n o existe nada que segure um encantamento pra sempre eventualmente isso ira se soltar esse o efeito da magia com o tempo
325717 eu sou afortunado extremamente afortunado por que eu tenho voc severus
325718 se voc tivesse me chamado um pouco mais cedo eu poderia ter feito mais ganho mais tempo pra voc
325719 voc pensou que quebrar o anel quebraria a maldi o
325720 eu me refiro ao plano que lorde voldemort tem sobre mim o plano dele de mandar o pobre menino malfoy me matar
325721 o lorde das trevas n o espera que draco consiga isso apenas uma puni o pelas falhas recentes do lucius uma tortura lenta para os parentes do draco enquanto eles assistem ele falhar e pagar o pre o
325722 em resumo o garoto tem uma senten a de morte sobre ele assim como eu tenho
325723 agora eu devo eu devo presumir que o sucessor do trabalho caso draco falhe voc
325724 lorde voldemort enxerga um futuro pr ximo em que ele n o precisar de um espi o em hogwarts
325725 ele acredita que a escola vai estar logo sobre o seu comando sim
325726 bom agora sua maior prioridade ser descobrir o que draco est fazendo um adolescente assustado um perigo para os outros como para si mesmo ofere a ajuda e dire o ele deve aceitar ele gosta de voc
325727 muito menos depois que seu pai foi pego draco me culpa ele acha que eu roubei a posi o de lucius
325728 do mesmo modo eu estou menos preocupado comigo do que com as vitimas acidentais que podem ocorrer nas tentativas do garoto por ultimo claro existe apenas mais uma coisa que devemos fazer para livrar o garoto das garras do lorde voldemort
325729 ou gostaria de alguns momentos para compor um epit fio
325730 eu ouso dizer que o momento aparecer na hora certa levando em conta o que foi dito essa noite
325731 n s podemos estar certos de que acontecer dentro de um ano
325732 eu n o gostaria que se rasgasse por minha causa
325733 s voc sabe se feriria sua alma evitar que um velho homem sofra dor e humilha o
325734 eu pe o esse grande favor a voc severo porque minha morte est pr xima t o certa quanto o fato de que os chudley cannons ficar o no fundo da liga eu confesso que eu preferiria uma sa da r pida e indolor ao caso bagun ado e alongado que seria se greyback estivesse envolvido por exemplo eu ouvi que voldemort esteve recrutando ele ou a querida bellatrix que gosta de jogar com a comida antes de com la
325735 o que voc tem feito com o potter todas essas noites em que voc s est o juntos
325736 por qu voc n o est tentando dar lhe mais deten es severo logo o garoto ter gasto mais tempo com deten es do que fora delas
325737 nos olhos talvez mas em sua natureza mais profunda muito mais como sua m e eu gasto o tempo com harry porque eu tenho coisas a discutir com ele informa o que eu devo lhe dar antes que seja tarde de mais
325738 isso n o quest o de confian a eu tenho como voc deve saber tempo limitado essencial que eu d ao menino informa o para ele fazer o que necessita fazer
325739 e porque eu n o posso ter a mesma informa o
325740 eu prefiro n o colocar meus segredos em uma nica cesta particularmente n o numa cesta que gasta muito tempo arriscando se no c rculo do lorde das trevas
325741 e voc o faz extremamente bem n o pense que eu n o estimo o perigo constante em que voc se coloca severo para dar a voldemort o que aparenta ser valiosa informa o enquanto ret m o essencial um trabalho que eu n o confiaria a ningu m a n o ser a voc
325742 contudo voc confia muito mais em um garoto que incapaz de utilizar a oclum ncia cuja m gica med ocre e que tem direto conex o com a mente do lorde das trevas
325743 n o foi h muito tempo atr s que ele teve uma pequena prova do que significa de verdade compartilhar a sua mente com a do harry significa foi uma dor tal como ele nunca experimentou tenho certeza de que n o tentar possuir harry outra vez n o dessa maneira
325744 a alma de lorde voldemort dividida como n o pode ter contato com uma alma como a do harry como se a l ngua estivesse grudada em uma chapa de metal congelada como se a carne estivesse em chamas
325745 no caso de harry e lorde voldemort falar de uma coisa falar da outra
325746 voc se recusa dizer a mim qualquer coisa contudo voc espera esse pequeno servi o de mim
325747 voc conta com muita coisa dumbledore talvez eu tenha mudado de id ia
325748 venha ao meu escrit rio est noite severo s onze e voc n o se queixar que eu n o tenho nenhuma confian a em voc
325749 harry n o deve saber n o at o ltimo momento n o at que esteja necess rio se n o como poderia ter a for a para fazer o que deve ser feito
325750 isto entre o harry e eu escute com aten o severo vir logo ap s a minha morte n o discuta n o interrompa vir uma poca em que lorde voldemort temer pela vida de sua serpente
325751 precisamente se vier uma poca em que lorde voldemort parar de colocar essa serpente para suas oferendas e passar a mant la segura do lado dele sob prote o m gica ent o eu penso que ser seguro dizer a harry
325752 dizer a ele que na noite em que voldemort tentou mat lo quando lily colocou sua pr pria vida entre eles como um escudo a maldi o da morte se voltou para lorde voldemort e um fragmento de sua alma foi separada do resto e se alojou na nica alma viva naquele local uma parte de lorde voldemort vive dentro de harry e isso que d a ele o poder de falar com as cobras e uma conex o com a mente de lorde voldemort a qual ele nunca entendeu e enquanto esse fragmento de alma perdido por voldemort continuar atado e protegido em harry lorde voldemort n o pode morrer
325753 e o pr prio voldemort deve fazer isso severo isso essencial
325754 eu pensei depois de todos esses anos que n s est vamos protegendo ele por ela por lily
325755 voc tem ajudado a proteger o garoto afinal de contas
325756 que eles usem a po o polissuco id nticos potters isso somente uma coisa para voc fazer voc esquecer que eu tenha sugerido isto voc apresentar esta id ia como sua pr pria id ia voc entendeu
325757 podia ter como amigo algu m como gellert grindelwal eu penso que ele mentia montes de amor lily
325758 agora severus a espada n o se esque a que isso tem que ser dado em condi es de precis o e valor e ele n o pode saber que voc levou a ele se voldemort poder ler a mente de harry e ver voc ajudando ele
325759 e voc n o vai me contar por que t o importante entregar a espada para o potter
325760 ele saber o que fazer com isso e severus tenha muito cuidado eles n o v o aceitar uma apari o sua depois da orelha de george weasley
325761 harry voc n o est pensando em entregar se est
325762 a venerabilidade daquela possibilidade o sufocou por um momento fez o poss vel para continuar falando
325763 a t tulo de preven o eles est o ocupados e voc torna se a possibilidade
325764 mais r pido e mais f cil que cair no sono
325765 l ogo depois de voc ter tido seu filho remo sinto muito
325766 sinto muito que nunca v conhec lo mas ele saber porque eu morri e espero que ele entenda eu estava tentando fazer um mundo em que ele pudesse viver uma vida mais feliz
325767 daquele caso principal em que hagrid guardou um ramo inteiro do material aqui dentro
325768 quase em cima do tempo o potter teve a sua hora ele n o est vindo
325769 n o n o n o vai ficar calado e quieto
325770 gritou rowle e com uma chicotada da sua varinha hagrid foi silenciado
325771 voc um garoto maravilho voc bravo um homem vamos conversar
325772 isto por uma pergunta n o em todo meu caro garoto eu acho que n o
325773 bem eu acho teve ter feito toda a diferen a
325774 ent o a parte da alma dele que estava em mim
325775 dumbledore acenou ainda mais entusiasmado incentivando harry a prosseguir um largo sorriso encorajador seu rosto
325776 e ningu m morreu por mim deste vez como eu posso estar vivo
325777 pense lembre o que ele fez em sua ignor ncia sua raiva e sua crueldade
325778 ele usou seu sangue e reconstruiu seu corpo com ele seu sangue nas veias dele harry a prote o de lilian dentro de voc s dois ele limitou voc a viver enquanto ele vivesse
325779 eu vivo enquanto ele vive mas eu pensei eu pensei que fosse ao contr rio eu achei que n s dois ter amos que morrer ou a mesma coisa
325780 voc foi o s timo horcrux harry horcrux que ele nunca pensou fazer ele tinha dado a sua alma t o movedi a que ele estalou parte quando ele cometeu aqueles atos de maldade inexprim vel o assassinato dos seus pais a matan a de tantas crian as mas o que escapou daquela sala foi at menos do que ele sabia ele partiu mais do que o seu corpo atr s ele deixou a parte dele trancada em voc a suposta v tima que tinha sobrevivido
325781 ele tomou o seu sangue acreditando que o fortaleceria ele tomou no seu corpo uma parte muito pequena do encantamento que sua m e postou sobre voc quando ela morreu por voc o seu corpo guarda o sacrif cio vivo e enquanto aquele encantamento sobrevive faz uma esperan a ltima de voldemort para ele
325782 e voc sabia isto voc sabia desde o in cio
325783 o que voc deve entender harry que voc e o lorde voldemort viajaram em conjunto em reinos da magia at aqui desconhecida e n o testada
325784 penso que podemos aceitar que voc n o est morto embora naturalmente
325785 n o minimizo os seus sofrimentos que estou seguro foram severos
325786 como a esta o da cruz do rei exceto um l quido de limpeza vazio e n o h nenhum trem pelo que eu possa ver
325787 o meu caro rapaz n o tenho nenhuma id ia isto como eles dizem a sua partida
325788 sem significar como voc agora saiba lorde voldemort dobrou o la o entre voc quando ele voltou a uma forma humana uma parte da alma dele ainda foi prendida a sua e pensando se fortalecer ele levou uma parte do sacrif cio de sua m e nele
325789 assegurado esta conex o dos dois dobra depois de ter embrulhado seus destinos junto mais com firmeza que j foram unidos dois feiticeiros em hist ria voldemort errou ao atacar com uma varinha que compartilhou o mesmo n cleo com sua
325790 ele tinha mais medo que voc era aquela noite harry
325791 eu acredito que sua vara absorveu alguns dos poderes e qualidades da varinha de voldemort essa noite que dizer que conteve um pouco do pr prio voldemort
325792 mas se minha varinha fosse t o poderosa como da hermione p de quebrar isto
325793 meu querido menino eu n o tenho nenhuma id ia isto como dizem eles sua festa
325794 voc pode me perdoar por n o confiar em voc por n o lhe falar eu s temi que voc falhasse como eu tinha falhado eu s pensava que voc cometeria meus erros eu almejo seu perd o harry eu soube de algum tempo para c que voc o homem melhor
325795 harry perguntou assustado pelo tom de dumbledore pelas l grimas s bitas nos olhos dele
325796 e eu era tal um bobo mas voc sabe n o o fa a eu n o tenho nenhum segredo mais de voc voc sabe
325797 claro que como voc pode perguntar isso voc nunca matou se voc pudesse evitar isto
325798 ele foi a coisa antes de mais nada que nos juntou
325799 dois rapazes inteligentes arrogantes com uma obsess o compartilhada ele quis vir cova de godric como estou seguro que voc adivinhou por causa da sepultura de ignotus peverell ele quis explorar o lugar em que o terceiro irm o tinha morrido
325800 a capa como voc sabe a gora viajou atrav s dos anos de pai para filho m e para filha at chegar no ltimo descendente vivo de ignotus que nasceu assim como ignotus na vila de godrics hollow
325801 voc voc adivinhou eu sei por que a capa estava em minha posse na noite em que seus pais morreram tiago mostrara ela pra mim apenas alguns dias antes de morrer isso explica muito das coisas erradas qeu ele fez na escola sem ser percebido eu mal podia acreditar no que estava vendo eu a pedi emprestada para examin la passou muito tempo depois que eu desisti de meu sonho de unir as rel quias mas eu n o pude resistir n o pude olhar com mais cuidado era uma capa de um tipo que eu jamais vi imensamente velha perfeita em cada item e ent o seu pai morreu e eu tinha duas rel quias afinal todas para mim
325802 a capa n o os teria ajudado a sobreviver de qualquer modo
325803 voldemort sabia onde minha m e e meu pai estavam a capa n o poderia t los feito invenc veis frente aos feiti os
325804 ent o voc desistira de procurar as rel quias quando viu a capa
325805 voc sabe o que aconteceu voc sabe voc n o pode me desprezar mais do eu desprezo a mim mesmo
325806 voc sabe o segredo da sa de de minha irm o que aqueles trouxas fizeram o que ela se tornou voc sabe como meu pr prio pai buscou vingan a e pagou o pre o morreu em voc sabe como minha m e desistiu da pr pria vida para cuidar de ariana
325807 eu era soluto eu era brilhante eu queria escapar queria brilhar queria gl ria
325808 ent o quando minha m e morreu foi deixada comigo a responsabilidade sobre uma irm doente e um irm o genioso eu retornei a minha vila com raiva e amargo
325809 grindelwald voc n o pode imaginar como suas id ias me cativaram harry me inflamaram trouxas for ados em subservi ncia n s magos triunfantes grindelwald e eu os gloriosos jovens l deres da revolu o
325810 e no cora o de nossos planos as rel quias mortais
325811 mestres invenc veis da morte grindelwald e dumbledore dois meses de insanidades de sonhos cru is e de neglig ncias aos dois membros de minha fam lia que me restavam
325812 e depois voc sabe o que aconteceu a realidade tomou a forma de meu rude desletrado e infinitamente mais admir vel irm o eu n o queria ouvir as verdades que ele gritava para mim eu n o queria ouvir que eu n o podia sair e perseguir rel quias com uma inst vel e fraca irm no colo
325813 a discuss o virou uma briga grindelwald perdeu o controle controle que eu sempre tinha sentido nele mesmo que eu fingisse que n o agora tornado um ser terr vel e ariana ap s todos os cuidados de minha m e cai morta no ch o
325814 bem grindelwald voou como todos exceto eu podiam ter predito
325815 anos passaram se havia rumores sobre ele diziam que ele procurava uma varinha de poder imenso eu enquanto isso tinha recebido a oferta do cargo de ministro da magia n o uma mas v rias vezes naturalmente eu recusei eu aprendi que n o devia ser confiado com poder
325816 mas voc teria sido melhor muito melhor que fudge ou scrimgeour
325817 voc muito gentil harry mas enquanto eu eu mesmo com o treinamento de magos jovens grindelwald levantava um ex rcito eles dizem que ele me temeu e possivelmente ele o fez mas menos penso do que o temi
325818 penso que ele o sabia penso que ele sabia o que me assustou atrasei a reuni o at ele finalmente teria sido demasiado vergonhoso resistir mais tempo as pessoas morriam e ele parecia imbat vel e tive de fazer o que eu poderia
325819 bem voc sabe o que aconteceu depois ganhei o duelo ganhei a varinha
325820 grindelwald tentou parar voldemort depois com a varinha ele mentido voc sabe fingiu que ele nunca a tinha tido
325821 eles dizem que ele mostrou o remorso anos depois sozinho na sua c lula em nurmengard
325822 fui tolo harry depois de todos aqueles anos eu n o tinha aprendido nada fui indigno para unir me com as rel quias mortais eu tinha o comprovado repetidas vezes e aqui esteve a prova final
325823 foi natural voc quis v los novamente o que h errado com isso
325824 talvez um homem em um milh o pode unir as rel quias harry era cab vel s possuir os mais avaros deles menos extraordin rio era cab vel possuir a varinha mais velha e n o e n o matar com ela fui permitido dom lo e us lo porque o tomei n o para o lucro mas salvar outros dele
325825 mas a capa tomei fora do campo de vis o e portanto ele nunca pode ter trabalhado para mim como ele trabalha para voc os seus propriet rios verdadeiros o pomo eu teria usado em uma tentativa de arrastar para tr s aqueles que s o em paz antes que permitir o meu pr prio sacrif cio como voc fez voc o possessor digno de rel quia
325826 por que voc teve de faz lo t o dif cil
325827 temo que eu contei com a senhorita granger para diminuir voc harry
325828 n o penso assim porque ele n o reconheceu o pomo da ressurrei o que ele converteu em um horcrux
325829 estive seguro que ele tentaria depois que a sua varinha bateu em voldemort no cemit rio de little hangleton
325830 se voc planejou a sua morte com snape voc pensou em terminar com a varinha mais velha n o
325831 estamos na cruz do rei que voc diz penso que se voc decidiu n o voltar voc seria capaz de digamos pegar um trem
325832 que se voc decidir voltar h uma possibilidade que isto pode ser terminado para sempre n o posso promet lo mas sei disto harry que voc tem menos para temer se voltar aqui do que ele
325833 n o se compade a dos mortos harry compade a se da vida e antes de mais nada daqueles que vivem sem amor voltando voc pode assegurar que menos almas ser o mutiladas menos fam lias ser o rasgadas se lhe parece um objetivo digno vamos adeus por enquanto
325834 isto verdadeiro ou isto esteve acontecendo dentro da minha cabe a
325835 naturalmente est acontecendo dentro da sua cabe a harry mas por que que isto deveria significar que n o verdadeiro

325858 snape pertencia a dumbledore de dumbledore no momento em que voc come ou a ca ar a minha m e e voc nunca percebeu porque era um a coisa que voc n o podia entender voc nunca viu snape lan ar um patrono viu riddle
325859 o mesmo que o da minha m e porque ele a amou por praticamente toda sua vida desde que eles eram crian as voc deveria ter percebido
325860 ele pediu para voc poupar a vida dela n o pediu
325861 mas quando ela se foi ele concordou que haveria outra mulher uma de puro sangue digna dele
325862 mas ele era o espi o de dumbledore desde o momento que voc a amea ou e ele binha trabalhando contra voc desde ent o dumbledore j estava morrendo quando snape o matou
325863 n o importa se snape era meu ou de dumbledore ou que pat ticos obst culos eles tentaram colocar no meu caminho eu os esmaguei como esmaguei sua m e o suposto grande amor de snape oh mas tudo faz sentido potter em jeitos que voc n o entenderia
325864 dumbledore estava tentando manter a varinha anci longe de mim ele pretendia que snape fosse o verdadeiro mestre da varinha mas eu a consegui antes que voc a pequena varinha anci a varinha da morte a varinha do destino verdadeiramente minha o ltimo plano de dumbledore saiu errado harry potter
325865 porque o ultimo plano de dumbledore n o saiu pela culatra de jeito n o saiu pela culatra com voc riddle
325866 a varinha ainda n o est funcionando direito pra voc porque voc assassinou a pessoa errada severus snape nunca foi o verdadeiro meste da varinha anci ele nunca derrotou dumbledore
325867 voc n o estava ouvindo snape nunca derrotou dumbledore a morte de dumbledore foi planejada entre eles dumbledore pretendia morrer vitorioso como o ultimo verdadeiro mestre da varinha se tudo tivesse sa do como ele havia planejado o poder da varinha teria morrido com ele porque ningu m nunca havia ganhado dele

325907 ms couillard may have put herself in jeopardy of having contravened a provision of the security of information act
325908 its a report done at the request of mr bernier for the benefit of mr bernier so im not surprised that the interpretations of these people went in that direction
325909 it has to be acknowledged that the incident itself was injurious to tarnishing canadas good reputation within nato circles for safeguarding classified information
325910 there was no occasion or reason for mr bernier to open his briefcase and he does not have any recollection of opening it during his stay at ms couillards
325911 the fact that they didnt interview ms couillard means that the report is frankly useless

325971 i dont think it will be very long that theyll allow him to do that be without a lawyer
325972 he was just such an amazing guy he had a great personality

325994 the market is going to be soft for a couple of years
325995 while there is much uncertainty we expect weak economic growth and soft u s lodging demand to persist into 2009
325996 but the fact remains that the city and the state put money into the expanded convention center and you do not have enough rooms in town to fully utilize the center
325997 in order to book the convention center youve got to have the hotel rooms first in the long term it should increase lodging demand in the city because the city will be able to handle large groups

326028 eso demuestra que la gente siempre ha estado preocupada por esto no hay sino que ver los escritos de erasmo de rotterdam leonardo da vinci miguel ngel maquiavelo o miguel de cervantes en el quijote todos hacen alguna alusi n
326029 manejar la buena educaci n es un elogio a la sencillez
326030 nada peor que una pierna desnuda en un contexto de empresa
326031 los miembros de una organizaci n deben pensar en la responsabilidad de llevar encima una marca y eso se refleja en el saludo las presentaciones la capacidad de conciliar de hacer una observaci n en el contexto privado en conocer al equipo de trabajo descubrir las competencias de cada uno y en generar espacios para contribuir al mejoramiento en las debilidades
326032 un h bito que bien manejado le permite agradar a los dem s solamente con su forma de comportarse ante cualquier circunstancia de la vida diaria con la sutileza de las expresiones que usa y a n con la forma como luce la mayor expresi n de la etiqueta est en los encuentros con los dem s en lo que denominamos comportamiento social
326033 no estar amos dispuestos a aceptar una modificaci n de los compromisos asumidos por el presidente lvaro uribe
326034 hemos visto casos en los que se paga el 30 por ciento del valor establecido sobre la tabla de fletes
326035 los efectos son inmediatos y ya comenzaron a sentirse en las exportaciones del grano
326036 vamos a centrarnos en usar nuestros recursos y nuestra voz para situar los ahorros de nuevo en la agenda mundial
326037 es un asunto m s complejo cuando empiezas a analizarlo
326038 lo innovador independientemente de lo deportivo es lo que se est viendo en la parte m dica para personas que tienen imposibilidad de movimiento
326039 los vestidos de ba o para los mundiales de nataci n tienen un tejido tan liviano y la vez tan fuerte que mantiene el volumen del cuerpo y aligera el movimiento en el agua estos cuentan con lycra fibrorresistente para que las prendas no pierdan la forma despu s del uso
326040 en un futuro ser n casi una segunda piel y unido a los cuidados de la mujer que hace deporte vienen telas con microc psulas que liberan part culas que hidratan y reafirman la piel que en ltimas es la inspiradora de estas propuestas tecnol gicas
326041 siempre se ha buscado optimizar su rendimiento a trav s de prendas solo hay que ver la historia de adi dassler creador de adidas quien desde los a os 20 empez a estudiar las necesidades de los atletas para ofrecerles beneficios objetivo que se hizo realidad en la marca en 1948
326042 estas fibras se ubican de manera estrat gica seg n la actividad y se encuentran en materiales como el poli ster el polialgod n y las lycras
326043 nos preocupa la generaci n de basura y c mo manejarla la exagerada extracci n de especies aut ctonas como pulpos y langostas para atender a los turistas y el impacto en la vida cultural y econ mica de las comunidades dice u
326044 los procesos de acumulaci n las diferenciaciones sociales la ostentaci n sobretodo entre los m s j venes
326045 nunca debe obviarse el desayuno es imprescindible ofrecerle al menos una bebida l ctea acompa ada de una fruta o un cereal con leche y en estos casos aprovechar la lonchera para complementar los nutrientes que dej de recibir en ese momento
326046 la lonchera influye en el estado nutricional del ni o y en sus h bitos alimentarios de all que su valor nutritivo debe ser ptimo
326047 el yogur es una buena alternativa sin embargo hay que vigilar su composici n nutricional en la etiqueta de manera que el porcentaje mayor de calor as no sea dado por grasa
326048 cambian de aspecto y no se ver n agradables a la hora de consumirlas
326049 como tienen que estar refrigerados deben consumirse en las dos horas siguientes a la ruptura de la cadena de fr o pero a veces los ni os no los consumen al momento adecuado y al estar tanto tiempo a temperatura ambiente pueden ser perjudiciales
326050 por qu se ofrecen a los creadores tantas oportunidades y nosotros no tenemos ninguna
326051 en colombia entre 1993 y 2005 el d ficit cualitativo de vis unidades de baja calidad pas de 2 6 a 2 5 millones de hogares adem s se edificaron 152 000 viviendas en el 2007 mientras en el 2008 se est n formando 284 000 hogares
326052 en este momento no hay un estudio detallado de las cifras a nivel nacional por eso la idea es hacer un an lisis por regi n que permita evaluar qu se debe hacer para solucionar cada caso
326053 cada a o estamos dejando de atender 12 000 familias que se van acumulando as para solucionar las necesidades de los nuevos hogares en los pr ximos 10 a os solamente en bogot deber amos construir 67 000 vis por a o
326054 luego de la misi n para conocer la realidad mexicana identificamos las estrategias que les han permitido cambiar la escala de producci n que es hoy es el gran reto para colombia
326055 el trabajo est en realizar una din mica nacional para producir unidades masivamente pues d nde se va a edificar si no hay suelo
326056 el problema de la vivienda es un problema de territorio no es un problema aislado por eso para lograr el objetivo debemos realizar macroproyectos concentrados
326057 hay una gran paradoja porque si bien el pa s cuenta con grandes recursos para alimentar la demanda y un crecimiento importante de cr ditos a n no se ve al constructor como el elemento esencial para promover la vis
326058 algunos de los entes territoriales no se han dado cuenta de que la nica forma para que el constructor invierta en este tipo de vivienda es no generarle externalidades que hagan que sus inversiones se destinen para otros usos m s rentables
326059 sin lugar a dudas los factores coyunturales de los entornos internacional y local han empezado a afectar la percepci n que los compradores de vivienda tienen en el momento de tomar la decisi n
326060 el aumento en la tasa de inter s de intervenci n que realiz recientemente el banco de la rep blica afecta al mercado hipotecario pues esto se traduce en mayores tasas de inter s de los cr ditos
326061 esperamos que la confianza de los consumidores contin e en niveles favorables en lo que resta de a o
326062 pero creo que con el tiempo confiar n m s en nosotros
326063 si no tuvi ramos la autopista que hace que nuestra industria puerto y astillero sean accesibles seguramente ya se habr an apagado las luces en wismar
326064 la autopista ha marcado una gran diferencia en la regi n incluso si a algunas reas no les va tan bien como a otras
326065 wismar se ha convertido en un centro de importaci n producci n y exportaci n de madera en el norte de europa y eso es algo de lo que la ciudad debe estar orgullosa
326066 uno necesita tener xito y necesita tener xito r pido para reducir las dudas sobre las medidas adoptadas

326068 two holes just werent my friend i did the best i could
326069 i knew i needed to make a couple birdies and i thought i could
326070 i left myself a really hard shot and just got underneath it
326071 and then i left myself a really hard fourth shot as well my fifth shot was against the grain i had unfortunate lies on all three of them
326072 i felt i grinded really well on the front nine today and i played steady on the back nine
326073 it was just two holes that got me into trouble
326074 the common view of cohabitation as a steppingstone to marriage needs to be seriously questioned

326079 the companies agreed to reduce this carcinogenic chemical in fried potatoes a victory for public health and safety in california
326080 other companies should follow this lead and take steps to reduce acrylamide in french fries and potato chips
326081 there is so much premeditation and deliberation in this case it is astonishing
326082 im gonna use it put your head on the end of a pike
326083 you have to look at the whole picture and just not isolate a little event
326084 the injury is there the injury is real the injury exists
326085 are they stupid enough not to see that i am a chemist not a biologist
326086 were talking about situations where the animals in question are receiving very little in the way of veterinary care
326087 you cant have an animal producing antibodies without having it in a terribly deteriorating condition
326088 ive not held a mouse in my hand my whole life
326089 i would be glad if they want to inquire about it directly rather than printing a threatening message and scaring my family
326090 dont they realize that it is just a kind of terrorism
326091 i remain committed to crafting language that provides an additional tool for law enforcement to protect researchers and their families who have and continue to be targeted by extremist organizations
326092 the legislature needs to send a message that violence or threats of violence are not acceptable
326093 it just happened that way at the end of the day im sitting there waiting for
326094 one idea is to have djs remix the same song or take four songs and get them to remix them
326095 another thing i want to do is to include one member from each of the bands whove won and together write a larger piece of music there will be 24 different winners by the new year
326096 did you have crowns in australia in the uk in my day they only had half crowns 2 6
326097 tampons you dont need to know im not shopping for things i know nothing about exchange

326100 no police not here get in the car you are ali baba
326101 ali baba ali baba and the forty thieves i think hes calling me a thief
326102 there was never a compelling offer put on the table
326103 were thrilled to be able to feature these pictures in people
326104 delighted that all proceeds from these stunning images will once again be donated entirely to charity
326105 youll hear from my opponent sen obama tomorrow and if its one thing he delivers its a great speech
326106 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as good as his rhetoric and this is especially true in the case of the urban leagues agenda of opportunity
326107 after decades of hearing the same big promises from the public education establishment and seeing the same results surely its time to shake off old ways and demand new reforms
326108 all that may go over well with the teachers unions but where does it leave families and their children who are stuck in failing schools
326109 my opponent talks a great deal about change but if he continues to defer to the teachers union instead of looking for real reform he should start looking for new slogans
326110 and for millions of families individuals and small businesses it means a lot less money to spend save and invest as they see fit
326111 it showed he was willing to make himself uncomfortable to hear what people had to say
326112 this was a nonsense speech a photo op for his candidacy it wasnt about us it was about the people in who helped take the election away from al gore in 2000 so this was the perfect place for him to bamboozle and run game
326113 i was happy he came and i was prepared to hear answers to some hard questions but i was disappointed
326114 he did not give one direct answer to questions on gun laws or the penal system
326115 i was disappointed to hear his views on affirmative action
326116 an association that means more to me than any other
326117 it was the same washington political speech weve heard from him
326118 but at least marc morial got the promise that he would come to next years convention in chicago and he said he would keep the leagues 100 th celebration at the white house
326119 i want people to know hes always been a very dangerous man hes a maniac
326120 he seemed to be a pest a sad case he had no social skills his conversation and dress sense were weird he certainly didnt look like any young man i knew
326121 even so i was about 500 yards from my mums house it was early evening and i thought no harm could possibly come to me
326122 i didnt know what had hit me he didnt say anything he just pinned me in the corner pulling my arm up my back i was screaming for my life but no one heard
326123 he put his hand over my nose and mouth and i couldnt breathe i thought i was going to die the next thing i knew he had my jeans undone when he started to rape me i felt sick
326124 he had gargantuan strength im 5ft 8ins well built and fit but i couldnt fight him off
326125 then he let me go said im sorry and ran off can you believe he apologised
326126 i was determined not to remain a victim i was angry that this man had done this to me
326127 i cried that night but then didnt cry again until i heard hed been charged with jill dandos murder he was not going to ruin my life
326128 i defy anyone not to make the decision i made i wanted the whole thing over with i was sitting my finals the following week and my wedding was planned for four months later
326129 he didnt look at me once i watched him being led down to the cells and thought good hes off the streets
326130 i honestly thought he would be rehabilitated in prison it was good to actually see justice being done i felt i had done my bit
326131 this guy raped me but was he really capable of blowing someones head off on their doorstep it beggared belief
326132 i was angry that despite what happened to me barry george had been left alone no one had seen the signs or done anything about it
326133 i have seen george portrayed as some kind of harmless eccentric but he is far from benign
326134 he knows how to work the system and look like a sad case i think he always craved notoriety
326135 this person really frightened me when he followed me each time i turned around to challenge him he just stared at me
326136 i was petrified i quickly walked towards my house and shouted to my mum i was frightened as he knew where i lived
326137 you remind me of a child in a womans body
326138 i felt his eyes burning into me he was sinister but then he scarpered on his bike
326139 it never works in the present but it will work in some far off mythical moment that never comes
326140 ill bet tyler has never heard of insert name of religion and if only tyler just heard the basic teachings of insert name of religion explained to him as if he is a shallow 13 year old boy he would see all the benefits it could bring to his life and thus joyfully convert worshiping meditating shrinking heads in the name of insert preferred object of reverence and become one of us
326141 tyler the other day when i asked you you said that your parents do not practice the same religion
326142 heres a push up bra five pounds of make up and some heals now make sure you come right home after school
326143 oh my god what in the hell is going on
326144 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date
326145 the government is only a minority shareholder in this publicly listed company so the board has quite rightly overall responsibility to all of the shareholders to try to find the right way forward
326146 ensure that what emerges from this situation is in the long term public interest for secure and sustainable energy not short term shareholder profit
326147 we do not have the luxury of time failure to act now will result in huge problems over the next 10 years with the uk reliant on imported gas and oil a situation that would be an environmental economic and political disaster
326148 despite the likelihood that the rumours contributed to the fall in the share price the fsa has not uncovered evidence that they were spread as part of a concerted attempt by individuals to profit by manipulating the share price
326149 there is no doubt that false and damaging rumours were circulating about hbos on 19 march 2008 and these would have had some impact on hbos share price
326150 it is difficult however to say how much impact as the share price was also affected by the interaction of a number of other complex factors on the day
326151 theres been some misinterpretation concerning our response to the street view suit it should not be interpreted as a blanket statement on our views towards privacy to be clear google respects an individuals right to privacy we have privacy protections built into all of our products for example we blur faces in street view and we offer easy to use removal tools so users can decide for themselves whether or not they want a given image to appear in street view it is unfortunate the parties involved opted to pursue litigation instead of making use of these tools
326152 we made the error of photographing the approach road to a military base in the us
326153 hes just a good man to have around the team
326154 everyone knows ive been under pressure out there so it was nice to go out there and get the hundred
326155 ive been feeling the pressure its as simple as that
326156 professional sport is a tough industry when youre not doing your job and as a batsman youve got to go out and score runs and i havent been doing that
326157 of course i came under pressure but today was one of those situations when i go out there and be aggressive in my strokeplay and it came off today today was my day
326158 the photographer had to be evicted wayne was happy to co operate fully and to give a clear version of the events in which he believes he was blameless
326159 i would rather have a player who showed a bit of heart than just accepted it
326160 and were sure this is the best thing for our family right
326161 o rest ye brother mariners we will not wander more
326162 hey guys its good to reach out to you again through my official facebook page this is where you can catch up on whats been going on with me during the off season see ya later lbj
326163 i think its a culmination of obviously frustrating moments individually and team wise
326164 im not going into a ton of details but i certainly regretted it immediately afterward
326165 i think that played a big factor and being frustrated it was a pretty impulsive thing it was a pretty quick thing not too much thought behind it
326166 as for the notion in the whitewashing article under discussion that
326167 on arab tv i once saw a muslim preacher telling little children that lying is not allowed except under three conditions 1 lying to non muslims when it is in the best interest of islam
326168 lying thus has become an obligation in international relationships muslim relationships and family relationships
326169 by allowing lying muslims have created a culture unable to distinguish between lies from truth truth has become a convoluted game of saving face for the best interest of islam
326170 i was happy to return to the us on the evening of sept 10th 2001 the next morning i saw the second airplane hit the twin towers i knew jihad has come to america muhammad attah was from cairo the same city i came from
326171 i called several friends in cairo they were all in denial and said how dare you say that arabs did this dont you know this is a jewish conspiracy
326172 these were not radicals but ordinary egyptians who otherwise are very nice people
326173 i hung up the phone and felt alone and disconnected from my culture of origin
326174 once again my people are accusing the jewish people of something we know very well we arabs have done ourselves
326175 kromberg argued to the jury that timimi and the other muslim witnesses their testimony should be disregarded just on the basis of their religion
326176 i think its an outrageous thing to argue in the courtroom
326177 i spoke to her like three or four times a day
326178 i had no idea she would do something like that and when police called and told me she had 45 pounds of marijuana i was in shock i couldnt believe it
326179 its hard to say whether she had the money or shes had this connection before and she has the ability to go and pick up dope and bring it here
326180 the dccc recognizes that this district is ready for change and im the candidate who will deliver that change

326182 powerex se alza como justa ganadora de esta comparativa con un producto de alto rendimiento y precio adecuado lo m s destacable sin duda es que aunque tarda varios ciclos de descarga en alcanzar su capacidad m xima cuando lo hacen llegan incluso a mejorar los datos que recogen sus especificaciones adem s al venir pre cargadas ya en el primer ciclo ofrecen una capacidad notable
326183 animamos a los periodistas a que informen y denuncien los desmanes medioambientales porque sin su ayuda no podremos cambiar las cosas
326184 el absurdo es evidente pero es imposible luchar contra ello porque no te pagan por hacer las cosas bien y mejorarlas sino por ser correcto y disciplinado

326189 honestly we hate it when this s happens because we want our fans to have any new songs first
326190 reality a lot of my thinking on this subject was shaped in a seminar i took with in grad school with
326191 the majority of bloggers and internet addicts like the endless rows of talking heads on television do not report
326192 they are largely parasites who cling to traditional news outlets they rarely pick up the phone much less go out and find a story nearly all reporting i would guess at least 80 percent is done by newspapers and the wire services take that away and we have a huge black hole
326193 customs agents must have the ability to conduct even highly intrusive searches when there is reason to suspect criminal or terrorist activity but suspicionless searches of americans laptops and similar devices go too far congress should not allow this gross violation of privacy
326194 these examinations are part of cbps long standing practice and are essential to uncovering vital law enforcement information
326195 spared from the storm masterworks from the new orleans museum of art
326196 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
326197 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
326198 im all for politicians changing their opinions when facts change but what is the fact that has changed exactly between yesterday and today
326199 gang of 10 it could also be as she notes he saw that the republicans were headed to the mattresses on drilling and decided to toss nancy pelosi into the crowded undercarriage of his bus

326219 the worst is over in the financial crisis or will be very soon
326220 i say that the lesson to be learned here is that we have been betrayed by congress again and again as it screws up everything it touches which is what government routinely does which is why it is obvious that the constitution never meant for them to be doing this

326274 i am disappointed we thought it was a good deal edf is the worlds largest nuclear operator it would have been a sensible way to take forward new nuclear plans in the uk that wasnt the view of all of the shareholders and the government is a minority shareholder it is now a matter for both boards to see how to proceed

326284 the sky done clouded over after glory fckn suns debut album yielding this brooding and corrosive follow up the new zealand sorta super group of antony milton ben spiers and simon ororke concoct a slow burning behemoth of metallic shivers and distortion churn dark enough to invoke the dread name haino spectra is an unsettling mind meld spiers desolate soundscapes bleed into miltons heavy drones which are complemented perfectly by ororkes restless percussion group improvisation is the natural language of these three even listing their solo and collaborative albums over the past decade would take way more effort than i can muster suffice to say this is a stellar and unique record to add to their massive discographies
326285 the fourth album by the sample sculptor of finlands oulu features only one long piece of sound slowly and ponderously developing sound mass moves between minimalist ambient and melodic sequences both beautiful and mentally jarring it is both organic and spacy almost at the same time

326296 portlands tone wrangler aaron davis aka acre has been blasting the world with his massive but barely there feedback swells for quite some time with releases on black horizons jk and more his first lp offering brings about the acre essence quite well massive walls of shoe gazed feedback are some how tamed into smooth quintessential drones this is not the sound of synthesizers or keyboards but a single tone being modified and replicated into a monolithic piece stasis so strong it is hard to realize the power of these two side long tracks until they end forcing silence back upon the listener direct hypnosis and transcendental zoning

326311 richard skelton presides over every aspect of the beautifully presented releases on his sustain release label a project initiated in memorandum to his wife louise the weight of which can be felt in all that skelton produces from the hand crafted and personalised edition of one cd s featuring louise s photographs of the surrounding lancashire landscape to the heartfelt and considered music contained within firstperson is very proud to be the first to release skelton s music outside of his own label a trend that will continue with future releases on students of decay amongst others for this release we are treated to a slowly unfolding meditation on the sonorities of the violin an elegiac and minimalistic rendition in the mould of arvo part or anton batagov this is music of substance that lingers long after it recedes into silence
326312 tapping into his french heritage through the work of the musique concrete pioneers maxime primault uses the world around him as his source material the results are first rate exercises in electro acoustic manipulation in which tones are shaped and matched to produce attenuated and considered drone studies primault also takes time out to run the crier dans les mus es label notable for the compilation cris et chuchotements featuring likeminded artists such as peter wright valerio cosi kuupuu and ghost brames of the cerfs
326313 fraser burnett has quietly built up an assured reputation for consistent and solid releases for labels such as lee stokoe s matching head blackest rainbow recently sharing a split lp with culver and his own pjorn imprint in an overcrowded genre sitting through another slab of drone music can sometimes feel like a laborious and thankless task however what works for me in this instance is the utter sincerity with which each release arrives i get the impression that none of this music is forced no hip references or longing to be part of it whatever the fuck it is seven tracks of subtle brain melt that could easily stretch to an hour each a canny tactic that has you reaching for the play button as soon as it s over

326320 an average of 522 applications have been lodged weekly since the budget with 794 in one week alone

326326 i call on the state government to uphold the inherent social justice philosophy of the labor party and purchase homes from those people in our community who are suffering with this burden financially and mentally

326440 like genesis for example there is one person in genesis who lives like 920 years this makes no sense
326441 well the length of a day was measured from sun up to sun down
326442 ok 920 divided by two is what 460 thats still too long
326443 ok geologically speaking the shortest day which is when the earth first began was 8 hours long so 460 divided by 3 is still like 120 which is still way too long for someone to have lived in a time with no vaccines preventative health care nutrition
326444 well the air was purer back then so people could live longer
326445 were you on this date we have nothing in common i dont believe in anything you believe in

326452 it was probably one of the most exciting skateboarding events ever
326453 we tried but espn wouldnt listen to anything we said so they went ahead to have a bmx ramp builder design and build the thing
326454 it just doesnt work for skateboarding and i hear the bmxers arent too happy about it either
326455 i think what we wanted to build was too much money and they saw how bad the contest went last year because of the format and they felt like they didnt want to blow their wad on something like that
326456 its built like expletive basically the guy that built it needs to be fired
326457 we have some say but this year they kinda stuck it to us

326477 james mirtle is good enough to challenge eric at off wing as the best hockey blogger out there
326478 his performance during this years trade deadline became its own tribe in brazil
326479 one of my favorite spots on the internet is mirtles site i wont lie guy knows his stuff and is an excellent writer
326480 mirtle looks like the kind of guy who would like to take you out to a nice dinner and talk hockey to you all night long
326481 james mirtle is battling off wing for the title of
326482 james mirtle bats out one heck of a hockey blog
326483 want to know what sports blogging can look like when its in the hands of a real journalist
326484 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
326485 tailored or facilitated the tailoring of internet advertising based on consumers internet search surfing or other use
326486 we are interested in the nature and extent to which you engage in such practices and the impact it could have on consumer privacy
326487 we look forward to responding promptly to the committees request
326488 will i be expected or do i need to pose nude to be a model
326489 wow lourdes i had no idea that you listen to this stuff
326490 i can ride to work each day pay 50 its an incredible savings
326491 transit by its nature is never a break even or money making venture
326492 if youre not even breaking even if youre losing money theres no reason to keep it going
326493 the skyway is a very important part of the overall mobility program that we have for jacksonville no we are not contemplating at all closing down the skyway
326494 howie just actually reminded us that we were here years and years ago
326495 i got my earring ripped out by kevin by accident while he and i were wrestling
326496 my record is a lot more personal and a lot more real so to speak
326497 my stuff is a little more relatable as far as things ive been through heartache the rela tionship i dont have with my dad
326498 as i started making the record i found i had a lot more to say than i thought i did and i had more to get off my chest
326499 the only thing i didnt harp on was my sobriety and the drugs i didnt want to go there yet
326500 it was a little difficult at first but we were cool with it kevin moved on and so have we were comfortable with what we do as four and its still just as strong
326501 competitive spirit thats just in every single one of us and to be the best that we can be as a team as a group and musically we feel that what we stand for is honesty and purity in great music that people love
326502 i think the most challenging part was kind of figuring out who the new backstreet boys are because that was an issue when kevin had left the group
326503 i think we kind of doubted ourselves at certain times but once we realized we were confident i think that it turned out to be really good and were excited
326504 only time will tell weve been around for 15 years and we really havent left the scene
326505 we are rooting for the new kids on the block to succeed
326506 cosa sarebbe ora questa mia vita se avessi scelto cos e nn cos

326508 although this democrat sic majority just adjourned for the democrat sic 5 week vacation house republicans are continuing to fight on the house floor although the lights mics and c span cameras have been turned off house republicans are on the floor speaking to the tax payers sic in the gallery who not surprisingly agree with republican energy proposals
326509 i love this congress can be so boring this is a kick
326510 turn out the lights the partys over or perhaps not
326511 the so called left right political spectrum is our own creation in fact it accurately reflects our careful artificial polarization of the population on phony issues that prevents the issue of our power from arising in their minds
326512 so europe thinks it is no longer a participant but really an observer of war
326513 observer of history and europe believes more than that that in the reality you have not you have nothing left which could be called history with real enmities ph real vision of the world opposite and so on and so on we have a sort of eirenic vision of the world in europe we have the feeling that the things will get into order anyway and that any form of too strong opposition is wrong so that is true when barack obama if elected shows his muscles in front of iran for example or in front of pakistan as he said as he already announced you will hear some voices in europe to say please peace before all and this is our illness in europe
326514 let me just add something to what bernard said and which i think is important when you are the weaker party and you deal with somebody who is very very strong and very big its mr big rather than mr bush you either want control over that power or you want that power to be like you and so if i read some of the most interesting fantasies in the respective ph world press around here you get this image of obama which he isnt he s kind of social democratic he s kind of peace minded he s u n minded and he will be and that s the most interesting thought he will preside over weakened and chastened america after iraq and therefore we ll be able to like america better and him better than bush because america will be more like us but of course america will never be like europe it will the daughter of europe as de gaulle once said but that daughter left home in the 18th century and never came back

326516 the bicycle is carrying the sack of potatoes i am glad that i do not have to carry them on my back
326517 you are a smart boy when you grow old you will not walk hunched over like i do
326518 i love to watch the trees and fields pass by as i roll down the path
326519 when i ride my bicycle i am content to chant nam myoho renge kyo
326520 your mind will roll with the ease of a newly trued wheel

326526 the invasion of iraq was about oil but it didnt result in more oil or cheaper gas
326527 it resulted in war profiteering by oil companies who benefited by keeping iraqi oil off the market
326528 iraq needs oil revenue now more than ever as they try to rebuild their country
326529 this administration wants to siphon money away from iraq reconstruction and toward further inflation of big oil profits while demanding that iraq bears more of the reconstruction costs now an architect of the illegal unjustified war may be trying to profit from it personally
326530 actions such as this undermine u s foreign policy by depriving iraqis of their constitutionally guaranteed rights to their own resources

326532 i wouldnt have any idea this early in the preseason whether thatd be an accurate ranking
326533 i know its something thats not very significant until the end of the year and thats what we talked about with the team
326534 once we hold up that acc trophy everythings going to be fine
326535 my first fall practice my first camp it was a little different than the spring
326536 i think i have to get better and make more adjustments
326537 lets go lets go the ball cant be on the ground
326538 if our guys see it and are hungry and keep the hunger and it creates a sense of urgency then thats good
326539 if they dont work as hard and say weve arrived weve got this ranking and go about business as usual thats not good
326540 how do i catalog a book about angels is it fiction or nonfiction

326542 he was supposed to return sunday night around 7 p m and never showed back up
326543 i kind of imagined it because every mother imagines the worst case scenario but i truly didnt expect him to actually go through with it
326544 when theyre in the heat of the moment im sure a lot of parents think about this sort of thing as an easy quick solution but really its not
326545 maybe a highly emotional person may get angry a lot may say a lot of things they dont mean and sometimes its hard to know whether to take someone seriously when its something like this
326546 if you think the parent of your child may be the type to do something like this its staying awake to what theyre doing
326547 i ran some of the biggest nightclubs in boston for 5 years until the industry changed
326548 then i fell into dancing just to try it and fell in love with it that is where i can gained my confidence in my sexuality and my body i was really quite shy about it before then my mother always taught me brains before beauty
326549 i got into this business because i love sex and i really wanted to try something i had never done before it wasnt something i fell into i have a business degree and chose adult with the full blessing of my husband
326550 i dont do anything on film i would not do in my own bedroom
326551 it was amazing to be part of something that big
326552 i got to work with abby brooks and im very proud to be associated with a movie like pirates 2
326553 i have a strong business background so this was a challenge i was well prepared for it was a lot of fun i learned a great deal and i am very proud of the results
326554 it is an exciting new venture i am undertaking with jack we got into the adult industry together ran nightclubs together and have always done things as a team i cant give away the details but we will be serving them up very soon
326555 cant exercise and this would give them some of the benefits
326556 people who exercise have lower levels of depression and higher bone density
326557 whether or not this pill would confer those benefits we dont know
326558 we realized that we just couldnt continue living this way i designed our new house and the results were profound life became so much easier and the boys could be more independent as they grew but you cant tell by looking that this is home to people with severe mobility vision and balance impairment
326559 if more money went into making such homes elders could remain independent for longer
326560 we would save money in the long run there would be less need for chore services and home care
326561 he had trousers on was still wearing his shoes and had a big box around his waist
326562 theyre doing what they need to do for a formal id
326563 he was just such a logical person we tried to think like he would and figure out where he might go
326564 we would drive past the places wed identified and look for his car
326565 we reported this oversight to the regulators and we have fully cooperated with them in all aspects of this investigation
326566 t here is simply no basis for claims to the contrary
326567 in addition to our initiatives we are actively working with regulatory authorities including the to secure the best and fastest route to providing liquidity
326568 it seems like hes this weird kind of pack rat
326569 a lot of people are coming in and telling stories
326570 he was just a sore in the neighbourhood compared to the rest of the area hes the dark spot
326571 sort of like being at the dog pound and all the dogs are waiting for an owner saying take me take me
326572 i went oooh that looks like my bike i found my baby
326573 everyone there leaves their bikes unlocked i think we should be able to be like that
326574 it was one of those happy sad moments it was all rusted out and not treated properly it wasnt worth taking home but it was a sense of closure
326575 a lot of people instead of calling and saying thats my bicycle would just pay igor 30 and take their bike back
326576 we were in plainclothes that afternoon just on our way to another bike bait location
326577 these guys had to empty the garages and in this heat and they took them all over to the police garage on hanna and they ran out of room so they had to put them all in the truck and bring them over here when i got back on shift they said you better watch your car rowe im gonna owe those guys some cold drinks at some point
326578 we cant hang horse thieves anymore so we want to see how the process works
326579 now that igors in jail you see all the crackheads circling around igors shop and scurrying away everyone used to see his truck driving around full of bikes
326580 we knocked three homicides off the front page because everyone can relate to having their bike stolen
326581 ive never been in a mosh pit before i think i would get f ed up in a mosh pit
326582 i dont really think about no 1 and at the moment i dont deserve it
326583 all of a sudden i just got exhausted completely lost my concentration
326584 it was hard for me to keep up because the points were quite long the longer the play went i felt worse and worse
326585 ive started to believe i can beat these top players
326586 they trying to make me out as one its wild as expletive

326630 put more simply usage of 64 bit windows vista is growing much more rapidly than 32 bit
326631 based on current trends this growth will accelerate as the retail channel shifts to supplying a rapidly increasing assortment of 64 bit desktops and laptops
326632 if you start from almost zero its easy to triple
326633 two things have to happen people have to begin deploying vista in a broad way and have to believe that all of their applications are fully compatible with a 64 bit environment
326634 its nice to see 64 bit use tracking this way
326635 but im not going home to the wife and saying its finally the time i have to go out and buy a 64 bit windows pc i just dont think people are excited by this kind of thing the way they used to be

326643 alfresco does charge for support and it has very large deals theres a potential for savings but it would depend on the specifics
326644 one of the things you always hear about sharepoint is that microsoft gives it away thats not true and neither is the idea that open source is free
326645 quickly shifted their marketing from being an open source alternative to documentum to being an open source alternative to sharepoint
326646 sharepoint is really the disrupter in the content management market now presenting itself as an alternative to that is a good story to tell
326647 theyre smart to not position it as a rip and replace because so many people are early on in their sharepoint implementations

326692 hard to brand the bucs a winner or a loser i liked the bay trade but was less enthused with nady marte
326693 you have to give him credit for standing alone and calling the yankees losers
326694 i thought it was going to be a tear or something like that
326695 i still think i can help this team in a big way
326696 from the way we understand it the more rest the better hell be
326697 its a little later than i wanted to be back but you gotta take their schedule and do what they want
326698 i think its a culmination of obviously frustrating moments individually and team wise
326699 please im just doing my job please do not make this hard for both of us please
326700 we ned to democratilize dis country to maek it more like us
326701 you do realize that belarus is a military dictatorship the only one left in europe right pictures of poverty and extreme militarism beautiful
326702 oh what pretty pictures of a country ive never seen or thought about before that makes me want to learn more about it
326703 click here to discover our most successful program for telephone fear
326704 im scared of the phone unless its 8 30 to 9 00
326705 well uh i have this fear of phones you see
326706 well you managed to call didnt you youre faking it arent you
326707 many from eastern europe said i will never go back because they knew what stalinism meant for them catholic priests for example knew they could not go back to work in the baltic states
326708 the documents are of great interest for both the families of these people and for researchers as they reveal the post war migration movements and immigration policies of the time
326709 they havent seen me and i havent seen them so they really had no idea how i was going to attack them
326710 i know we threw a lot of off speed stuff theyre a really good fastball hitting team and sometimes thats what you got to do to win
326711 you can tell theyre excited to be here and also they have an idea of what theyre doing
326712 its hard because those are three really important players on this team
326713 you can say that but i think you have to give their pitcher credit for once
326714 i mean he pitched a great game we havent seen him and we didnt have a lot of footage and from what we saw he was definitely better than what we saw on video i cant say 100 percent that we didnt have a letdown but you definitely have to give that kid credit it would be a shame not to give him the credit that he deserves
326715 their professionalism was something i learned from over the past couple years its something a lot of people will have to carry on
326716 were not going to rush i know now hes very excited his brothers here
326717 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
326718 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
326719 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
326720 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
326721 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
326722 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
326723 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
326724 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
326725 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
326726 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
326727 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
326728 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
326729 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
326730 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
326731 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
326732 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
326733 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
326734 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
326735 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
326736 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
326737 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
326738 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
326739 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
326740 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
326741 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
326742 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

326745 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
326746 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
326747 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
326748 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
326749 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
326750 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
326751 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
326752 he always had a huge smile and made his customers feel so welcome
326753 he had very high standards for himself and the food he served
326754 a shameful era is over in australian politics the minister for immigration chris evans has announced fundamental changes to a detention regime that was the cruellest in the western world it is cause for celebration but it would be a terrible waste if australians failed to learn the lessons of that time it should never be forgotten that australian politicians with mass support locked thousands of children and adults behind razor wire in desert camps demonised them stripped them of their names turned the water cannon on them and drove many of them insane this treatment broke their spirits and damaged their minds in ways saddam hussein and the taliban never did the vast majority were eventually found to be genuine refugees it would do a disservice to the refugees if their ordeal taught us nothing what is the lesson it is as i see it for a country never to allow the ends to justify its means especially when the means involve cruelty to children second to respect the rule of law and the human rights that underpin a civilised society innocent people are destroyed when a government jettisons basic legal principles and betrays time honoured values

326758 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
326759 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
326760 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
326761 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
326762 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
326763 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
326764 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
326765 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
326766 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
326767 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
326768 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
326769 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
326770 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
326771 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
326772 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
326773 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
326774 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
326775 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
326776 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
326777 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
326778 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
326779 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
326780 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
326781 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
326782 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
326783 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
326784 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
326785 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
326786 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
326787 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
326788 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
326789 i got a call from del bangit who is the close in security of maam president gloria macapagal arroyo he told me to come up with a case against lacson
326790 expressed disappointment over the results of the trip and that pma class of 1979 had let her down
326791 that was the first time i saw the pictures honestly i dont know and have no basis for claiming that the houses in the pictures were ping lacsons
326792 because it was a one time paying job i was ordered to do it i was paid to do it

326794 en este circuito puedes optar por una estrategia convencional a dos paradas y un primer stint largo para hacer una buena carrera y coger los m ximos puntos posibles o arriesgar haciendo una buena crono y luego con los dedos cruzados en toda la carrera para que no te adelanten muchos coches nosotros todav a no hemos decidido qu vamos a hacer depende de lo r pido que vayamos durante la calificaci n
326795 si el coche va bien y somos r pidos optaremos por arriesgar pero si vemos que el coche va regular tendremos que optar por ir a lo seguro
326796 los tiempos no son significativos porque puede depender de la gasolina que llevaban los dem s lo que no es normal es que estemos tan arriba y por encima de ferrari tendremos que luchar si queremos estar en estas posiciones
326797 hay veces que todo te sale bien y otros que tienes un d a negro otras veces depende de los reglajes o del tr fico y hoy por ayer todo ha salido bien que es buena se al

326800 los mclaren fueron m s r pidos pero si ferrari estaba rodando con mucha gasolina cuando la quiten van a volar no descartar a a ferrari gane quien gane la carrera no ser significativo porque queda mucho campeonato hace tres carreras ferrari hac a primero y segundo en todas las pruebas y ahora se ha girado pero no es nada definitivo hasta el final nadie va a dar un golpe significativo

326824 i cant see why this guy would even attack him
326825 he would never pick a fight he wouldnt intimidate the guy
326826 he was a great person he was kind thoughtful and he did not deserve this i feel for his parents and sisters and his lil bro
326827 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
326828 he had a rambo hunting knife covered in blood and he just kept going at the guy
326829 he was very calmly killing the guy and the other guy was screaming bloody murder
326830 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy

326832 a special impulse led st francis on a certain night to go to the chapel there he saw our lord and his holy mother surrounded by a great host of angels filled with astonishment and reverence the saint prostrated himself upon the ground and adored the divine majesty then he heard the voice of our lord urging him with ineffable tenderness to ask some special favor nothing was so near to the heart of francis as the salvation of souls and so after a few moments of reflection he asked for the grace of a full pardon for all who being contrite and having confessed their sins would visit this little sanctuary mary cast herself upon her knees before her divine son and repeated the petition of her faithful servant

326834 he invented an elaborate story designed to show how fond he was of telling the truth it was a boys way of manipulating the world
326835 small independent publisher based in london with a background in publishing history related titles
326836 as darwin was now claiming that he had sketched out his evolutionary theory not in 1842 but in 1839 moreover they claimed that the contents of the 1844 essay darwins preliminary draft of his theory had not only been read by hooker but had been communicated to lyell himself there was no mention of the fact that both men had voiced serious objections over several years to darwins migration theory which alongside the idea of perfect adaptation had been central to his thinking in 1844 and for a long time after
326837 had alfred russel wallace sent his letter of march 1858 not to charles darwin but to the editor of the annals and magazine of natural history
326838 it is likely that we would today talk abot wallaceism rather than darwinism
326839 on the tendency of varieties to depart indefinitely from the original type
326840 after a hundred years we are almost as uncertain of the authorship or editorship of darwins writings as we are of those attributed to homer or hippocrates
326841 he darwin completely rewrote his galapagos entries to take in the new ideas and information he had gleaned from the islands vice governor nicholas lawson and other specialists between 1837 and 1845 long after his return giving a distorted picture of how the galapagos had struck him on the voyage ten years before
326842 why the recent article in nature calling for wallace recognition is right and wrong
326843 was not intellectually constrained by the idea of a world designed by god
326844 his malay travels reinforced wallaces disavowal of adherence to any traditional orthodox religion but
326845 wallaces emerging evolutionary worldview was compatible with a broader spiritual and teleological framework that would become more overt on his return to england
326846 that wallaces observations of these apes were leading him to invoke more explicitly the concept of design in nature
326847 if as i have attempted to do here we take a broad and comprehensive view of the vast world of life as it is spread out before us and also of that earlier world which goes back and ever farther back into the dim past among the relics of preceding forms of life we meet with ever greater and greater difficulties in dispensing with a guiding purpose and an immanent creative power
326848 wherever darwin was at the dinner table and watching people laugh and have a good time or visiting the doctor with his children he was observing carefully reflecting questioning and tentatively fitting his ideas into a grand theoretical system
326849 why should you be so aggressive is anything to be gained by forcing new ideas on people

326884 bob and me have a pretty good track record of making big fights i will sit down with bob on wednesday and i think we will know in a half hour if we have a deal or not
326885 the truth is a lot of people are saying that oscar the golden boy of boxing really has all the advantages in a fight he is bigger taller heftier and has a longer reach

326892 and the people who werent are people who dont put journalism first or who have a very shallow understanding of san francisco politics or of who willie brown is or of the reporting done in hearst papers on willie brown

326901 i wish i could have taken some of those things back but i said them i respect him as a race car driver hes very fast hes not on my christmas card list any more and he probably never will be
326902 if were around each other on the track im going to race him probably harder than ive raced anybody but im not here to be a dirty driver and do what he did to me its not my way im still mad about it but im not going to go out there and wreck him or anything im a lover not a fighter
326903 were both driving fords so we see each other from time to time hes not overly friendly to me so its his choice to make the next move i tried to clear the air after mexico
326904 i dont owe him anything i dont owe him more of an apology than ive already done if he wants to talk or not thats his choice ive got no bad feelings im looking forward to racing him hard
326905 the first thing that catches your eye is just how many people are here
326906 ive never been to a track on a friday where the grandstands are packed i dont know if canadians dont work on fridays or what but its really cool its a cool atmosphere and theres no other race that we go to thats like that
326907 the nice thing here is that there are some very long straights where you can drop down and pass
326908 coming through the first 15 20 guys will be easy then it will get harder the closer you come to the front
326909 this is the most difficult track that i race without a doubt its technical its very high speed the turns are very slow you get in there at 170 mph and then youre right back down to 40 mph on the turns
326910 jimmy johnson jeff gordon juan pablo montoya we didnt get along in f1 but in nascar hes a very nice guy thats the nice thing about nascar everyone seems to help out
326911 put it this way i wouldnt want to be marcos
326912 you say things in the heat of the battle right after because its an emotional sport
326913 i wish i could have taken some of those things back but i said them i respect him as a race car driver hes very fast hes not on my christmas card list any more and he probably never will be
326914 if were around each other on the track im going to race him probably harder than ive raced anybody but im not here to be a dirty driver and do what he did to me its not my way im still mad about it but im not going to go out there and wreck him or anything im a lover not a fighter
326915 were both driving fords so we see each other from time to time hes not overly friendly to me so its his choice to make the next move i tried to clear the air after mexico
326916 i dont owe him anything i dont owe him more of an apology than ive already done if he wants to talk or not thats his choice ive got no bad feelings im looking forward to racing him hard
326917 the first thing that catches your eye is just how many people are here
326918 ive never been to a track on a friday where the grandstands are packed i dont know if canadians dont work on fridays or what but its really cool its a cool atmosphere and theres no other race that we go to thats like that
326919 the nice thing here is that there are some very long straights where you can drop down and pass
326920 coming through the first 15 20 guys will be easy then it will get harder the closer you come to the front
326921 this is the most difficult track that i race without a doubt its technical its very high speed the turns are very slow you get in there at 170 mph and then youre right back down to 40 mph on the turns
326922 jimmy johnson jeff gordon juan pablo montoya we didnt get along in f1 but in nascar hes a very nice guy thats the nice thing about nascar everyone seems to help out
326923 its not a question of how to drive the track
326924 theres some rules in nascar racing on a road course that are different than in open wheel theres some things i needed to know
326925 while some might have chosen to exhaust their legal options to try to force their way into the games jessica instead chose to put her teams interests ahead of her own
326926 ive never wanted to do anything remotely close to doping its never ever crossed my mind ive never been approached about doing it its never been an issue my entire career its the last thing i would ever do
326927 while some might have chosen to exhaust their legal options to try to force their way into the games jessica instead chose to put her teams interests ahead of her own
326928 ive never wanted to do anything remotely close to doping its never ever crossed my mind ive never been approached about doing it its never been an issue my entire career its the last thing i would ever do
326929 we believe the challenger of record has to be a real yacht club it cannot be something that is manufactured with a defender to set up a one sided event this decision would set an absurd precedent
326930 we believe we have an excellent case for winning on appeal
326931 you can turn to the american southwest where theres no water left in the colorado river and the highest bidders are the big cities so the irrigators are free to sell the water to them
326932 it doesnt take a rocket scientist to see theres some huge problems shaping up why are we letting this province go down that same path
326933 when you start giving value to something thats priceless that becomes a problem
326934 we all have to pay the cost of creating potable water but when you start creating these huge costs for water thats a problem
326935 its a way or process of doing business that lets the market decide where the water is going based upon need
326936 there are those out there in the private sector that have deeper pockets than we do
326937 they are actively out in the marketplace pursuing it because they see it as a means to an end in terms of further investment on the development landscape
326938 its not a question of is there sufficient water its a question of how that water is allocated
326939 watching how people have reacted and what happened over the last year within that closed basin has caused us to look at our policies and revisit them
326940 even if they have a licence to withdraw water from the athabasca river we can step in and say no because its for the good of all albertans
326941 the government is effectively handing over the power to manage and assure that water resources are there for conservation for the rivers and for the people thats a delegation of power that were not prepared to approve
326942 police you shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life its inappropriate

326945 ive donated hundreds if not thousands of hours to the fraternity
326946 i was trying to protect the whole game the integrity of the game
326947 the wnba is very special to me because i have four daughters i dont even raise my hand to them and i would never push a woman this game i love this game too much
326948 as a role model its just really difficult this is not the way we wanna represent ourselves you know im a mom i dont wanna represent myself like this in front of my daughter and then to have a coach push me down i dont even know why he was pushing me i wasnt swinging or hitting anybody i was just gonna go help my teammate up
326949 i dont need to ride the storm of comments that get made and get taken out of context
326950 im just pleased i went out today and put a good show on it wasnt quite good enough because padraig put in a hell of a performance and really did his stuff on the back nine
326951 there was no offer made i have read the same articles they have made it clear that he is not for sale and we will make it clear we have not made an offer
326952 there is no reason to negotiate over something they dont want to do and we have not made an offer
326953 there has been no offer of 150 million euros for kaka from anyone even less so chelsea
326954 these are urban legends that nourish themselves tomorrow someone will write 200 million and hopefully by september well reach 300 million i met with chelsea owner roman abramovich we asked about sheva andrei shevchenko and he asked about kaka but we talked about numbers and it ended 0 0 real madrid have also called about kaka but he is staying with us
326955 didier is injured the doctor and our medical staff made a plan to have him training and playing in maybe three or four weeks

326964 its has already been shown that the animals at the baghdad zoo cannot be properly protected from the countrys military conflict when the war began hundreds of animals in the zoo were killed stolen eaten or let loose by looters the last two tigers escaped and were shot dead the future is uncertain most of the people in iraq still do not have access to basic necessities or a safe environment and iraq remains a war zone sending tigers there would place the animals squarely in harms way
326965 wow that was an interesting growl i wonder if i can see what kind of animal made that

326979 hes been working at it and hes getting better but hes still a long way from being that shortstop that can go to his left and to his right
326980 basically we talked to him about this yesterday and he was resistant to it based on the fact that he was getting better and he felt that he could help the ballclub
326981 even though he may be able to play in 12 days instead of 15 i think we can take this luxury now that we have manny and weve got a little more bench strength hes just taking one for the team basically
326982 there are 25 guys down there right now that feel like a team
326983 it hasnt felt like that for a while and you have to feel like that in professional sports to perform at your best
326984 it didnt seem like we were handling the challenge up to what we needed to

326988 i dont think its fair of me to sit here today and look back and comment on why manny was unhappy its a question for manny
326989 he had a remarkable run here hes one of the best right handed hitters in history
326990 if i was a free agent i couldnt have picked a better place to go
326991 we were having a difficult time and it wasnt any one persons fault
326992 there was doubt there was even exhaustion on the part of some players and a pretty major distraction
326993 manny and i were friends of course im going to miss him
326994 for jason we want what we want for the rest of the players to have an atmosphere where good players want to do the right thing
326995 were not asking him to fill ramirezs shoes were asking him to be a contributing member of a winning baseball team emphasis on the last word
326996 the rule is from the commissioners office when someone gets ejected from a game for throwing at somebody it comes with a suspension

327128 once we hold up that acc trophy everythings going to be fine
327129 my first fall practice my first camp it was a little different than the spring
327130 i think i have to get better and make more adjustments
327131 lets go lets go the ball cant be on the ground
327132 if our guys see it and are hungry and keep the hunger and it creates a sense of urgency then thats good
327133 if they dont work as hard and say weve arrived weve got this ranking and go about business as usual thats not good
327134 while some might have chosen to exhaust their legal options to try to force their way into the games jessica instead chose to put her teams interests ahead of her own
327135 ive never wanted to do anything remotely close to doping its never ever crossed my mind ive never been approached about doing it its never been an issue my entire career its the last thing i would ever do
327136 we see the hospital going in a space maybe where theres a large neighbourhood nearby but also where theres a lot of land available so we could see further infrastructure development from a city point of view from sale of lots and building of houses and see the city spread out a little bit
327137 we want to make sure that not only the city surrounding municipalities and the hospital has input in this id like to see all citizens who have views on this put forward their recommendations
327138 i would encourage them to contact the consultant directly or if its easier for them contact my office and well pass them along
327139 one thing about hospitals is they grow and parking is very important
327140 in my opinion they should pick a site with lots of room for future expansion

327144 everyone is entitled to their view hes given his analysis i consider his analysis a literal interpretation a strict constructionist interpretation a proper interpretation of the legislation would have to consider the wording in context when you consider the wording in context the minister of education plays a very important role
327145 i can tell you the minister is well aware of the legislation is well aware of her responsibilities and is carrying them out
327146 the remarks the minister made tuesday i think its fair to say they did call the universitys autonomy into question
327147 its fair to say the legislation says the board the appoints the president
327148 we seem to have a misunderstanding over what that clause in the memorial university act says and its important to have the opportunity to sit down with the minister and discuss that misunderstanding
327149 the actions of the minister have thrown the presidential appointment process into disarray
327150 her unilateral actions of conducting interviews with potential candidates undermines the integrity of the duly constituted search committee and the board of regents
327151 the minister obviously does not understand her role or the legislation that governs this appointment government cannot recruit interview recommend or appoint a president of their own choice
327152 its a job you can do if youre young or if you are 30 or 40 we have some service engineers who are 30 or 40 and have families at home but that is not so much my style i want to do it while im young i can see the world and see the different cultures and lifestyles of the people it is very interesting
327153 its one of the best countries i have ever stayed the food is good the people are good and you can do something outside of the working

327164 relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo led to his death

327169 we believe that we should try to let the first stimulus package have a chance to work first before we move forward on trying to get a second one

327171 important to help improve and increase stability and confidence in the housing market

327174 my attitude is that we can find some sort of compromise
327175 if it is part of an overarching package then i am not going to be rigid in preventing an energy package that goes forward that is really thoughtful and is going to really solve the problem

327376 posteriormente apareceu a tiago e depois a todos os ap stolos em ltimo lugar apareceu tamb m a mim como a um abortivo pois sou o menor dos ap stolos nem sou digno de ser chamado ap stolo porque persegui a igreja de deus

327397 a merger would be good news for our customers and enhance our existing relationship
327398 the aviation landscape is changing and airline consolidation is long overdue
327399 the combined balance sheet anticipated synergies and network fit between the airlines make a merger an attractive proposition particularly in the current economic environment

327406 our findings raise the possibility that the physical symptoms of depression are particularly toxic to the cardiovascular system
327407 identifying the most harmful aspect of depression is important because we will then know which specific components to target with our treatments
327408 our study is important because it is the first to simultaneously examine the links between all of these negative emotions and sub clinical atherosclerosis
327409 in addition we broke depression down into physical and cognitive emotion symptom clusters which is uncommon
327410 no secondary prevention trial has successfully reduced cardiovascular risk by targeting depression
327411 there currently exists no evidence that treating depression will help prevent heart disease
327412 the biggest reason is that studies that would be needed to draw that conclusion would have to be large and therefore very expensive
327413 hopefully an added bonus will be to reduce the risk of developing or suffering from heart disease
327414 ultimately we plan to use the data from this study and similar investigations to develop a psychological treatment for adults at risk for cardiovascular disease
327415 we hope that our treatment when combined with standard treatments will help to prevent the development of cardiovascular disease

327462 mi nica prioridad es que el equipo llegue en las mejores condiciones posibles a esta cita fundamental

327468 there are black clouds of gods wrath now hanging directly over your heads full of the dreadful storm and big with thunder
327469 god should only withdraw his hand from the floodgate it would immediately fly open and the fiery floods of the fierceness and wrath of god would rush forth with inconceivable fury and would come upon you with great power

327513 no conocemos el estado actual de ambos equipos pero para el segundo partido en cracovia se desplazar alguien del staff de la secretar a t cnica para seguir el partido en directo y tendremos unas impresiones m s directas
327514 no debemos hablar mucho de la grandeza de los clubs que nos han tocado sino concentrarnos en nosotros mismos debemos mantener la actitud de la pretemporada para garantizar el xito
327515 ha sido un sorteo positivo m s a n si lo comparamos con el atl tico por ejemplo que le ha tocado el schalke 04
327516 mal ir amos que por no tener un jugador sufri ramos por la eliminatoria el bar a es un equipo mejor si pudi ramos contar con leo porque es un gran jugador y es nuestro pero si no no pasa nada

327520 es un rival de nuestro nivel la eliminatoria est al cincuenta por ciento soy muy optimista hay que jugar los dos partidos y la ventaja de campo es importante
327521 tambi n debe estar preocupado sabiendo que la vuelta es en madrid y que somos un equipo que estamos creciendo que estamos trabajando que hemos fichado bien y que llevamos un par de a os intentando volver a los primeros planos es un rival para volver a los primeros planos
327522 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
327523 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
327524 based on this post i guess its safe to say youre pretty much a pro choice republican
327525 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
327526 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
327527 yeah youll get your drilling on our terms but only if you agree to xyz on long term energy policy
327528 estados unidos y espa a son los m ximos favoritos para pek n
327529 si vienen un delantero y un centrocampista ofensivo nos pueden ayudar el real madrid tiene que pelear siempre por todo los t tulos y para ganar la liga a lo mejor va bien con esta plantilla pero si se quiere pelear por los tres t tulos vendr a bien una ayuda en la zona ofensiva para rotar y dar descanso es importante tener una plantilla compensada para que no se noten los cambios en las rotaciones
327530 salen muchos rumores y eso no es bueno para la plantilla he hablado con varios jugadores para tranquilizarles porque lo prioritario en pretemporada es trabajar
327531 el tema de ortega se est poniendo complicado me produce una tristeza enorme estamos tras l todo el tiempo pero no s c mo terminar esto no podemos tomar una decisi n en caliente
327532 todos los equipos quieren tener al mejor piloto en sus filas y fernando es bicampe n y el mejor so amos con contar con l
327533 tenemos al mejor jefe que existe en estos momentos ross brawn contamos con los mejores ingenieros un gran potencial electr nico presupuesto un grupo de profesionales dispuestos a dar el cien por cien por el equipo y un ambiente espectacular
327534 entre renault y honda honestamente la mejor opci n para fernando es la nuestra aunque si la pregunta es entre honda y ferrari entiendo que las cosas est n m s igualadas y la decisi n es dif cil
327535 lo que dije fue que existe una esclavitud moderna con chicos j venes de 13 14 o 15 a os cuando se los llevan a grandes clubs
327536 la soluci n a todo este asunto la tienen ambos clubs y el futbolista la fifa no tiene nada que decir al respecto y no va a intervenir
327537 en este circuito puedes optar por una estrategia convencional a dos paradas y un primer stint largo para hacer una buena carrera y coger los m ximos puntos posibles o arriesgar haciendo una buena crono y luego con los dedos cruzados en toda la carrera para que no te adelanten muchos coches nosotros todav a no hemos decidido qu vamos a hacer depende de lo r pido que vayamos durante la calificaci n
327538 si el coche va bien y somos r pidos optaremos por arriesgar pero si vemos que el coche va regular tendremos que optar por ir a lo seguro
327539 los tiempos no son significativos porque puede depender de la gasolina que llevaban los dem s lo que no es normal es que estemos tan arriba y por encima de ferrari tendremos que luchar si queremos estar en estas posiciones
327540 hay veces que todo te sale bien y otros que tienes un d a negro otras veces depende de los reglajes o del tr fico y hoy por ayer todo ha salido bien que es buena se al
327541 tenemos m s motivos que otros d as para ser optimistas pero tenemos que evaluar todos los datos del coche para conseguir ser lo m s competitivos posible
327542 quer amos utilizar estos entrenamientos para comprobar cu nto podemos perder en una tanda larga y el coche cargado y la verdad es que fue bien y fuimos constantes
327543 los mclaren fueron m s r pidos pero si ferrari estaba rodando con mucha gasolina cuando la quiten van a volar no descartar a a ferrari gane quien gane la carrera no ser significativo porque queda mucho campeonato hace tres carreras ferrari hac a primero y segundo en todas las pruebas y ahora se ha girado pero no es nada definitivo hasta el final nadie va a dar un golpe significativo
327544 es un jugador del que ya ten amos referencias porque hab a jugado en el ciudad de murcia y hab a incluso coincidido con el ahora t cnico del badalona miguel alvarez a trav s del acuerdo que firmaron reus y barcelona se nos plante la posibilidad de que probara con nosotros y aceptamos encantados
327545 por m ojal se quede en el reus ya se lo he dicho a la directiva y a l personalmente estar a encantado de poder contar con david para esta pr xima temporada pero eso ya no depende de m habr que esperar a que su hermano samuel regrese de la gira por estados unidos y se re na con nuestro presidente para llegar a un acuerdo sobre el contrato de david
327546 es un jugador muy r pido y muy bien dotado t cnicamente juega muy f cil sabe interpretar perfectamente el uno contra uno y a nivel t ctico es muy inteligente tiene una punta de velocidad parecida a samuel pero le falta su agresividad yo ya le he dicho que si se queda con nosotros trabajaremos a fondo este aspecto los dos hermanos tienen una manera de jugar parecida aunque samuel f sicamente es m s fuerte
327547 me har a mucha ilusi n jugar aunque s lo sean dos minutos
327548 s lo ver un partido en old trafford por televisi n ya me impresionaba
327549 estoy deseando que llegue el momento de saltar al campo y echar una ojeada al estadio lleno
327550 ha dado grandes jugadores en los ltimos a os como scholes y giggs y anteriormente beckham o cantona
327551 nos enfrentamos a un equipo con mucha tradici n y esperamos vivir un ambiente muy bonito la verdad es que a todos nos hace mucha ilusi n
327552 jugamos en old trafford ante los campeones de europa y est claro que nadie se lo quiere perder
327553 s lo puedo adelantar sobre este tema que efectivamente el benfica ha hecho una oferta y que de esta propuesta no vamos a pasar
327554 no sabemos nada de la oferta que hemos hecho estamos esperando
327555 nortels revamped management team is doing a commendable job given the macro challenges and the limited internal resources
327556 this economic cycle is somewhat different in that lenders are actively restricting access to credit thereby muting the impact of the secular shift from paper
327557 mastercard and visa are among the rare financial related plays that we think have potential to post
327558 we would look for financial investors to increasingly view these names as a safe haven if we see another leg down in financials as the credit crisis continues to unwind

327570 its very intimidating you dont want to make anyone uncomfortable and you dont want to be uncomfortable
327571 you get on a bus and you dont want to spend three hours in traffic
327572 i think theyre afraid of interacting just afraid of not getting their thoughts out
327573 literally thats the fear of the marketplace but it can be described as the fear of leaving a safe place
327574 often leads to believing those activities would be harder than they are and a loss of confidence in our abilities to handle them
327575 challenging oneself to take on tasks that scare us a little can lead to a big improvement in energy and confidence almost like an antidepressant
327576 i only really go off base when the kids i work with go on trips
327577 a lot of people say theyre scared to drive off base because they dont want to get lost

327586 i wouldnt have any idea this early in the preseason whether thatd be an accurate ranking

327659 the rise of metro newspapers followed the rise of the downtown dept store the fall will follow the same trajectory
327660 the 20th century rise of the advertising dependent department store helped create the modern newspaper and their decline paralleled that of the newspaper franchise
327661 if the newspaper company is not to go the way of telegraph and microcomputer companies it may have to learn a lesson from department store retailers an industry of similar fragmentation and vintage to many american newspapers once the storied names of so many main streets department stores were devastated by the arrival of technologically savvy discounters such as wal mart stores news so many failed to adapt to the disruptive innovations of the big box superstores despite wave after wave of consolidation and cost cutting
327662 department stores once newspapers mainstay had undergone extensive restructuring as a result of acquisitions and mergers

327732 elected officials city managers county administrators economic and community development professionals tribal representatives and community leaders from del norte humboldt mendocino and trinity counties
327733 we are concerned that this report was issued without apparent understanding of how human incident reports are collected and managed and without a broader understanding of the safety profile of pyrethrins
327734 while the author of the report spoke at length late in july to me and to dr richard kingston one of the architects of the reporting systems used by the nations poison control centers and relied on by the environmental protection agency he failed to communicate the limitations in using raw incident report data in making conclusions about safety profiles
327735 instead the author used raw data incorrectly to derive the conclusions used in his story so the basis for his conclusions is flawed and represents a grossly inaccurate picture of the safety profile of pyrethrins
327736 the basic premise behind the story is that the epas raw database shows an increase in reports of adverse events but taking all incident data at face value in its raw form is a fundamentally flawed approach
327737 in an effort to conduct responsible product stewardship companies encourage consumers to call with any concerns and then must report all incident allegations to the epa but the incident details are often incomplete cannot be confirmed or not valid and the incidents may have no health implications whatsoever
327738 in the database these incidents are aggregated further with reports of individuals who for example used products to commit or attempt to commit suicide but both are treated as being equal theyre not
327739 the pjv will continue to reach out to consumers healthcare professionals news media representatives and others to share concerns about the nature of the story and its many other misrepresentations
327740 when the science is completely ignored and sensationalism becomes the focus additionally to suggest that the industry and the epa are not working to provide sufficient safeguards is simply absurd
327741 when they come in we will reserve the phone you ordered and contact you immediately have a nice day
327742 we have no phones in the store at the moment but there is a shipment on the way that we expect in a couple of hours
327743 oh well well do that when the phones get here
327744 you mean you will start a stampede right here in the store
327745 mike were you in line yesterday you were great come to the store and identify yourself there is a phone with your name on the box
327746 sure enough when i arrive at the store and show the elf my sunburn and my id thereby confirming my line cred he goes to the back and returns with a 16 giger with my name and phone number stuck on it
327747 this happened to some people on friday and i had an at amp t number to call to get it fixed
327748 but maam you have activated the account and i havent sold the phone yet so i cant reverse anything
327749 but there is no sim card in the 755p who knew isnt there any way you can undo the port
327750 matty is progressing and id like to keep him in there most of the time
327751 at this point in time his experience his consistency the way he goes about his business
327752 manny hasnt played right field in a long time and were not going to push that that being the case i think well look at juan in center field
327753 we worked hard all of these first couple months to get to this situation where we could get a chance to get to where we want to go and now weve kind of added another solution that could help solidify what were going for
327754 with that weve got to start focusing on that stuff and put all the individual stuff aside and just say this is what were going for and weve got a legitimate shot to do it and with this guy we can definitely say that were going to be a contender and can be a contender
327755 its important to protect manny its more important to have three guys ahead of him
327756 pitchers need to pitch to manny if men are on base and that will be tough for them
327757 im feeling good improving a lot faster than they anticipated well see what happens
327758 hes getting better but its still a long way for a shortstop to go left and right
327759 even though he may be able to play before the time its not at full strength he was resistant to it i explained last night after the game what my feeling is even though he can play with less than his best stuff at shortstop we want him as close to 100 percent as possible he understood that basically he took one for the team
327760 its kind of a confidence builder for the whole organization when you can bring your players up through the organization and they settle in and play its a sign that the system works
327761 every time you have a void at a position you dont want to have to go out on the free agent market you like to bring up your own players
327762 it seemed like left handers the rest of my career
327763 at the time it didnt really matter who i was facing i was just trying to get that hit and be comfortable up there
327764 pitchers in this league you gotta be able to throw your fastball for strikes and if youre hitting youve got to be able to hit the fastball i think the first three or four days probably out of nervousness and so forth he didnt catch up with some fastballs on the road trip he did
327765 early on in my career most of my home runs went out to left field
327766 then i started developing more of a swing to right field so this year and last year a lot of my balls went to right but i have a natural swing to left field
327767 the thing that i was very pleased with was that he really showed some discipline at the plate he wasnt swinging at a lot of bad pitches
327768 rather than swing at pitchers pitches he went a little deeper in the count thats something you really cant teach something about his approach to hitting allows that to happen and as you know we dont have a lot of that here we got guys who are pretty much hacking
327769 if they want to talk to me they know where im at i still have to be ready if the situation arises i feel like i will be
327770 you have to find enough work for him thats kind of difficult we consider him a starter and like the way he pitched were still trying to find whats best for our rotation
327771 this is better than being on the road in those places
327772 hes more aggressive he showed that he had good enough stuff and is capable of pitching a good game thats what guys have to show you when they come up
327773 i know a lot of guys start their careers in the bullpen at least they used to
327774 whatever it takes to stay ill do its their decision and ill respect whatever they decide i feel ive shown i can pitch in triple a so it would be nice to stay here obviously theyre going to do what they feel is right for the team
327775 a lot of people wouldnt think at this moment that i would have 10 wins in the american league
327776 nobody believed the team would be a half game behind first place at this point i think i did my job to help the team get to this position
327777 i have all the respect in the world for livan hes been a pleasure to have on my baseball team
327778 get rid of a guy that eats up innings like levo does there is always a risk you are making yourself a lot thinner
327779 we had originally talked about doing this last night we didnt want to take any of the air out of that clubhouse the right thing is for us to tell the player first face to face once in a while you dont get to do that
327780 i cant win because if i keep hernandez then i keep liriano in triple a youre going to ask why we were holding the other guy down there
327781 on both guys from day one it was all about winning baseball games all the other stuff has nothing to do with it
327782 i just want to say thank you to my teammates to the coaches to gardy and to the fans for their support theyre some of the best fans in baseball
327783 the rangers have the opposite problem we do theyre hitting has been good but their pitching has been so so with us our pitching has been good but our hitting has been so so
327784 youve baked a really lovely cake but then youve used dog shit for frosting
327785 we made the buttons on the screen look so good youll want to lick them
327786 it crashed on me the first time i ran it

327910 answering a question about his approach to combatting crime john mccain suggested that military strategies currently employed by us troops in iraq could be applied to high crime neighborhoods here in the us mccain called them tactics somewhat like we use in the military you go into neighborhoods you clamp down you provide a secure environment for the people that live there and you make sure that the known criminals are kept under control and you provide them with a stable environment and then they cooperate with law enforcement the way he described it his approach sounded an awful lot like the surge as part of his argument mccain praised the crime fighting efforts of former new york mayor rudolph giuliani urban league president marc morial countered that while new york did experience a drop in crime under giuliani there were several major instances of police misconduct to which mccain promised aggressive prosecution of civil rights violations and a justice department free from political cronyism

327918 the one that interested me the most was why dont we build we in our shipyard build four or five boats that look like iranian pt boats put navy seals on them with a lot of arms and next time one of our boats goes to the straits of hormuz start a shoot up
327919 in order to provoke an attack which could then be used to justify material breach
327920 the most extraordinary exchange takes place when lt gen michael delong bemoans shrinking political support for neo con war plans on capitol hill and suggests that sympathy for the bush administrations agenda will only be achieved after a new terror attack

327935 ms couillard may have put herself in jeopardy of having contravened a provision of the security of information act
327936 its a report done at the request of mr bernier for the benefit of mr bernier so im not surprised that the interpretations of these people went in that direction
327937 it has to be acknowledged that the incident itself was injurious to tarnishing canadas good reputation within nato circles for safeguarding classified information
327938 there was no occasion or reason for mr bernier to open his briefcase and he does not have any recollection of opening it during his stay at ms couillards
327939 the fact that they didnt interview ms couillard means that the report is frankly useless
327940 what they are seemingly trying to do here is to put the blame almost entirely on mme couillard
327941 there is no way he could have provoked that guy no way hes just not like that
327942 only in movies would you think something like this would happen not in real life not on a bus
327943 i dont really think about no 1 and at the moment i dont deserve it

327948 however arbitrary blocking and unblocking of certain sites does not fulfill the duty to comply with international standards of freedom of information and expression
327949 remains concerned that access is inconsistent and many internet sites remain off limits
327950 falls short of the promise made by the host and the international olympic committee of complete freedom for the media
327951 it continues to be unacceptable that the chinese government can decide according to its mood which websites are censored and which are accessible
327952 i dont think that politicizing the olympic games will do anything good to addressing any of the issues
327953 it goes against the shared aspirations of people from around the world
327954 theres no doubt that we do this having reflected long and hard and recognizing the deep concerns and frustrations that canada has gone through over the nuclear history with india
327955 but you cant keep somebody in the penalty box forever
327956 the way were looking at it is that our relationship has been underperforming if not in the doldrums completely for a couple of decades now if not more
327957 and indias come a long way in terms of democracy and the rule of law and the whole nuclear constellation of issues has evolved to the point where we just cant continue with our position that has been absolute and negative to allowing india back into the nuclear club as it were
327958 the benefit is not in non proliferation the benefit is in potential markets
327959 the frustration at canwest is that concerns about the companys debt will continue to overshadow improvements in operations
327960 we think the companies that weve bought have intrinsic values much higher than their stock prices
327961 ours is a long term investment so we dont get involved in the day to day chatter in the marketplace
327962 we question whether the public market will give canwest full value under the current capital structure and strategy direction of the company
327963 on this premise we believe the company should consider a privatization
327964 i go back to 2002 there was this massive fear about debt and the stock went down to the same price and we did what we said we were going to do we gradually worked away at the debt and we paid it off and the stock went up
327965 we think its got growth rate potential thats better than the multiples that people are ascribing to it would suggest

328124 after a thorough review of all the evidence testimony and facts of this case this court concludes the strongly expressed convictions of the trial court in this case may not be easily and objectively reconsidered
328125 it was clear that he had a point a view and we disagreed with it we tried the case and he cut us off at every pass
328126 ive never had something like this in my whole career and i hope i never do again
328127 in sum the trial court erred in ignoring the materiality prong and in misapplying the intent prong of the inequitable conduct test
328128 a new day has dawned everything that judge real did has been erased
328129 we look forward to going to trial for the first time and telling our story in court
328130 without making any findings regarding rule 23s requirements for class certification
328131 the prospect that the press might publish background stories about the jurors is not a legally sufficient reason to withhold the jurors names from the public although such stories might make some jurors less willing to serve or more distracted from the case this is a necessary cost of the openness of the judicial process
328132 sets a precedent of permitting our court to micro manage trial procedures established by the district courts
328133 requiring district courts to bow to media demands to know the names of prospective jurors would certainly impair the public good in many cases
328134 right to be free from double jeopardy mandates that a district judge exercise scrupulous and extraordinary care to be certain that there is no alternative to a mistrial
328135 give the defendant an opportunity to dissuade a judge from granting a mistrial even when doing so would not be an abuse of discretion
328136 it would be impossible for us to vindicate the publics asserted right of access if we foreclosed appeal of this matter until after the final judgment
328137 it appears that public knowledge of jurors names is a well established part of american judicial tradition
328138 instances of courts withholding jurors names appear to be very rare before the 1970s
328139 a tradition of openness exists and that anonymous juries have been the rare exception rather than the norm
328140 the prospect that the press might publish background stories about the jurors is not a legally sufficient reason to withhold the jurors names from the public although such stories might make some jurors less willing to serve or more distracted from the case this is a necessary cost of the openness of the judicial process
328141 that there is anything unusual about this case aside from a locally prominent defendant that makes the prospective jurors hypothetical privacy concerns more compelling than usual
328142 would allow judges to withhold the names of jurors in every case that might attract media attention
328143 the district courts reasoning would justify anonymity in virtually every jury trial whether or not it attracts media attention since almost all defendants have friends and enemies who might be inclined to influence jurors
328144 todays opinion will undoubtedly cause significant problems and delays in our district courts if the majoritys expansion of the collateral order doctrine and its announcement of a new constitutional right are permitted to stand
328145 the collective experience of courts over the last few decades in managing high profile trials is arguably more relevant than is the early development of the jury system

328187 we got stuck on the chairlift on virginia beach who was with her young son said she was leaving her car keys and stroller with her sister on the ground
328188 were giving her the keys in case we get stuck for five hours we are proceeding with caution
328189 now that by normal peoples thinking is a malfunction a gun that jams even after its fired a small burst is hardly a controllable firearm thats a gun that needs fixing
328190 but according to the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives batf that is a machine gun and they got a jury to buy that
328191 they didnt tell the jury that their witness the fellow who had borrowed the gun had been paid repeatedly by the federal government
328192 they didnt tell the jury that they had back dated the second lab test so that it would pre date the criminal complaint against mr
328193 the problem is the other copy of the letter that was sent to the manufacturer burned up when the factory burned down in 2000
328194 so we werent able to get a copy of the letter and the batf just folded their arms and said you cant have it
328195 in the printed edition of vegas magazine brittany also talks about her new movie black water transit where she claims she wears nothing the entire time and has sex with everyone
328196 hey i can still get down and throw down and im not about to retire
328197 about five minutes into the show he whispered in my ear this would be great in las vegas he liked the show he laughed and he sang along and he enjoyed it and at the end he said it reminded him very much of the 60s when he went into broadway and he had gone to see nichols and may those are my two collective heroes and the reason i went into python this musical is of course lovingly ripped off from the movie monty python and the holy grail which was made in 1975 for about 400 000 on the musical that is less than the lawyers cost but to come to the stage it needed quite a bit of changing we did about 17 drafts over 4 years but it made its money back after six months on broadway it was the big winner in london and we have a touring company that is really doing well everywhere
328198 i thought it was an extraordinary show and i thought it was so funny i had not laughed as hard at a broadway musical since the first time i saw noises off back in the 80s i described spamalot as the show that if you laugh too long you miss the next joke it just doesnt stop and that is why i wanted to do it i wasnt thinking about vegas and lo and behold they said we are opening up in vegas and they asked if i would be in it i thought what a dream when my wife and i were in new york i went to see every other show because i really wanted to see what else was out there i circled two roles and i said to my wife i have got to do these roles one was the lead in dirty rotten scoundrels which closed before i got a hold of it and the other was the king in spamalot so it is easy to hop over to the executive airport and go home in la in just 45 minutes this has been an extraordinary thing and ill be full time through the summer here in vegas but then i go back in september and film we are shooting family feud again ill also be doing a new nbc show and believe it or not theres even a new one too but i cant talk about that one yet so in some cases i will be leaving vegas at midnight flying back to shoot the next day and then flying back here to do the spamalot show again that same night these are the gravy years this is the time you do the things to give you greater freedom later in life so while the opportunities are there i am going to embrace them
328199 much has been written that maybe las vegas is not the place for comedy and musical theater the people come here from the midwest and around the world and they want spectacle they want big exciting things and maybe the musical theater isnt right for vegas over a period of years we have learned from the press and so we said why not face the inevitable and lets end it so we looked for the perfect piece of material to put a final chapter of theater into las vegas
328200 there is a reality to these hotels in vegas there is a certain amount of space and there are certain things you can do we said well if we could do spamalot in the grail theater where avenue q was we would be able to preserve our convention and meeting space instead of building a third theater i must confess that i am ashamed of myself that i did it because of the money and the planning the decision was taken to abbreviate the stay of q we wanted to bring to this city something that hasnt really been done before we believe that vegas is a rich and mature enough community to also exploit wit and this theater was built to be that place in this city where humor and wit prevail i said to eric the night i went to spamalot for the first time this is the easiest entertainment decision i have made in 40 years las vegas would understand it and they would love it we are committed to the show for as long as the public likes it
328201 only a couple of songs went all for one which we needed because we had a costume change for all the girls to get ready for the spamalot number
328202 i was very nervous about opening in london i wasnt sure which way they would jump
328203 i dont think we have added more vegas elements to it just because we are in vegas i realized that we couldnt improve or change the show because its so big and gross and over the top already we can only stay true to what we already do well that is part of the charm of it i am sure our vegas audiences will laugh like theyve never laughed before i find for me that it is more fun to work on python that anything else i tried to do a live reunion here in 1988 and we got very close we got an offer dates a hotel and then michael palin at the last minute said no he didnt want to do it it is scary to go back into the world of silliness but its essential to keep challenging yourself now though i dont think it will ever happen and thats why spamalot is so alive and well and keeping python alive and well too
328204 the material is wacky and absurd irreverent and politically incorrect which is how you would describe las vegas actually
328205 this is the show i should have done twenty years ago this is the dream come true
328206 the spirit of the great crooner is back in town
328207 are you lonesome tonight that elvis song and i pinspot barry and i said
328208 vegas will be the best speedway complex in the world this week
328209 las vegas is the entertainment capital of the world so we have to be the biggest and best
328210 its a perspective on the sport of auto racing that has never been available to race fans before call it adding the entertainment element race fans get the opportunity to see their favorite drivers up close and that strong relation ship is really alive and well at lvms
328211 what this deduction does is say that almost 10 percent of the profits manufacturers earn cant be taxed
328212 we are up against well financed business interests who say we just want to raise taxes on business and can afford run expensive marketing campaigns to keep the deduction
328213 manufacturing employs 675 000 people in illinois and we contribute 13 percent to the states gross domestic product illinois manufacturers have lost 200 000 jobs since 2000 every time the general assembly or the governor try to eliminate an incentive like this it just hurts those 675 000 workers
328214 you have to remain competitive with the states around us im not talking about giving away the bank you know you are in trouble when states around us advertise how much better they are for business than illinois
328215 nascar has grown into the fastest growing sport in all of america
328216 we are only behind the nfl as far as television ratings last years event drew over 170 million dollars in one time expenditures here in southern nevada that economic rollover computes somewhere to a billion dollar impact on the local economy so everybody locally gets excited about it because it brings so many people to town the beds gaming tables the shows and the restaurants are full it is just a great weekend not just for las vegas motor speedway but also for southern nevada and the danger has a lot to do with it
328217 i wanted to take it to the next level of fan interactivity and no other sport in the world lets you get this close it literally is being in the locker room this has all turned out better than i expected i love what i see it makes me feel real proud to have everybody coming up and congratulating me they love it it is totally unique this puts us 10 years ahead of anybody else were in vegas and we wanted to be part of what its all about so our new facilities match the citys glamour and excitement now it revolutionizes the sport it makes it more fan friendly 12 000 people this weekend in the neon garage area almost touch the drivers hands watch over their shoulders as they work on their cars and thats important because its what we set out to achieve
328218 our new banking will increase the speed by about 18mph therell be above 200mph in places but the qualifying speed wile about 191mph we have safe walls so we hope no more danger but certainly a lot more entertaining for the fans the turning radius is a little more than any other track although there are pother tracks with bigger banking than atlanta and texas but there will be guys going through those turns going a complete lap without ever lifting their foot off the accelerator on the straight aways therell be getting above 200mph we have the worlds best drivers for our vegas racing weekend
328219 were tickled to death its turned out more spectacular state of the art and ahead of every other track in the world its the most dazzling makeover anywhere and in time for our 10th anniversary the entire project we hd no idea it would be as nice as it is brutons vision has been totally manifested the fans now get something here unlike anything else in the world the race fan always comes first lets give the fan to get close to the heroes of the sport while they are going about their business the race fan is so close to the stars as they work live and in person a few feet away theyll be able to peer right into see jeff gordon dale earnhardt jr kyle busch going about their business itll take some getting used to by the teams with the fans literally looking over their shoulders while they are tightening the engine parts fans will be able to come into the garage and look down at the cars as a surgeons class would be able to look down at an operation they will be able to see jeff gordon come out and talk to his crew chief about what needs to be done to the race car and watch the race team work on the race car it is going to bring a whole new element to las vegas we will have created the most wonderful sports facility center anywhere and well do it in the greatest city anywhere
328220 speeds will increase but were actually looking for the increased competition
328221 when the drivers are happy the fans are unhappy when the drivers are unhappy the fans are having a great time and theyre sure going to have a better time in las vegas from now on
328222 we have tremendous sight lines at las vegas motor speedway wonderful backdrop mountains on the eastside of lv and off in the distance the las vegas strip you have the fan from small town usa that comes here to watch nascar and returns to the strip to downtown and gets to enjoy all that las vegas has to offer whether it is a show the gaming or the great restaurants that we have it has got to be the number one attraction in all motor sports to come to las vegas for nascar weekend there is no better place no other city to get this

328236 graphene is a great material for electronics but it would be even better if it were possible to create devices with crystallographic edges that is edges where the atoms lie along single lines in the graphene plane
328237 standard etching techniques being used in the semiconductor industry do not allow this sort of fabrication instead they produce rough edges with lots of atomic scale defects that limit the performance of the fabricated devices
328238 one major advantage is the appearance of the glasses because they look almost like normal everyday spectacles it is more likely that visually impaired people will use them
328239 the short height of the actual magnifier its position and inclusion of a small tilt of the last flat mirror the one closest to the users eye enables the wearer to simultaneously view the magnified field above the unmagnified view of the uninterrupted horizontal field
328240 this large epidemiologic study shows for the first time a consistent and robust association between a high blood level of alkaline phosphatase and cardiovascular death in thousands of dialysis patients across the united states
328241 if the association between alkaline phosphatase and mortality has a causal link treatment strategies that reduce alkaline phosphatase levels may improve survival in patients with ckd and probably in many other patients with chronic diseases and active bone disorders
328242 in dialysis patients increased levels of alkaline phosphatase in the blood indicate a so called high turnover bone disease which can happen due to hormonal imbalance in ckd
328243 alkaline phosphatase has recently been shown to be associated with increased vascular calcification in experimental studies
328244 our study shows the clinical manifestations of this association in real world patients
328245 for the ultimate proof of causation treatment trials are needed to target high bone turnover diseases to reduce serum alkaline phosphatase effectively and then to ascertain whether these interventions can improve survival
328246 it seems like the boom and bust cycle would have lost its romantic appeal to people by now
328247 vermont women and or their health care providers may more readily pursue evaluation of symptoms and clinical findings than their norwegian counterparts
328248 our results demonstrate that despite its longer screening inter val the organized population based screening program in norway achieved similar outcomes as the opportunistic screening in vermont
328249 you observe animals using the sense of smell to find food and you assume that this sensory modality must be important for survival but what we wanted to do is demonstrate it scientifically and in a rigorously controlled way
328250 if smell is so important then why are these odor blind animals doing as well as the animals that have a very good nose
328251 when the first cup of food was exhausted the animals with the normal sense of smell started to forage and very efficiently found that second cup much more so than those with the simple nose
328252 the odor blind animals didnt have a sense of smell to guide them
328253 its a simple demonstration that in times of plenty the sense of smell is irrelevant for survival
328254 but in times of scarcity when you really need to use that sensory modality to forage for food those without it have a competitive disadvantage
328255 heart failure patients experience high rates of hospital stays and poor outcomes
328256 by utilizing this model we can more quickly identify patients at risk for in hospital mortality who might benefit from more aggressive monitoring and intervention
328257 despite numerous advances in the treatment of chronic heart failure more work is needed to reduce the high risk of mortality for patients hospitalized for heart failure
328258 an essential next step is to study whether applying this risk prediction score will favorably impact patient care and clinical outcomes
328259 on the whole our findings suggest that marriage is a better predictor of parenting quality with regard to social fathers than biological fathers
328260 our study is relevant to understanding the quality of parental care that children receive from resident fathers across a range of family configurations that are now commonly experienced by children
328261 the exciting part of this study is that we have discovered a completely new process that regulates the adverse responses to bad memories
328262 these findings can help the development of new drugs to treat conditions in which people are haunted by persistent fears such as posttraumatic stress disorder or other panic disorders
328263 unexpressed concerns are challenging because they can lead to different expectations and understanding of the problems patients are concerned about and treatment recommendations that are poorly tailored to patient needs
328264 physicians will have little chance to correct or modify them unfortunately unexpressed concerns may contribute to breakdowns in communication which are frustrating for both physicians and patients
328265 knowing that older adults frequently dont voice all their concerns should help surgeons create opportunities for patients who are reluctant to bring them up
328266 at the moment there are a great many people with hepatitis c who have no treatment options left and it would transform their lives if we could prevent them from developing liver failure we are looking forward to seeing the results of our upcoming trial in humans now that weve had such promising results in the trial in mice
328267 if we have positive results from the new trial we will have a potential treatment that is already available and very cheap and which should be safe enough for people to take if we are successful in hepatitis c patients we are hopeful that such treatment might benefit people with liver damage from other causes and this is something we would be keen to study further
328268 we showed we could block behavior in mice that resembles this increased euphoria even after the animals had been given a lot of alcohol
328269 thats what you want in a treatment because we dont get to people until after they become addicted to alcohol
328270 i think if you block this receptor you might be able to decrease drinking in response to ptsd
328271 this system may be useful for the fly to navigate the olfactory landscape odor concentrations can change very dramatically and this is how they deal it
328272 we applied natural odors to the antennae odors that the fly would normally smell
328273 its like evolution has taken advantage of the system to adjust some channels up and down without affecting other channels
328274 if you want high sensitivity to co 2 then you can eliminate the feedback receptor in those neurons for other odors such as pheromone which is important for finding other flies a good tracking system is needed
328275 flies that lack inhibition in their pheromone sensing neurons often fail to find the female
328276 the control flies are strikingly different soon after they get accustomed to the new arena they zoom in on the female and immediately start courting her
328277 relay stations are much smaller than base stations and are much easier to deploy they can be fixed onto lamp posts for example
328278 they also should only cost around one fifth of the price as the intelligence is in the base station and unlike base stations they do not require a directed backhaul connection to the internet

328282 what is involved in these procedures is often unclear since recognised clinical nomenclature is not being used
328283 the real risks of potential complications such as scarring permanent disfigurement infection dyspareunia and altered sexual sensations should be discussed in detail with women seeking such treatments the college is particularly concerned that such surgery may exploit vulnerable women

328321 aura hanya bisa mengucapkan terima kasih ketika banyak yang menilainya seksi terima kasih kalau ada orang yang bilang seksi aku sih menganggapnya sebagai bonus karena aku lebih suka dibilang seksi itu kalau dari
328322 i knew i had to get out of the house
328323 all i had on was bikini underwear and a tank top
328324 im going to get her a special treat a can of salmon thats 2
328325 my only thought on that is he would take that only if he thought there was no way he could play
328326 because he doesnt want to go sit on the bench thats not him he wants to play football if he sees no chance of that i think thats the only way he would consider it and i think thats why hes considering it
328327 i think he really and truly wants to play football
328328 i dont think its about the money a guy that has as much money as he has but im not in his position hes kind of caught in limbo there a little bit
328329 i wasnt surprised that they might offer him a lifetime job but the money thing kind of surprised me
328330 people are saying theyre paying him to kind of go away thats kind of surprising to me that it came to that i never knew you could hold a player hostage that just wants to play football
328331 if bob harlan and mike holmgren and ron wolf were there i dont think this would ever happen like this
328332 i think green bay has more to worry about it than we do we just answer the questions but were not thinking about it at all we know who our quarterback is and whos on our team
328333 ive talked to the media probably after every practice and ive had one question about kicking
328334 not that it wears on you but its certainly something where youd like to see a resolution or an end point sooner than later
328335 cuarenta y ocho a os m s tarde la invasi n sali de su retiro y se expuso al mundo quiz haya algo de vanidad en eso y la verdad es que se siente uno extra o por los halagos le agradezco much simo al jurado
328336 cuando sal de mi pa s cuando me fui a nueva york y cuando llegu a puerto rico
328337 ese grupo de hombres se sinti tan fuerte que sometieron a la gente a los dictados de su desnudez y por ah siguieron intentando conquistar el mundo lo escrib en un ambiente de penetraci n ideol gica fuerte en mi pa s con ideas del marxismo y el leninismo y trat de configurarlo de un manera jocosa
328338 we were able to follow up on this lead and it was a dead end
328339 a man who uses his hands is a laborer one who uses his hands and mind is a craftsman he who uses his hands and his mind and his heart is an artist
328340 oh tristan treats me terribly hes so mean i could just about cry
328341 while some might have chosen to exhaust their legal options to try to force their way into the games jessica instead chose to put her teams interests ahead of her own
328342 ive never wanted to do anything remotely close to doping its never ever crossed my mind ive never been approached about doing it its never been an issue my entire career its the last thing i would ever do
328343 its hard because i know theyre starting the process of however they do that but whenever i start thinking about it i let my mind go i get up and do something else i may grab a workout or go for a drive because i dont want to think about it
328344 eight hundred fifteen catches is going to be 815 in 09 010 011 012 or 013 ten thousand yards is going to be whatever it is three super bowl wins are going to be three super bowl wins i cant get any more numbers or better numbers and if they thought i did well enough itll happen if not it wont
328345 id be shocked if hes not a first year eligible pick
328346 look it up look at the super bowls look at the stats look at wins everything you want in a tight end hes already accomplished
328347 youve seen some of the guys you thought would be slam dunks and they werent slam dunks
328348 its always puzzled me because if a players voted among the best of his era he should be among the best of his generation but thats not always the case and a lot of all decade players have fallen through the cracks
328349 right now hes the top tight end in the history of the game
328350 but i caution people against putting guys in as first ballot hall of famers because theres a lot of good candidates and only a few spots and whether theyre a hall of famer the first fifth or 29th time it doesnt matter what ballot they get in everybodys in
328351 we dont have t d we dont win two super bowls
328352 anybody thats been with denver knows what type of career he had but the type of playoffs he had was off the charts you look at what kind of games he had in big time playoff games every playoff game but there are always arguments for players that played a short career
328353 i know mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
328354 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
328355 the commissioner will take no action today on brett favres reinstatement request discussions are continuing between the packers and brett
328356 there isnt a perfect solution to this but mark murphy is at least trying
328357 we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end
328358 you could hand me a billion dollars and im still going to be on the field
328359 it doesnt matter to me but everyone has different situations has different views on money money is not more important than football to me right now
328360 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
328361 hes not a part of our 80 man roster right now
328362 and if or when he is well deal with that then and i think our team has done a great job of just staying focused
328363 theyve got nothing to talk about so they want to fire something up
328364 but youve got to be lucky and dont have the injuries weve had if we dont have the injuries id be very disappointed if we didnt make the playoffs
328365 you rarely see a coach guaranteeing a playoff berth usually its an immature young player who doesnt know what hes talking about
328366 but when a coach says that its a call to all the players and coaches that hey this is what i expect and if you dont do it either im gone or everybody else is going to be gone its a direct challenge to the players to step it up when the coach says that you better do it
328367 hes expecting a lot out of us and at the same time were expecting a lot out of the coaching staff to put us in position to win
328368 thats our goal and we expect nothing less than that
328369 our reports said he learned very well and hes done it
328370 at boise state he had some prerequisites to pass blocking that hes developed even further here
328371 because it takes the judgment out of it it makes it easier on everybody
328372 theres a certain self absorption that comes with whats going on
328373 you really need to focus on what youre doing and get better you cant get caught up in anything other than that
328374 i feel really comfortable outside ive always played outside even in college so its something im used to
328375 were going to enjoy watching the playoffs from the beach
328376 the last two weeks have been stressful or really since the start of july because thats when the deadlines started ticking
328377 ive been working and working on the speech but just the anticipation of it all and really not knowing how the hall of famers will accept you
328378 theyre coming for a party they dont have much pressure on them they get the best of both worlds they dont have to get up and embarrass themselves
328379 we have been looking around to try to get people for the right areas of the pitch that we want to improve on
328380 the good thing about madjid is that he can play in two positions which is an important factor for us
328381 but we are still looking around to add one or two to the squad
328382 we are delighted to add madjid our squad he is a player who came highly recommended to us and we had a good look at him last year
328383 it took us a little bit of time to get the deal in place but we have done so now
328384 he can play as a central defender and as a midfield player so we think he will be a really good addition to our squad
328385 its not the greatest appeal but it does appeal to us that he can play in a couple of positions and thats something we take into consideration
328386 when you are trying to add to your squad you hope to do so prior to starting your competitive games
328387 but because of the fact we had to start so early its not always possible to get that done
328388 there are teams who are not always prepared to let a player go before they know they can get one to cover
328389 so its not easy at this time in the season when you consider there are still four weeks before the transfer deadline
328390 the financial gap has been there now and its apparent it has been there now for a number of years its just something that we have to get on with
328391 i dont think its stopping us from competing if you look at celtic qualifying out the group stages of the champions league two years in a row and ourselves getting to the uefa cup final last year
328392 we have shown that we are able to compete but on financial terms we cant and we know that thats something that has to be accepted by everyone and we just have to get on with it
328393 as managers its our job to try to win football matches and thats what we have to do
328394 its more than evident that clubs from smaller countries throughout europe can no longer compete on financial terms with clubs from the bigger countries
328395 when you see the teams who nearly always feature in the final of the champions league and who have a great deal of success they are from the bigger countries who spend a great deal of money
328396 britney and lee hit it off immediately he is her perfect type she loves guys who work out and he is in great shape from his days serving in the israeli army he also has a few tattoos which she loves theyve spent so much time together that one thing led to another and their relationship became physical they are in mexico together theyve been having a great time lees put a smile on her face

328404 it does look like they have support of the shareholders again but at the end of the day they have to focus on the company goals and execute
328405 i think you overpaid on compensation i think you overplayed your hand with microsoft and i think you overstayed your welcome after last years vote and should do the honorable thing and step down from this board
328406 with all the hoopla with all of the publicity that has surrounded the company in the past six months there has been a great deal of misunderstanding
328407 the board controlled the process of dealing with microsoft right from the beginning we called the shots and were deeply involved in every step
328408 yahoo is attempting to rewrite history yet again with statements that are not supported by the facts
328409 a girlfriend who was involved in a breakup is now trying to convince the world she was the initiator and not the victim
328410 this is a very global business and yahoo is very well positioned
328411 yahoo has a sad history of complicity with violating human rights by turning over information to the

328414 we decided to avoid a looming proxy battle with carl and frankly we are looking forward to working with him
328415 he is a smart guy and some say a good guy despite the things that are written about him

328421 the jews learned from history to take advantage of the great opportunity america gives to participate in politics
328422 after the fec act the role of fundraisers changed to laying the groundwork for a funding infrastructure for a network
328423 there is no doubt that part of what makes the jewish community so good at fundraising is a certain philanthropic ethic
328424 were thrilled to be able to feature these pictures in people
328425 they will delight our readers who have followed the growth of the jolie pitt family
328426 the jolie pitt family and getty images have agreed that all proceeds will be used for charitable purposes
328427 you know she wasnt the kind that played with dolls and then all of the sudden she has all of these children
328428 theyre healthy and theyre doing well and im so happy and of course the parents are really happy and over the moon its a wonderful time
328429 well were all just raisin mccain everywhere across the usa you can get on the train or get out of the way were all just raisin mccain
328430 he asked that his privacy and that of his family is respected while he gets well
328431 hes got a chance to play and hes got a chance to not be healthy enough to play
328432 i wouldnt anticipate him being there for the opener or being there as a backup for games in september but i dont know how long it would be
328433 and i both want the same thing and the team wants the same thing
328434 for him to go out and play hes got to go out like jimmy dray and have total confidence in that knee that any direction he cuts moves no matter what pressure he puts on it thats hes going to be confident
328435 thats my goal i wouldnt train for this any other way my rehab is going well ive been cleared to start training and strengthening and im very excited
328436 i hope i can begin practicing in a couple of weeks i need to build muscle i just got cleared to start running doing underwater treadmill work and then i can get on the grass and get going
328437 i wasnt in six so it has been a long hiatus for me and i cant wait to get back in that world
328438 it is easy to get back into the mind of lucius i just put on the wig the thing about that wig is that it is long and straight and the only way to get it straight is to tilt my head back and then im forced to look down my nose at people and suddenly lucius is back in town

328443 i like jerry but i think a new ceo is needed
328444 it would have been nice if they announced other directors were leaving or announced the icahn nominees
328445 a good development but i dont think hes the full solution
328446 i might have to cut my losses i voted against the entire board
328447 i think jerry and david filo are to be congratulated for what theyve created but i dont think jerry is the guy for the day to day ceo role
328448 its too bad former intel ceo and chairman andy grove isnt 30 years younger

328452 weve been struggling for a long time and it has just gotten worse
328453 honestly we hate it when this s happens because we want our fans to have any new songs first
328454 1 0 not bad especially when you consider thats its pretty much the same price as the previous version of the gtx
328455 the sheriffs department has now released information that the other vehicle ran the red light while striking shias truck
328456 received information that suggests that the other driver may have been traveling upwards of 50 miles per hour and that said driver may not have been looking forward at the time of the accident
328457 we are very appreciative again of the patience that everyone has shown us and of the many concerned citizens who have stepped forward to provide information regarding this collision
328458 is responding well to treatment and will be released soon
328459 is in a phase which it hasnt been in the last four years
328460 there are too many people who have been there too long and we need new management from outside
328461 we hope to create friendly robots that can exist side by side with people
328462 winglet will help everyone move around safely and stay active
328463 within the context of a very difficult operating environment ba management is doing all the right things
328464 it is managing fares up cutting capacity and seeking strategic tie ups that will provide future synergies that will allow it to inch its way back to economic returns
328465 it is absolutely unavoidable that as hedging unwinds we will have to reflect the significant increase in the price of oil in our fares
328466 if people are concerned about jobs that can only be good news
328467 we see new fuel efficient aircraft as being a critical part of the answer to high oil prices
328468 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
328469 he was a great person he was kind thoughtful and he did not deserve this i feel for his parents and sisters and his lil bro
328470 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
328471 he had a rambo hunting knife covered in blood and he just kept going at the guy
328472 he was very calmly killing the guy and the other guy was screaming bloody murder
328473 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
328474 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen obama did
328475 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
328476 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
328477 a city really none of us were comfortable walking in the streets to one that was basically safe
328478 the best equal opportunity employer in the country is the u s military
328479 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
328480 its clearly the case that for a variety of reasons families are facing hardship
328481 if they have any redness in their complexion the warmth will counteract it
328482 a gente j viveu momentos como esse mais o grupo forte e vai dar a volta por cima
328483 but you know i get to feeling a hundred per cent ill be ready to kick his a ill kick somebodys a ill just start with him
328484 we need to kind of scare them a little bit
328485 were not here to beg i told the preacher were not here to beg anything were asking and were going to be nice about it from here on out there will be action taken
328486 they doing dope big time sheriff but heres their only problem they know how to get it out of the country i know how to get the money back in
328487 you didnt get that from me rev i dont know nothing about it
328488 all i can tell you reverend is be damn careful
328489 you take a thousand out of there no no no its 24 24 thats what he said thats what im going to do
328490 if you or i had any intention of defrauding the government of a couple of million dollars wed be thrown in jail
328491 why arent the executives facing such charges for having defrauded the government of billions of dollars
328492 you didnt have to go very far to get an illegal carton of cigarettes for half the cost of what they would be selling at the retail level
328493 if i couldnt go to a tap and get a drink of water i dont know what id do
328494 i dont really give it much thought actually i figure north battlefords got to have clean water bottled water just doesnt taste the same
328495 big city water in this country is absolutely fine but the problem with assuring safe potable water is that it takes a minimum degree of microbiological knowledge and engineering skill and a supporting infrastructure
328496 doing that requires you have a large enough customer base so you can afford the high quality relatively expensive services
328497 ontario is a paragon of sanity compared to british columbia where you have a third of the population and 4 000 water suppliers
328498 every small town every little place has its own jealously guarded water systems most of which have inadequate treatment
328499 the real problem with canadian drinking water quality is we have far too many rinky dink suppliers and theyre too small to produce the level of safety that our society seems to demand
328500 they can have effects on reproduction some pharmaceuticals estrogens testosterone some pesticides the endocrine system is the one that produces hormones and it is very very sensitive and there are chemicals in the water that influence the endocrine system of fish
328501 i think the reproductive effects are potentially important and we do hear about human fertility issues sperm count in males decreasing problems with learning difficulties in children allergies asthma cancers there are so many things we dont have an explanation for
328502 those systems will catch quite a few numbers of nasties like oils and very complex large chain molecules like pcbs they dont do well at all with these endocrine disruptors
328503 most pesticides and fertilizers that get into our streams and rivers never pass through a sewage treatment plant it is really really serious
328504 were aware the issue surfaced as an outbreak in nunavut in the past year and theyve had the problems with this in alaska
328505 so its something im keeping a close eye on and we want to find out more about how this germ is spreading and what the best approach might be
328506 the more water a household has access to their health status seems to improve in proportion to that
328507 hospitalizations for influenza and pneumonia skin and soft tissue infections so these would be boils and abscesses in the skin and also among children a very common viral infection called rsv all of those were more common causes of hospitalization in regions where water service wasnt as well established
328508 the more difficult issue is what combinations of common low dose chemical exposures might be contributing to these problems
328509 acid reflux occurs when the acidic contents of the stomach pass up into the esophagus and the sphincter muscle the barrier between the two has a defect so it cannot block the acid
328510 the lining of the esophagus is not made to resist acid its very different from the stomach so acid reflux can cause ulcers and inflammation and a whole host of other problems
328511 there are certain lifestyle things we tell people to avoid
328512 alcohol consumption increases the risk of acid reflux as well as caffeine so do foods like chocolates and tomatoes or tomato based products if you have mild symptoms and can avoid these things you might be able to avoid medicines
328513 the thing that should be taken away is that acid reflux isnt going to kill you
328514 why we actually look down your throat into your esophagus with a scope is because it can cause other problematic conditions
328515 thats the test where we really saw the most striking effects with estradiol

328521 we can confirm the death of a british national in goiania in brazil
328522 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
328523 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
328524 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
328525 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
328526 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
328527 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
328528 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
328529 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
328530 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
328531 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
328532 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
328533 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
328534 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
328535 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
328536 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
328537 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
328538 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
328539 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
328540 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
328541 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
328542 innocent is that supposed to be funny look at the people i killed an obese man a disgusting man who could barely stand up who if you saw him on the street youd point so your friends could mock him along with you who if you saw him while you were eating you wouldnt be able to finish your meal after him i picked the lawyer and you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one this was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets a woman so ugly on the inside that she couldnt bare to go on living if she couldnt be beautiful on the outside a drug dealer a drug dealing pederast actually and dont forget the disease spreading whore only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face thats the point you see a deadly sin on almost every street corner and in every home literally and we tolerate it because its common it seems trivial and we tolerate all day long morning noon and night not anymore im setting the example and its going to be puzzled over and studied and followed from now on
328543 ive filled in an application form to join you on the shop floor just as soon as i leave school
328544 why notmost of my friends who are leaving this term have already been accepted by triumph and they cant wait to get started
328545 come off it dad the pays good and youve shown that theres always plenty of extra money to be picked up with overtime and i dont mind hard work
328546 do you think i spent all those years making sure you got a first class education just to let you end up like me putting wheels on cars for the rest of your life
328547 thats not the whole job and you know it dad
328548 i dont care what your friends end up doing i only care about you you could be a solicitor an accountant an army officer even a schoolmaster why should you want to end up at a car factory
328549 my french master once told me that he wasnt as well off as you
328550 the point is dad i cant be expected to spend the rest of my life doing a job i dont enjoy just to satisfy one of your fantasies
328551 well im not going to allow you to waste the rest of your life
328552 the first thing im going to do when i get in to work this morning is see that your application is turned down
328553 at least youd have a roof over your head and be regularly fed
328554 i know im going to be no 1 getting no 1 is a present for a lot of work in the past so its satisfying
328555 the important thing is that i continue to play well continue to win
328556 i thought that i was serving much better and day after day im getting stronger in the segment of my game which is really important coming up to the final stages of the tournament
328557 it was a little bit uncomfortable for a few points
328558 he was playing too well and my game was not up to scratch

328600 there is no way in our aviation history in this state that weve saved or rescued that many people at once

328603 todays students are bombarded with television images video games and magazine articles newspapers that give importance to conflict and war violence has become commonplace and accepted as part of our society and for some students it is a way of life it is our hope that through the pinwheels for peace project we can help the students make a public visual statement about their feelings about war peace tolerance cooperation harmony unity and in some way maybe awaken the public and let them know what the next generation is thinking

328607 theres no doubt that when it comes to our treatment of native americans as well as other persons of color in this country weve got some very sad and difficult things to account for
328608 i personally would want to see our tragic history or the tragic elements of our history acknowledged
328609 i consistently believe that when it comes to whether its native americans or african american issues or reparations the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds

328621 the mccain camp doesnt meaning for the last couple of weeks all you have heard from them is about britney spears and paris hilton
328622 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
328623 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
328624 i will keep the moratorium in place and prevent oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts
328625 i think its important for the american people to understand were not going to drill our way out of this problem
328626 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
328627 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
328628 it seems like we are in a close race in florida you dont just say people voted one way if you dont show up you dont get the vote

328663 teaming up with the raiders is a magnificent opportunity for chabot space amp science center we are both celebrated oakland institutions who share a commitment to excellence and community involvement and its probably not coincidental that we both know a thing or two about black holes
328664 the museum is delighted with our new partnership with the legendary oakland raiders were excited about having a presence at this seasons home games and the chance to give raider fans and their families the good word about the museum like the raiders we support and promote oakland thats who we are the oakland museum of california
328665 from day one the linebackers were dominating the running backs in pass protection
328666 both yesterday and today weve seen a major change and thats credited to those guys taking on the coaching and being more physical and having a good attitude about it
328667 running backs coach tom rathman starts at eight in the morning on the days we have pass protection drills
328668 he is thinking about it hours before we have the drill to make sure his players are ready to go
328669 blocking has really been a point of emphasis so far in training camp
328670 weve got a big time quarterback behind us and giving him time and space is essential to being successful
328671 for the backs going up and blocking the linebackers is our main concern
328672 were going to do what we need to keep guys off of the running backs
328673 weve certainly had the biggest challenge going up against future pro bowlers like linebackers kirk morrison and thomas howard
328674 we spend a lot of time working on our placement and movements when to turn inside or outside and how we can offer the most amount of protection
328675 he has looked great he is really showing a lot of leadership in the huddle and in the classroom
328676 with s michael huff being a shadow right next to him he is paying off extremely well for us with his play but also with his affect on the rest of the secondary
328677 we all come from different systems but we all have to get to know each other
328678 i have to know what nnamdi is thinking at all times ive got to know what page huff and deangelo are on its just one of those things that we need to know where we all are and play off each other then it will be great
328679 weve only been out here for five days but ultimately you can tell from the practices that he has great communication and he is very smart
328680 every day i am learning new things especially being in a new environment
328681 my main motivation at camp is to get better everyday and challenge myself everyday ive got to keep challenging myself
328682 i have to learn the style of each of these guys we have no choice but to pick it up right away
328683 honda civic sir 1999 has to be one of the all time greatest cars ever made it has several minor flaws but all are made up for by two things
328684 as far as todays practice it was probably our most physical practice of camp
328685 we ran about 85 team plays today it was good to sting them a little bit this morning and i think they responded well they were physical and it was good to see
328686 we did have a longer team period today than we usually do that was just to challenge them
328687 we wanted to challenge them and add more plays to see how they would respond i think they responded great i didnt hear them complain about it they just went to work
328688 yeah it was very physical out there today but i liked it
328689 the pace has been good and the tempo has been good were just trying to clean some stuff up
328690 i think darren mcfadden continues to make a play or two every day a wow play we just have to continue to push him as far as we can and we have to find ways to get him the ball

328701 a municipal assembly member who had heard the news on the radio appears to have inquired of staff but we have received no communications from the central government and the city government has yet to gain any knowledge

328708 i have had so many mostly estate agents from austria neighbouring bavaria and germany
328709 we manage most of the austrian lakes so by principle were interested in taking over the mondsee

328712 we went to give our psychological support to the ex president who is going through a bad moment
328713 jail privileges different to those of the other inmates in his category
328714 we are surprised and disappointed with this action especially given that sugammadex received a unanimous recommendation for approval by the fda advisory committee on anesthetics and life support in march of this year
328715 sugammadex represents the first major pharmaceutical innovation in the field of anesthesia in two decades we remain committed to bringing this important medical advance to those who are waiting for it in the united states and plan to work with the agency to address the issues which are primarily related to hypersensitivity allergic reactions

328717 barack obama may be the one but is he ready to lead
328718 senator mccain can keep telling everyone how proud he is of these political stunts which even his republican friends and advisors have called childish but barack obama will continue talking about his plan to jumpstart our economy by giving working families 1 000 dollars of immediate relief
328719 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
328720 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
328721 excuse me young man this is going to be a question and answer session so you can ask a question later
328722 why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african american community or black community in this country
328723 i think youre misinformed when you say not one time
328724 every issue that youve spoken about i actually did speak out of
328725 im sure theres a way we can find common ground
328726 congress passed important legislation that will further efforts to obtain fair compensation for american citizens in their claims against the libyan government
328727 we hope administration efforts working with the congress will help our fellow citizens close a painful chapter in their lives
328728 the united states also looks forward to expanding its relationship with libya and its people as we resolve contentious issues from the past
328729 decision by congress provides a powerful incentive now to libya to proceed
328730 its agreed in principle how its going to happen so that should take place pretty quickly ideally
328731 and we are sufficiently reassured that there will be enough funding to satisfy our claimants
328732 the numbers that have been thrown out in the press are not inaccurate it is a very substantial sum of money
328733 i think that if we do this arrangement those matters will go away and we will be able to move ahead in normalizing
328734 this deal would obviously allow a visit by the secretary of state
328735 the administrator robbi ferrell chief of staff of office of enforcement and compliance assurance the branch of the agency charged with making sure environmental laws are followed had turned the epa into a secretive dangerous ally of polluters instead of a leader in the effort to protect the health and safety of the american people

328741 the club used to run its operations and a nursery on a piece of government land in sungai way until the construction of a low cost flats forced them to move out
328742 they then rented a house in ss9 as their operations centre and nursery but there were complaints by residents because of its location and that the quota for underprivileged homes in ss9 had filled up
328743 hence the club is desperate for a new premises and approached me for help

328750 was to get the elderly women and children out first and then come back for the rest
328751 has made a huge difference in the quality of our armed forces and the representational aspects of all our ethnic backgrounds in our military today
328752 integration is a great strength not just for our military but for our nation
328753 we need to keep focusing on integration and keep developing leaders from all backgrounds that individuals can look up to
328754 what we wanted to do and i think something that we were equipped to do was to provide a forum that is really meant to be uplifting to servicemembers
328755 when we went to vegas we thought we ought to get some shows
328756 weve got star trek jersey boys stomp and the chippendales next week is kind of vegas week on moment of thanks
328757 from the very beginning when we started this we reached out to soldiers angels which was incredibly responsive because our mission so clearly meshed with their mission to do anything to support the troops
328758 theyve been helping make introductions to people and helping to spread the word within their organization
328759 were actually beginning to have some soldiers respond back to us
328760 creeping along the edge of the hallway doesnt make us invisible
328761 i know that im endangering my life and am even liable to lose my father but i hope that hell understand this and that god will give him and my family patience and willingness to open their eyes to jesus and to christianity maybe one day ill be able to return to palestine and to ramallah with jesus in the kingdom of god
328762 the alertness you feel is you getting back to normal
328763 we do feel a boost from caffeine in the morning but thats probably due to a reversal of the withdrawal symptoms that alertness you feel is you getting back to normal rather than to an above normal level

328782 the majority of bloggers and internet addicts like the endless rows of talking heads on television do not report

328842 in his conduct while president of the united states george w bush in violation of his constitutional oath to faithfully execute the office of president of the united states and to the best of his ability preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed has committed the following abuses of power
328843 article 1 creating a secret propaganda campaign to manufacture a false case for war against iraq
328844 impeachment may well be the only remedy which remains to stop a war of aggression against iran
328845 there are worrying signs appearing in the united states where some locals are beginning to hoard supplies
328846 were told that the feds bought the entire container of canned butter when it hit the california docks somethings up
328847 we regret to inform you oregon freeze dry cannot satisfy all mountain house 10 can orders and we have removed 10 cans from our website temporarily
328848 the reason for this is sales of 10 cans have continued to increase ofd is allocating as much production capacity as possible to this market segment but we must maintain capacity for our other market segments as well
328849 we want to clarify inaccurate information weve seen on the internet
328850 we expect this situation to be necessary for several months although this isnt a guarantee we will update this information as soon as we know more we apologize for this inconvenience and appreciate your patience we sincerely hope you will continue to be mountain house customers in the future
328851 the government just came in and said theyre buying it they did pay for it
328852 they took it and no one else could have it
328853 we dont know why the feds then went to freeze dried companies and bought most of their canned stock
328854 we are currently out of stock on our cans we are not selling any of our cans
328855 we do sell to the government but it is not the reason for company sales limits
328856 we dont have shelters that are being stocked with food were not doing this for the public my only conclusion is that theyre stocking up for themselves
328857 unprecedented demand cleans out major storable food supplier through 2009
328858 it came to our attention today that the worlds largest producer of storable foods mountain house is currently out of stock of all 10 cans of freeze dried foods not just the turkey tetrazzini they will not have product now through 2009
328859 this information was learned by a mountain house dealer who shared it with me this morning
328860 mountain house claims this situation is due to a backlog of orders which may very well be true but who is purchasing all of their food this is a massive global corporation
328861 one idea the military tensions are ramping up with iran and news segments debate whether or not we will implement a preemptive strike in conjunction with israel
328862 i think that families should be prepared for times of crisis whether its a man made disaster or a natural disaster and i think its wise and prudent to stock up on food
328863 if you get into a situation where fuel supplies are disrupted or even if the power grid were to go down for short periods of time people can work around that
328864 but you cant work around a lack of food people starve people panic and you end up with chaos in the streets
328865 we have more than a three year supply of food here

328911 i knew at once she was looking at no mere statue but that she saw the blessed virgin herself it lasted about five minutes i knew she would be cured
328912 her stare was held fixed a little above the statue and i saw again that look on her face she first displayed as a child all love and adoration when the blessed virgin had healed her it is impossible to describe except to say it was something heavenly

328941 when you consider the fact that he won five super bowls in 22 years that puts him in very rare company in our league
328942 using a different calculator i see eddie as a no brainer
328943 if youre able to remove yourself from the way that the game pulls you in in terms of history he is huge figure in the history of the game
328944 vince lombardi was the image that was projected of nfl head coaches at the time
328945 and i know because i was there i did bill walshs contract for the 49ers
328946 eddie saw beyond that and saw something in bill that was special and frankly im not sure bill could have succeeded in the nfl aside from that environment created by eddie
328947 i think the debartolo walsh partnership had a great deal to do with changing the nfl
328948 the organizational set up of the 49ers greatly influenced the league if bill could think it up eddie would pay for it
328949 eddie is about the best owner you could ever work for he was passionate about his team he was generous to the point that the league had to come up with a lot of rules we went to hawaii for a super bowl ring ceremony and he took everybody players coaches families everybody
328950 eddie was so filled with pride so driven and passionate about building the team into something great
328951 it was really something to me because here he was the son of this real estate magnate his dad basically came up with the idea for strip malls and he was driven to accomplish something himself
328952 i remember when we went to hawaii and eddie brought everybody players families the front office everybody his father was 80 something at the time and had never been off the continental united states but he went to hawaii for that and you could see how much that meant to eddie that his father was so proud of him
328953 if it were the other owners in the league he probably wouldnt get in but its the writers who do the voting so they might now view those transgressions the same way
328954 i dont think that was the easiest moment for them
328955 if you know eddie debartolo it was the ultimate sacrifice for him to lose that team
328956 when he lost the team he lost a portion of his identity that was a hell of a price to pay hopefully as time goes one people can look at him with untinted glasses and understand what he brought to the league
328957 the counsel of the lord stands forever the plans of his heart to all generations

328969 now ill have to clean up this mess and get myself something to drink
328970 why cant that kid understand that i dont want him around
328971 well it has been two minutes and hes not stopping i might as well open the door so i dont have to clean up the mess hell make if he tries coming in the window again
328972 no i well it was just that that pop is warm
328973 look there are no springs around and even if there were they would probably be full of germs i only drink bottled drinks there is nothing wrong with pop i just let that pop sit out too long
328974 he has no right to come and tell me what to do shes my mom and hes a retard there is nothing else i can to but force him to leave before he messes everything up he just doesnt understand
328975 hes sad because i told him he cant go see mom today
328976 those ice cubes are mine there are no more drinks in the fridge and my pop is warm
328977 fine have your ice the water from the tap is cool enough but why are you drinking that anyway mom says that you should drink more water
328978 moms not here and you cant tell me what to do everybody makes such a fuss about eating and drinking natural well what is wrong with the things we men make this stuff is every bit as good as what you have when i get something to drink i dont want to worry that it might be living with who knows what the man made and stored stuff is good enough for me
328979 you know you would be a lot better off if you would just listen to what is good for you but no you think that you know it all
328980 i know what is best for me you have no right to make me do what you think is best

328982 accidental injury and death is the number one killer of children in this nation

328985 the childress institute for pediatric trauma will be the focal point of a national movement to improve the level of pediatric trauma care available across the country we will assemble the right team to conquer this national crisis in pediatric trauma the childress family is committed to making the childress institute the leader in pediatric trauma care
328986 there is no one in the country presently studying this issue in a comprehensive manner as this institute is targeted to become
328987 we wont find a cure for pediatric trauma you are always going to have injuries despite our desire to prevent them and some cant be fixed but for the kids who do get hurt wed like to find a better way to help them and reduce their disability i think we can make the most difference here

329109 be curious to see compelling scientific demonstrations of psi i e a string of multiple successful experiments by several independent investigators producing lawful and replicable outcomes alas i have found none to date
329110 a psi proponent reported a meta analysis of a class of telepathy experiments with an average effect size that significantly differed from zero with odds of more than a trillion to one while another meta analysis concluded that the average effect size was consistent with zero
329111 brain scan tests fail to support validity of esp research on parapsychology is largely taboo in academia but two harvard scientists recently set out to settle once and for all the age old question is extrasensory perception or esp real their sophisticated experiment answers no at least not as far as they can tell using high tech brain scanners to detect neural evidence of it
329112 a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it

329122 clients are looking for a theme party or event that has a change of location throughout the evening we might start things out on a large scale with the entire group being included but as the evening progresses the guests want to have a chance to interact and network with one another we like to add a second element to the evening such as an after glow party some clients even offer a comedy club after an awards banquet to liven things up
329123 there is definitely a movement toward high energy interactive events guests want to be part of the action in some ways they want to be the entertainment food and culture are not enough guests like to do something else while they are attending a function
329124 in the fast paced world of business weve observed that our guests truly enjoy the opportunity to sit down and talk to each other

329136 i dont think you can make it on your own you still need mommy and daddy to make things right for you
329137 at the time officer jaskowski arrived at the park i was already in the process of stopping the music because of complaints from members of the fire department and beer tent staff
329138 the music was at a natural break between bands and i was discussing options for other music for the rest of the night
329139 officer jaskowski arrived and proceeded to attempt to take over
329140 a moment later i heard a strange noise and turned around to see officer jaskowski assaulting the drummer throwing him to the ground and arresting him at no time did i see the drummer make any threatening gestures toward officer jaskowski or attempt to resist arrest
329141 officer jaskowski was standing next to me in the parking lot area when the drumming began he looked up and moved swiftly from the parking area into the park and the gazebo i followed him into the park where i watched him as he grabbed a cymbal and stand and threw it out of the way he then forced himself through the drum kit snatched the drumsticks away from the drummer and tackled the drummer backwards off the stool on the cement where he dragged the drummer onto the grass and began yelling stop resisting stop resisting at no time did the drummer ever take a swing at officer jaslowski and the drummer never showed any signs of attempting to resist the officer
329142 i am asking the village council to place officer jaskowski on leave from his duties and begin the proceedings required to remove him from the office he holds
329143 i was arranging with the announcer to announce that the concert was cancelled at that point the drummer was setting up for the next set as soon as he started playing the drums i turned around and saw the officer running over pushing the fellow against the cymbals into a pole ended up going over the back of the gazebo onto the ground
329144 officer jaskowski looked up and said ive got another set of handcuffs do you want to go to jail too
329145 he jaskowski basically attacked this guy i couldnt believe it was happening it was unreal
329146 there was no announcement nobody told me the concert was off
329147 i thought things could get out of hand very easily
329148 the music if it was music was bellering and pounding it wasnt music for a family group or people that were sitting and having a few drinks and talking i informed him jaskowski that jim and i would shut the beer tent down if the music continued my personal opinion is they beer bent customers were disgusted with it there were people that didnt get out of their cars we just decided it couldnt go on or there would definitely would be problems with that type of crowd mostly underage i got a little leery
329149 are clearly bigoted against those who are different from themselves
329150 the disgrace would be if the village continues to allow people such as mr willis and officer jaskowski to be in such dominant leadership positions
329151 it obviously involves our employees and thats something were careful to make sure things are done right
329152 im not saying theres an investigation but were concerned about the letters and issues at hand the night of the festival there are always two sides to every story as you very well know
329153 im trying to be good so karma wont get me
329154 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
329155 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
329156 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
329157 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
329158 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
329159 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
329160 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
329161 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
329162 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
329163 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
329164 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
329165 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
329166 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

329176 no no of course i have there is no doubt that the extraordinary work of our u s forces has contributed to a lessening of the violence so this in no way detracts from the great efforts of our young men and women in uniform in fact thats one of the most striking things about visiting iraq is to see how dedicated they are what a great job they do

329205 we knew we didnt want to offer another luau but when we visited kilohana we liked the new luau pavilion that fred atkins has built our team discussed options and we came up with a great concept we created a retro hawaii theme so we can include the look and feel of kilohana and kauai but with a different twist from there well throw in the extra touches and creative details to make it fresh and exciting

329218 the right to vote is one of the most vital and inalienable rights in our great nation for our armed forces however carrying out that right is too often marred in bureaucratic hurdles and complications blunt said the fact that less than 17 percent of the 6 million citizens serving our nation overseas eligible to vote participated in the 2006 election demonstrates the overwhelming need to address this problem that is why i have introduced this resolution today to urge the department of defense to take every step to educate our armed forces about participating in this years historic election

329281 is a trademark of iraqi leader saddam husseins biological weapons program
329282 only one country iraq has used bentonite to produce biological weapons
329283 there is purely circumstantial though highly suggestive evidence that might seem to link iraq with last falls anthrax terrorism
329284 detected an apparent anthrax leak in december 2001 at the height of the anthrax mailings investigation but did not report it
329285 the political and journalistic establishment suddenly seems united in wanting to attack iraq
329286 now that we know that the us govt believes that anthrax came from the inside shouldnt cohen be a wee bit curious about what this warning was based on
329287 theres either a significant amount of money behind this or this is state sponsored or this is stuff that was stolen from the former soviet program
329288 if the now deceased ivins really was the culprit behind the attacks then that means that the anthrax came from a u s government lab

329292 hell otherwise known as congress has officially frozen over for the first time since the 1950s members will skip town today for the august recess without either chamber having passed a single appropriations bill then again democrats appear ready to sacrifice their whole agenda even spending rather than allow new domestic energy production
329293 or even a mere debate about energy the democratic leadership is stonewalling any measure that might possibly relax the congressional ban on offshore drilling nancy pelosi and harry reid know that they would lose if a vote ever came to the floor and theyre desperate to suppress an insurrection among those democrats who are pragmatic about one of the top economic issues behind this whatever it takes obstructionism is an ideological commitment to high energy prices the rulers of the democratic party want prices to keep rising

329306 a couple of years ago we had a look at several gaming and illuminated desktop peripherals from revoltec including the first version of lightmouse as well as the fightboard and the fightmouse of their gaming series revoltec have expanded their gaming series with the fightpad advanced which is a mini keyboard designed for fps games and released three new versions of the lightmouse
329307 there have been lots and lots of keyboards over the years and most of the fancier ones try to enhance usability or implement some new feature that we cant live without most of the time designers guess wrong and implement a useless set of features or take away things we have finally become used to as of today there is no one keyboard that can please everyone which makes it difficult for the pc enthusiast who listens to music does office work or programming and gaming

329311 it is a very transitional type of business chains come and go businesses come and go what weve done is try to spread out retail complexes and still focus on the downtown
329312 it bucks the trend because those centers in many communities have been left vacant or have been torn down
329313 that center was not built correctly there has been a part of that center that has never been occupied and thats because retailers want exposure to the main street its not good for retailers if they cant be seen
329314 inland u s management is exploring a number of options to improve massillon commons from re tenanting to diversifying the tenant mix to possibly redeveloping the center to allow for an expanded range of tenant spaces
329315 there might be a need for a remake of that center for it to be successful
329316 they need to tear down a portion of that building that angles back and rebuild the eastern portion of that center
329317 its night and day just look at what happens when you take an existing building and put a whole new front on it

329319 if you look at the big boxes which make decisions based on demographic studies they set the trends

329321 it was one of the original buildings the hospital operated in 1898

329323 it had a lot of wood in the ceiling it had a lot of wood beams there was a lot of marble in it
329324 when that was made into a protestant chapel there were a lot of donations from the community from area churches that went into that
329325 they made an appeal to the community and a lot of the surrounding churches made donations to renovate it
329326 there were many many patients who enjoyed the protestant services and the catholic services
329327 the services were well attended and many patients looked forward to going there
329328 it would have taken a lot of money to fix up they were beautiful buildings and i always thought the chapel was a beautiful historic landmark
329329 we were in the process of working with a local developer to get a letter of intent to take to council to redevelop this area
329330 the people who are here are top notch people who want to move the district forward
329331 it is not my job as an interim superintendent to initiate and affect changes
329332 i plan on taking it one at a time i want to examine each issue and figure out the root causes
329333 but we have to maintain a can do attitude we have to believe that we can solve these issues and that we can move forward
329334 positive people affect positive changes and a positive person can be infectious
329335 negativity breeds only negativity and negativity just brings you down
329336 my goals are to get to know the district and the people in the district
329337 every school district has a fingerprint and it is my job to interpret that fingerprint and find a good fit for the schools

329341 all of the things you check in the case of an accidental fire are not here
329342 theres no other evidence of any other cause there is no accidental reason why this would happen we know weve had vagrants in the area stripping copper from it and the police have had reports of trespassers
329343 the first truck at the scene found the building to be fully involved
329344 our biggest problem was water supply and trying to keep the fire out of the other two buildings once we established a water supply we were able to focus on the chapel
329345 when we arrived at the scene i didnt think we were going to be able to protect those two buildings

329374 i propose a peace plan that will avert war and bring peace to the middle east
329375 first the president and hillary must stop playing politics with peace they are using the peace process to solidify the jewish vote this is not in americas interest america must remain neutral america must put united states not israeli interests first last and always
329376 first we must recognize that we have a conflict with two horrible historic victims
329377 the people of israel were victimized by the crimes of the third reich
329378 second the united states must stop pretending that israel is negotiating to give the palestinians a state
329379 third extremist israeli politicians must stop preaching theology to a secular world god did not create the state of israel it was created by the united nations israel itself is a creation of international law
329380 fourth the united states must stop playing politics with jerusalem
329381 my peace plan calls on the united states to create the state of palestine by announcing promptly that on september 13 2000 the united states will formally recognize the state of palestine as encompassing all the land of united nations resolution 242 and the west bank
329382 resolution 242 is international law neither israel nor the united states can pretend that international law does not exist or seek to negotiate an extortion of land from people who are protected by resolution 242
329383 recently the new york times carried a harrowing story of how israel is committing mini genocide against the palestinian people by denying them water it is tragic that a state that was created in response to the darkest horrors of humanity should stoop to these vile tactics
329384 i know many jewish people will think i am making extreme suggestions i am not if my plan is not implemented here is what will happen
329385 first there will be a brief war in the middle east israel will react unlawfully as it has threatened to do defy international law and annex land that does not belong to it these acts will be nullified by the united nations israel will be branded an outlaw state
329386 second based on my information and sources if israel defies international law and annexes any part of the land covered by resolution 242 the european union will step to the fore and impose an embargo on israel
329387 if the president does not stop posturing and do the right thing he may not only precipitate a war
329388 the twentieth century saw the deepest darkest days of humanity in the third reich we must not begin the new millennium with a breakdown of international law
329389 i wish the people of israel peace i wish the people of palestine peace and i wish for the united states to bring peace not war to the middle east

329393 ramos looks like a good rival for wenger in that he is calm talented and devoted to fitness and discipline
329394 he has a real granite face and is not the kind of coach youd like to upset i like that
329395 if i were ramos this season id be making noises in public about needing time to gel and how this is my first full season privately though id definitely be telling the spurs players they are what they are world class players
329396 id be convincing them there is no reason not to target arsenal they must be ready and push for fourth place if the gunners slip up
329397 its a massive ask and fifth would be a good achievement for tottenham but they must be ambitious in light of the talent theyve bought
329398 ive enormous admiration for the football wenger produces but he is happy to stick with the kids this year
329399 im concerned you cant keep developing a new side each season at the very top level you need a settled consistent experienced side
329400 perhaps there are still some financial restrictions and arsene is expected to keep on pulling rabbits out of that hat every season with cheaper unknown young talents its very very hard to do year after year

329432 if you are looking for interventions to prevent alzheimers one way may be to identify people who have been divorced or widowed and who havent adapted or gotten back into the social circle and give them support with the aim of giving them new structure and social networks in their lives
329433 if any club tried to do that wed stop them from doing it
329434 there were a lot of teams we knew were talking about doing this or doing that but we werent going to make manny a postcard
329435 we told the red sox to examine all of their options and let us know what they came up with

329443 we hope families will choose the missouri state fair as part of their vacation plans this summer
329444 were as gloomy as the sky im looking at right now
329445 i think what we offer to those chicago people which they dont have is livestock and opportunities to come down and be with the rest of the state
329446 obviously a trip to the fair would just add expenses
329447 then you compound that with a couple of family members you know going with their children
329448 if well have a hundred plus people going we think thats pretty good
329449 if we can get weather about 80 82 thatll draw people
329450 you get weather up around 90 95 that hurts the crowds

329453 mamn what were you doing at the wakonda country club
329454 i was attempting to make a citizens arrest of karl rove your honor
329455 somebody told me that there were redheaded woodpeckers up here so i came walked five minutes and there was a redheaded woodpecker
329456 and it flew into a hole in a tree and i said wow this is easy
329457 the young make a lot of chattering so you can usually tell where the nest is
329458 theres a redheaded and hes got a baby with him
329459 see these two trees to the left go to the right most one it forks and theres a broken off snag up there looks like a y thats where the babies were sticking their head out a couple weeks ago it was really cute
329460 were going to measure the diameter of the tree how high the nest cavity is the species of the tree is it alive or is it dead so we can get some data on what seems to be the preferred habitat
329461 if our theory see this is all theory if our theory is correct the golf course replicates an oak savannah and there should be birds there
329462 the woodpecker is called a primary nester it digs the cavity but flying squirrels mice snakes bluebirds tree swallows there are lots of other animals that are secondary nesters
329463 they cant drill the hole but they live there so what were trying to do is preserve the habitat so the woodpeckers drill the hole and when they leave something else will come in and live in it
329464 the way to be a master of rps is to declare yourself as one and then act like one
329465 he was taken into custody at orlando international airport this afternoon while he was trying to board a flight to houston texas

329518 some of the episodes i actually dont read until i get on the day just so i can see what crazy thing shes going to do to me that day
329519 is simply this what does a science fiction writer know about on what
329520 in 1951 when i sold my first story i had no idea that such fundamental issues could be pursued in the science fiction field i began to pursue them unconsciously my first story had to do with a dog who imagined that the garbagemen who came every friday morning were stealing valuable food which the family had carefully stored away in a safe metal container every day members of the family carried out paper sacks of nice ripe food stuffed them into the metal container shut the lid tightly and when the container was full these dreadful looking creatures came and stole everything but the can finally in the story the dog begins to imagine that someday the garbagemen will eat the people in the house as well as stealing their food of course the dog is wrong about this we all know that garbagemen do not eat people but the dogs extrapolation was in a sense logical given the facts at his disposal the story was about a real dog and i used to watch him and try to get inside his head and imagine how he saw the world
329521 i decided that dog sees the world quite differently than i do or any humans do and then i began to think maybe each human being lives in a unique world a private world a world different from those inhabited and experienced by all other humans and that led me wonder if reality differs from person to person can we speak of reality singular or shouldnt we really be talking about plural realities and if there are plural realities are some more true more real than others what about the world of a schizophrenic
329522 reality is that which when you stop believing in it doesnt go away
329523 sometimes when i watch my eleven year old daughter watch tv i wonder what she is being taught the problem of miscuing consider that a tv program produced for adults is viewed by a small child half of what is said and done in the tv drama is probably misunderstood by the child maybe its all misunderstood and the thing is just how authentic is the information anyhow even if the child correctly understood it what is the relationship between the average tv situation comedy to reality what about the cop shows cars are continually swerving out of control crashing and catching fire the police are always good and they always win do not ignore that point the police always win what a lesson that is you should not fight authority and even if you do you will lose the message here is be passive
329524 so i ask in my writing what is real because unceasingly we are bombarded with pseudo realities manufactured by very sophisticated people using very sophisticated electronic mechanisms i do not distrust their motives i distrust their power they have a lot of it and it is an astonishing power that of creating whole universes universes of the mind i ought to know i do the same thing it is my job to create universes as the basis of one novel after another and i have to build them in such a way that they do not fall apart two days later
329525 however i will reveal a secret to you i like to build universes which
329526 because the bombardment of pseudo realities begins to produce inauthentic humans very quickly spurious humans as fake as the data pressing at them from all sides
329527 the basic tool for the manipulation of reality is the manipulation of words if you can control the meaning of words you can control the people who must use the words george orwell made this clear in his novel 1984 but another way to control the minds of people is to control their perceptions if you can get them to see the world as you do they will think as you do comprehension follows perception how do you get them to see the reality you see after all it is only one reality out of many images are a basic constituent pictures this is why the power of tv to influence young minds is so staggeringly vast and and i say this as a professional fiction writer the producers scriptwriters and directors who create these video audio worlds do not know how much of their content is true in other words they are victims of their own product along with us speaking for myself i do not know how much of my writing is true or which parts if any are true this is a potentially lethal situation we have fiction mimicking truth and truth mimicking fiction we have a dangerous overlap a dangerous blur and in all probability it is not deliberate in fact that is part of the problem you cannot legislate an author into correctly labelling his product like a can of pudding whose ingredients are listed on the label you cannot compel him to declare what part is true and what isnt if he himself does not know it is an eerie experience to write something into a novel believing it is pure fiction and to learn later on perhaps years later that it is true
329528 lets just cut the crap here gt gt dicks cool and all but the just gt gt thought too much and its starting gt gt to get really weird
329529 the authentic human being is one of us who instinctively knows what he should not do and in addition he will balk at doing it will refuse to do it even if this brings down dread consequences to him and to those whom he loves this to me is the ultimately heroic trait of ordinary people they say no to the tyrant and they calmly take the consequences of this resistance their deeds may be small and almost always unnoticed unmarked by history
329530 i see their authenticity in an odd way not in their willingness to perform great heroic deeds but in their quiet refusals

329536 years of backing an anti soviet jihad has left its mark there are probably still individuals within the isi who are ideologically sympathetic to the taliban and act on their own in ways that are not in convergence with the policies and interests of the government we need to identify these people and weed them out
329537 there is no question of any purge in the isi the government has already stated that there are no links or evidence of isi involvement in the kabul bombing it was in the past during the afghan jihad against soviet forces that a few pro taliban elements had found their way in and with the change in policy have been firmly rooted out

329725 in his current condition the stoner exhibits an inability to communicate effectively
329726 in fact we have learned through our intensive research that both male and female stoners tend to lack the motivation to maintain proper hygiene

329728 a tragic species they are an endangerment to themselves and to the public in general
329729 what has more cancer causing chemicals marijuana smoke or cigarette smoke
329730 lena definitely has good instincts she has this inner knowledge or awareness that keeps her focused properly on whats right and wrong her problem is shes too timid with her life too fearful to step forward and make a decision when it needs to be done she needs that little push but her friends are not always there to give it to her
329731 to tell you the truth with doing tvs gilmore girls for so many years i dont think ive ever had the time to run around and get into trouble besides im a pretty low key person anyway
329732 it was great were all friends so it was really easy to pick up where we left off
329733 part 1 wasnt necessarily big at the box office but the dvd was huge in part 2 we the four girls who share a friendship and those extraordinary pants are all a little older and were off to college and new challenges
329734 i never was particularly athletic but now that i have a personal trainer finally i have muscles

329740 using reliable trouble free equipment is mandatory for a safe successful and enjoyable night fishing experience
329741 we still prefer to use natural bait they seem to produce best for us catfish love baits like worms chicken livers and fresh cut bait ask others who fish in your area what baits are working for them it is important to select the right bait for the fish you are after channel catfish and blue catfish are scavengers and will hit just about any bait flatheads on the other hand are predators meaning they prefer to hit live baits many people think flatheads are scavengers but that assumption is wrong
329742 i think after the first time we felt a real compulsion to come back
329743 we know theres a lot of work that is still not finished here

329762 obama gets butt assed naked when he makes love to his wife not stick his penis through his dickhole he cant lead
329763 obama is presumptious and not humble even though the people dont want an unsure doucebag
329764 but what is of great concern to british indians is that
329765 first a percussion bomb exploded and then a bomb in a garbage container exploded
329766 i condemn those who carried out this bombing which shows us terrorisms inhumane desire for cruelty and violence without discriminating between men and women young old and children
329767 allah willing i will get the chance to kill more israelis
329768 youre not going to work here if you dont remove
329769 we tried to go to the police but the villagers forced us to stay indoors and threatened us with the same fate if we go to the police
329770 send regards to israel i miss it i respect israel and admire it as a country
329771 we have a lot of potential but not the chance to show it
329772 it shouldnt happen i mean i think were in america youre in america i think that they should go with our holidays
329773 the ban was based on the prophets peace be upon him saying that its forbidden to give or accept any money related to the selling or buying of dogs

329789 we need to protect consumers access said fcc chairman kevin martin a republican
329790 while comcast has said it would stop the arbitrary blocking consumers deserve to know that the commitment is backed up by legal enforcement
329791 congress has intentionally refrained from imposing the heavy hand of government which is precisely why we have seen such rapid growth in the internet
329792 the fccs bipartisan decision to punish comcast is a major victory defying every ounce of conventional wisdom in washington everyday people have taken on a major corporation and won an historic precedent for an open internet
329793 comcasts history of deception and continued blocking show contempt for the online consumer protections established by the fcc
329794 todays order makes it clear that there is nothing reasonable about restricting access to online content or technologies moving forward this bellwether case will send a strong signal to cable and phone companies that such violations will not be tolerated
329795 but the fight is far from over a duopoly market where phone and cable companies control nearly 99 percent of high speed connections will not discipline itself we look forward to working with the fcc and congress to ensure proactive measures keep the internet open and free of discrimination and accessible to all americans

329800 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck rick davis mr
329801 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me mr
329802 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
329803 hes not from central casting when it comes to candidates for president of the united states hes new to washington yes hes african american
329804 they were concerned to a person they dont want to see mark begich as the united states senator representing alaska
329805 even in texas one of the reddest states in the country people are fed up
329806 combine this desire for change with the strong campaigns both michael skelly and larry joe doherty are running and it offers democrats unique opportunities in texas this year
329807 while middle class families fight to hold on to jobs health care and their homes in a struggling economy sen schuring is talking about cutting corporate taxes for the oil companies and executives who are funding his campaign
329808 the last seven years have shown what happens when politicians put special interests ahead of americas interests now its time to create jobs and cut taxes for the families who need it the most

329816 biarpun aku mesti membunuh siang toako tak dapat aku mengawasi penderitaannya dengan berpeluk tangan
329817 selama beberapa hari siauwtee telah mempelajari kitab kitab ouw sinshe dan biarpun belum mengerti benar tapi karena keadaan memaksa siauwtee ingin coba menggunakan jarum untuk mengobati toako andaikata terjadi kejadian yang tidak di harapkan siauwteepun tidak bisa hidup sendirian dalam dunia ini
329818 lekas gunakan jarum itu kalau kau berhasil soe peh akan merasa malu sekali andaikata aku mati aku memang lebih suka mati daripada berendam di genangan ini
329819 begini saja satu jiwa ditukar dengan satu jiwa tolonglah siang toako sesudah kau menolong aku akan segera binasa dihadapanmu
329820 aku hanya kian sie poet kioe ouw ceng goe aku bukan boe siang setan yang biasa membetot jiwa orang kalau kau mampus sedikitpun tiada sangkut pautnya dengan aku andaikata sepuluh boe kie mati akupun tidak akan menolong satu siang gie coen
329821 boleh masaklah obat menurut timbangannya kalau dia tidak mati benar benar rejekinya besar
329822 siang toako minumlah obat ini apa untung apa celaka siauwtee sendiri tak tahu
329823 obatmu teryata tidak membinasakan manusia aku merasa badanku banyak lebih enak lebih nyaman
329824 hanya obatmu mungkin terlalu keras perutku seperti diiris iris pisau
329825 tiga bulan kemudian aku akan kembali untuk menengokmu kalau racun dingin sudah diusir bersih dari badanmu aku akan segera mengantarkan kau pulang ke boe tong
329826 sekarang teecoe sudah sembuh sama sekali biarpun benar saudara thio yang mengobati akan tetapi pengobatan itu diberikan berdasarkan petunjuk kitab kitab ouw soepeh di samping itu teecoe juga telah menghabiskan banyak sekali obat obatan soepeh yang berharga mahal untuk itu semua teecoe hanya bisa menghaturkan banyak banyak terima kasih
329827 lukamu memang sudah sembuh hanya sayang usiamu berkurang dengan tiga puluh tahun
329828 dilihat dari kekuatan badanmu paling sedikit kau bisa hidup sampai usia delapanpuluh tahun
329829 tapi karena bocah itu membuat kesalahan dalam memberi obat dan membuat kesalahan pula waktu menusuk jalanan darahmu maka setiap kali bertemu delapan musim hujan angin sekujur badanmu akan dirasakan sakit menurut taksiranku kau hanya bisa berusia sampai lima puluh tahun
329830 jika seorang laki laki bisa menolong sesama manusia dan mengabdi kepada negara berusia sampai empat puluh tahun saja kurasa sudah cukup jika seorang hidup tanpa tujuan maka biarpun ia bisa berumur seratus tahun hidupnya percuma saja
329831 ilmu silat thay soehoemu sangat tinggi tapi dalam ilmu ketabiban ia mencelakakan kau sesudah kau kena pukulan hian beng sin ciang ia membuka kie keng pat mehmu betul betul gila
329832 boe kie pendeta siauw lim itu pasti dengan sengaja mencelakakan kau
329833 aku belum pernah mengenalnya ada perlu apa dia harus mencelakakan aku
329834 coba kau ceritakan terlebih jelas semua pengalamanmu di siauw sit san
329835 tidak bisa salah lagi pendeta itu memang sengaja mencelakakan kau thay soehoemu tidak mengerti ilmu ketabiban dan juga ia adalah seorang yang sangat percaya segala manusia maka itu ia tidak bercuriga coba kau pikir goan tin adalah seorang yang mahir dalam ilmu siauw lim kioe yang kang dan ia juga bisa membantu kau dalam membuka kie keng pat mehmu dengan lain perkataan ia sudah memiliki lweekang sangat tinggi maka itu begitu lekas kedua telapak tangannya menempel dengan telapak tanganmu ia pasti tahu bahwa dalam tubuhmu mengeram racun dingin tapi ia malah sengaja membuka pembuluh darahmu apakah dengan begitu ia bukan sengaja mencelakakan kau
329836 tapi dari sebelum menobloskan tembok ia memang sudah berniat untuk bantu membuka kie keng pat mehku
329837 waktu ia belum tahu bahwa aku kena pukulan hian beng sin ciang
329838 sebab apa goan tin mau mencelakakan kau aku masih belum tahu
329839 kau mengatakan bahwa sebab belum pernah kenal satu sama lain maka tak mungkin ia mencelakakan kau akan tetapi kau harus ingat bahwa kau sudah belajar siauw lim kioe yang kang yang mungkin dianggap olehnya sebagai miliknya sendiri hal ini sudah cukup untuk menimbulkan niatan membunuh kau di dalam hatinya
329840 menurut katanya thay soehoe siauw lim sie dan boe tong adalah pemimpin dari partai partai yang lurus bersih
329841 menurut pendapatku biarpun dalam kuil siauw lim sie terdapat orang orang yang berpemandangan sempit akan tetapi mereka pasti tidak akan bertindak secara begitu hina dina apa pula thay soehoe sendiri telah menyerahkan thay kek sip sam sit dan boe tong kioe yang kang kepada mereka sebagai penukaran dalam hal ini pada hakekatnya pihak siauw lim yang lebih untung
329842 apakah ayah dan ibumu bukan didesak sehingga binasa oleh orang orang dari partai lurus bersih dengan menganggap bahwa mereka putih bersih mereka berlaku sangat kejam terhadap orang orang dari partai yang dianggapnya sesat padahal orang orang partai lurus bersih belum tentu baik semuanya sedang orang orang dari partai sesat belum tentu jahat seanteronya
329843 baru menemui satu soal saja kau sudah menangis jika kau tidak mati hari ini di hari kemudian kau bakal mengalami banyak sekali kejadian kejadian yang dapat mengucurkan air matamu
329844 kau mengatakan bahwa kau belum pernah melihat muka goan tin
329845 tapi bagimana kau tahu bahwa dia tidak mengenal kau suara orang dapat diubah bahkan muka masih bisa diubah dia tidak mau menemui kau hal ini saja sudah menerbitkan kecurigaan kau mengatakan bahwa tanpa sebab seseorang pasti takkan mencelakakan kau apa kau tahu pasti bahwa aku tidak ingin membunuh kau biarlah aku berterus terang karena melihat penyakitmu sangat aneh maka aku sudah mau berusaha untuk mengobati kau tapi berbareng dengan itu akupun telah mengambil keputusan bahwa begitu lekas kau sembuh aku akan segera mengambil jiwamu
329846 racun dingin dalam tubuhku tak dapat diusir keluar lagi seanteronya tanpa kau turun tangan aku akau mati sendiri hai manusia di dunia agaknya merasa senang jika melihat orang lain celaka atau mati bukankah orang yang belajar silat bertujuan untuk membunuh sesama manusia
329847 di waktu masih muda aku mempelajari ilmu ketabiban dengan tekad untuk menolong sesama manusia akan tetapi orang orang yang ditolong berbalik mencelakakan aku aku pernah menolong jiwa seorang yang mendapat tujuhbelas lubang luka bacokan dia sebenarnya sudah mesti mati tiga hari tiga malam aku tidak tidur dan dengan seantero kepandaian aku berhasil menyembuhkannya belakangan aku mengangkat saudara dengannya tak dinyana ia akhimya membinasakan adik perempuanku adik kandungku siapa dia dia sekarang seorang tokoh besar yang namanya besar pula dari sebuah partai lurus bersih
329848 kalau begitu ia mendapat gelaran kian sie poet kioe karena ia telah mengalami kejadian hebat
329849 siapa adanya manusia binatang itu mengapa kau tidak cari padanya untuk membalas sakit hati
329850 pada waktu mau meninggal dunia adikku telah memaksa aku bersumpah bahwa aku tak akan coba membalas sakit hati
329851 lebih gila lagi ia minta aku berjanji bahwa kalau manusia itu berada dalam bahaya aku mesti menolong dapat dimengerti jika aku menolak tuntutan itu tapi sebelum aku meluluskan adikku tidak akan mati dengan mata meram hati adikku hatinya terlalu mulia akhirnya aku tak dapat tidak meluluskan permintaannya yang paling penghabisan itu
329852 ingatlah apa yang dikatakan olehku tak boleh kau menyebut nyebut lagi di hadapanku jika kau membocorkan pembicaraan ini kepada orang lain aku akan membuat kau hidup tidak matipun tidak
329853 baiklah aku berjanji tak akan bicara lagi mengenai hal itu
329854 dengan kecerdasanmu dibantu olehku sendiri sebelum berusia dua belas tahun kau sudah akan hisa merendengi hoa to atau pian ciak hanya sayang sungguh sayang
329855 dalam beberapa hari ini seorang musuh yang sangat lihai akan menyatroni ouw soepeh sebenarnya aku ingin mengajak kau pergi ke lain tempat untuk sementara waktu akan tetapi ouw soepeh mengatakan bahwa musuh itu tak akan bisa berbuat banyak ia mengatakan aku tak usah takut tapi aku harap kau suka berlaku hati hati
329856 aku mendengar warta itu di tengah jalan dan buru buru aku datang kemari untuk memberitahukan ouw soepeh saudara ouw soepeh seorang pintar yang sangat berhati hati kalau ia mengatakan tak usah kuatir ia tentu sudah mempunyai pegangan hanya aku yang masih berkuatir
329857 baru saja aku membawa teh ouw sinshe memesan supaya ia tidak diganggu
329858 hari ini badanku kurang enak leherku sakit kau belajar saja sendiri
329859 aku sendiri sudah memeriksa dari tadi tak apa apa aku sendiri sudah minum obat
329860 mungkin sekali biarpun berhasil mengusirnya ouw sinshe sendiri terluka berat
329861 kau dan si kacung tidak boleh masuk lagi ke dalam kamarku
329862 semua perabot makan sesudah digunakan olehku harus diseduh dengan air panas
329863 boe kie begini saja menyingkirlah dari ouw tiap kok untuk sementara waktu kau boleh menumpang di salah sebuah rumah penduduk kira kira setengah bulan aku kuatir kau ketularan cacar
329864 sinshe sedang sakit kalau aku pergi siapa yang harus merawatmu biar bagaimanapun jua aku lebih mengenal ilmu pengobatan dari pada kedua kacung itu
329865 baiklah tapi biar bagaimanapun jua aku melarang kau masuk lagi ke kamarku
329866 maka itulah seorang pandai tidak mengobati penyakit tapi menjaga supaya penyakit itu jangan sampai timbul ia tidak membereskan kekacauan tapi menjaga jangan sampai kekacauan muncul inilah jalan yang paling baik kalau menunggu sampai penyakit timbul dan baru mengobatinya sampai kekacauan muncul dan baru mengobatinya sampai kekacauan muncul dan baru membereskannya maka usaha itu adalah seperti menggali sumur sesudah haus atau membuat senjata sesudah menghadapi musuh apakah itu bukan sudah terlambat
329867 memang sudah terlambat kalau menggali sumur sesudah haus dan membuat senjata sesudah berhadapan dengan musuh
329868 membereskan negara sesudah terbit kekacauan juga sudah terlambat biarpun andaikata keamanan dapat dipulihkan akan tetapi negara tetap mendapat kerugian mengobati penyakit juga tiada bedanya lebih baik menjaga sebelum penyakit mengamuk dari pada mengobati sesudah penyakit itu menjadi berat
329869 seorang tabib yang pandai paling senang mengobati kulit dan bulu kemudian mengobati otot otot lalu mengobati urat urat dan akhirnya baru mengobati isi perut jika ia harus mengobati isi perut maka kemungkinan sembuhnya si sakit hanya separuh separuh
329870 seorang tabib pandai selalu mengobati pada waktu penyakit baru saja muncul kalau penyakit sudab masuk ke isi perut biar bagaimana pandaipun jua ia tidak mempunyai pegangan lagi seperti aku racun sudah masuk ke dalam isi perutku keadaanku sudah sembilan bagian mati dan hanya satu bagian hidup
329871 kudengar suara tindakan bebrapa ekor kuda yang masuk ke selat ini bagaimana baiknya
329872 sesama orang rimba persilatan mohon bertemu dengan ie sian ouw sinshe

329881 di luar menunggu tiga orang yang mendapat luka berat dan minta pertolonganmu mereka mengatakan bahwa mereka adalah murid murid dari sian ie ciang boen hoa san pay
329882 ouw sinshe tak bisa menemui kalian karena penyakitnya masih belum mendingan
329883 saudara bawalah bunga emas itu kepada kian sie poet kioe
329884 beritahukanlah bahwa kami bertiga telah dilukakan oleh majikan dari bunga emas itu dia akan segera mencari le sian sendiri jika kian sie poet kioe suka mengobati kami sesudah sembuh kami akan tetap berdiam di sini untuk bantu melawan musuh biarpun kepandaian kami tidak berarti tapi masih merupakan tiga tenaga bantuan
329885 orang kurus itu memiliki kepandaian yang cukup tinggi tapi dia masih kena dilukakan oleh majikan bunga emas itu
329886 siang toako mengatakan bahwa seorang musuh akan menyatroni ouw sinshe mungkin sekali musuh ouw sinshe adalah orang itu
329887 taruh bunga emas itu di atas meja dan lekas keluar
329888 ouw sinshe kena penyakit cacar karena dirinya sendiri belum tentu dapat ditolong ia jadinya tidak dapat mengobati kalian tuan tuan maka itu silahkan tuan tuan sekalian lekas mencari tabib lain saja supaya kamu tidak dimatikan oleh luka luka kau
329889 saudara nio mukamu lebih terang mungkin kau dapat mengundang ouw sinsbe
329890 tolong kau menyampaikan kepada ouw sinshe bahwa aku si orang she nio dari toko emas goan sang di boe hoe telah datang dari tempat yang jauh memohon berobat
329891 saudara kecil kau she apa apakah hubungan sama ouw sinshe
329892 sudah dua tahun lebih ouw sinshe mengobati aku aku masih belum sembuh betul ouw sinshe telah membilang dia tidak dapat mengobati maka itu sudah pasti dia tidak bakal mengobatinya karenanya tidak ada gunanya untuk kamu berdiam lama lama disini
329893 lembah ouw tiap kok ini sepi luar biasa kecuali orang orang partai agama sesat orang kang ouw juga sedikit yang sekali mengetahuinya maka itu mereka ini ialah orang orang khong tong pay dan lainnya yang bukan kaum sesat kenapa mereka berbareng pada datang kemari untuk berobat pula kenapa mereka juga terluka berbareng dan itu pemilik bunga emas dia lihai sekali untuknya jikalau dia mau mengambil jiwa mereka ini itulah bukan pekerjaan sulit kenapa dia justeru melukai orang orang ini hebat begini macam
329894 aku telah dapat mempelajari ilmu tabib dari ouw sinshe maka itu akupun boleh mempelajari ilmunya melihat kematian tidak menolong
329895 ibu di sana ada sinar api di dalam rumah kita sudah sampai

329970 theres a lot of people out there that seem to be displeased with it but were pretty happy with the contribution that he makes
329971 maybe there might be an opportunity for the media to focus on the guys that cant get the footy rather than the guy that can get the footy and then focus on the goal kicking
329972 the way that we look at it he is a very very dangerous forward and what its doing is opposition sides are starting to double team him and thats going to create opportunities for other forwards in the side

329990 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
