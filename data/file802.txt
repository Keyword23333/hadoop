8020226 we all have a stereotypical image that it folks dont tend to be good leaders but it turns out they are more satisfied with their leadership skills than people in marketing finance and customer service by a fairly significant margin

8020386 no different than holding a pistol to a persons head and firing a blank
8020387 are you telling me you dont like the name billings or that you dont like having eric as a father
8020388 billings is ok i guess and daddys fine its just that i feel like the rugs been pulled out from under me suddenly daddys not daddy anymore and someone named lawrence james lightman someone ive never met before is my real father
8020389 laurie lets get one thing straight right now theres a lot more to being someones real father than simply getting their mother pregnant
8020390 but my father never had a chance to do those things with me
8020391 because eric had to have his permission to adopt you after the divorce and because jim didnt care enough about his parental rights to show up in court at the adoption hearing thats how i know that and the fact that in all your fifteen years hes never so much as written one word to find out how you were
8020392 forgive me sweetheart i shouldnt say things like that frankly im surprised thinking about that man can still make me this angry it was all so long ago
8020393 there is something i want you to think about though laurie i dont think it came as a surprise to god that meg married jim lightman nor was it a shock to him that the marriage only lasted a year i think he planned it that way
8020394 but that doesnt mean he doesnt use it for his purposes on occasion
8020395 sometimes i embroider and i start thinking how marvelous and strange and wonderfully complicated life is see this
8020396 it doesnt seem to have anything at all to do with the picture on the front does it
8020397 i always wondered how you could get the back to look like that though mine always looks like a mess with knots and ends of threads everywhere
8020398 no its not hard at all you just have to follow a pattern when you stitch instead of just going any which way you please
8020399 i used to think there wasnt any pattern in my life or anyone elses for that matter especially when things werent going the way i thought they should life looked like the back of one of your pieces of needlepoint no rhyme nor reason to any of it and ugly parts of life are ugly when all you can see are the parts i felt like that when meg ran off and married jim lightman
8020400 there was just something about him i didnt trust and alan didnt like him either
8020401 well then you know where your looks come from youve got megs eyes and and her nose but everything else is pure lightman
8020402 i think ill put this up until tomorrow my eyes arent what they used to be
8020403 because god wanted you to have eric billings as a father
8020404 well to us then and to you now the whole situation looked like that mess
8020405 it wasnt that he didnt want you he just didnt want the responsibility of being anyones father he didnt want any baby in his life then and he made that quite clear to your mother he made her life miserable after that finally she had no choice but to leave him
8020406 youll have to find out the details from your mother
8020407 mumps after that jim lightman couldnt father any more children youre his only offspring
8020408 no im saying god made sure you were conceived before your father got mumps its a matter of timing one month later and there would have been no laurie lightman to become laurie billings i think god really wanted
8020409 think about it a moment laurie think about all the people over all the intervening years who had to come together at just the right time for there to be a laurie billings if i hadnt married your grandfather for instance i wouldnt have had your mother and you wouldnt be here some other little girl perhaps but not you
8020410 so you think god cares whether or not i was born instead of that other little girl
8020411 if he is well what about kids who are born to parents that abuse them or who starve to death in some foreign country because of a famine or something is god responsible for them too is that what he had in mind for them
8020412 laurie im no theologian but i do know the bible say that god is involved wtih each child even in the womb and that children are a reward and that the number of days alloted to each person is written down set even before they have lived one so yes i believe god is intimately involved in each persons life
8020413 i have a theory about why some children have such a hard time in life while others dont want to hear it
8020414 its my box theory see i think gods resons for being born are much different from what people think they should be if you or i were in charge wed think the best possible thing for everyone would be to be born into the best possible circumstances right
8020415 and we think that means healthy perfectly formed with enough food to eat all of the time and probably wed want their parents to be wonderful people who were caring and probably rich just so that their children could have every advantage money could buy
8020416 sometimes i think god doesnt want that not because he doesnt want children to be happy and healthy but because he knows each one of us so well that he knows what each one of us needs to accomplish his purpose in our lives
8020417 which is what to make us work really hard for what we get or just to make us miserable
8020418 so he puts every single person ever born in a box the box is what you are given that you havent any say in like what sex you are what you look like what your race is who your parents are what country youre born in what your financial situation is growing up what situations come your way
8020419 like the circumstances surrounding your conception but the improtant point is that you have no control over any of these things theyre just given to you
8020420 the important thing to remember is that god has given each person the best box for that particular individual and that gods purpose is always always in the best interest of that person whatever you and i may think his or her circumstances look like on the surface
8020421 so youre telling me god engineered my circumstances for my ultimate good that he wanted me born but he didnt want jim lightman to act as my father im sorry nana but im not so sure this gift as you call it is better for me than having my mother and real father stay married i think you just dont like jim lightman because he did something that hurt your daughter
8020422 oh honey thats true i dont like jim lightman because he hurt my meg but dont think im basing my box theory on this one situation i may not be right about it but up till now its made more sense than anything else ive heard
8020423 and you dont have to believe me laurie it just something i wanted to share with you and maybe give you something to think about
8020424 i dont know about you but im getting sleepy i made up the bed for you in your mothers old room you know where the towels and everything are
8020425 good night sweetheart thank you for listening to my lecture i dont know you may be right but im awfully glad youre my granddaughter and youll let an old lady think youre here by divine decree and not just an accident wont you

8020918 outside the military however i would propose contra mccain a ban against all forms of torture coercive interrogation and inhuman treatment except in two contingencies 1 the ticking time bomb and 2 the slower fuse high level terrorist such as ksm each contingency would have its own set of rules in the case of the ticking time bomb the rules would be relatively simple nothing rationally related to getting accurate information would be ruled out the case of the high value suspect with slow fuse information is more complicated the principle would be that the level of inhumanity of the measures used moral honesty is essential here we would be using measures that are by definition inhumane would be proportional to the need and value of the information interrogators would be constrained to use the least inhumane treatment necessary relative to the magnitude and imminence of the evil being prevented and the importance of the knowledge being obtained
8020919 these exceptions to the no torture rule would not be granted to just any nonmilitary interrogators or anyone with cia credentials they would be reserved for highly specialized agents who are experts and experienced in interrogation and who are known not to abuse it for the satisfaction of a kind of sick sadomasochism lynndie england and her cohorts indulged in at abu ghraib nor would they be acting on their own they would be required to obtain written permission for such interrogations from the highest political authorities in the country cabinet level or from a quasi judicial body modeled on the foreign intelligence surveillance court which permits what would ordinarily be illegal searches and seizures in the war on terror or if the bomb was truly ticking and there was no time the interrogators would be allowed to act on their own but would require post facto authorization within say 24 hours of their interrogation so that they knew that whatever they did would be subject to review by others and be justified only under the most stringent terms
8020920 the journal assumes that only the worst of the worst will be subjected to torture when it comes to ticking time bombs

8020922 candor and consistency are not always public virtues torture is a crime against humanity but coercion is an issue that is rightly handled with a wink or even a touch of hypocrisy it should be banned but also quietly practiced those who protest coercive methods will exaggerate their horrors which is good it generates a useful climate of fear it is wise of the president to reiterate u s support for international agreements banning torture and it is wise for american interrogators to employ whatever coercive methods work it is also smart not to discuss the matter with anyone

8021073 unfortunately some of our fans could not handle the intense and exciting buzz of crack and have ruined it for the rest of us therefore our vendors will no longer carry this item youll have to get it in the parking lot like everyone else

8021096 the minister well knew subtle but remorseful hypocrite that he was and yet by the constitution of his nature he loved the truth and loathed the lie as few men ever did therefore above all else he loathed his miserable self his inward trouble drove him to practices more in accordance with the old corrupted faith of rome than with the better light of the church of which he had been born and bred in mr dimmesdales secret closet under lock and key there was a bloody scourge

8021135 maar je kan niet altijd maar geluk blijven hebben dan is er kennelijk toch een kwaliteit die je met je meedraagt want gemiddeld gezien heeft iedereen in zijn leven evenveel geluk de n maakt er alleen beter gebruik van dan de ander dus wat is geluk dan nog dan is geluk alleen maar het vermogen om effectief te zijn
8021136 why didnt you just tell those girls they were being mean and scoop lillie out of there
8021137 if something goes wrong at 5 000 feet you cant pull over and raise the hood
8021138 so its a good idea to check things out before you go if the wings are gonna come off better if we find out now
8021139 if the tip of that thing ever rests on top of the cap then you better land
8021140 its the most difficult plane to learn how to fly but when you can land one of these successfully everything else will seem easier
8021141 since this is your first lesson you can take it up but id better land it
8021142 release the brakes give her a little throttle and taxi down there check your mags and when i tap you on the shoulder give her full throttle but keep it straight and watch for other aircraft
8021143 this thing will almost fly itself if you let it watch
8021144 i was sorry to see it end i almost felt like
8021145 of course neither one of us probably would have survived
8021146 once you got your balance you were a little wobbly then as you went a little farther you started feeling pretty confident but because it was so new to you all you had to do was hit a pebble or get off balance just a bit and youd fall over right
8021147 flying is the same way son just when you begin to feel like youre in command some little pebble of a problem hits and you lose all control
8021148 you see its kinda like life you have no control over anything but yourself if you put yourself in an airplane thats all you can control you cant control the other airplanes if they want to fly in your airspace the only thing you can control is your reaction if youve only been flying a short time youre probably looking at your altimeter or the scenery or your compass and then bang everybody gets a new set of wings
8021149 i think this is due to the fact that i never forced devotion in myself and never compose hymns or prayers of that kind unless it overcomes me unawares but then it is usually the right and true devotion
8021150 i had an 8 30 training class and first i had to rush evvie off to his teacher then rush back to work then to the training facility in the basement
8021151 and my son was intrigued he wanted to pull over and listen but i was rushed for time
8021152 i know my kids are smart enough to learn what they need to learn when they need to learn it i just want them to be happy in every moment they can
8021153 this has been a decision and a commitment that has taken a great deal of study consideration and soul searching we know its a great deal of money but we have world class partners in conocophillips and oklahoma state university we all have a lot invested in this and we all stand to benefit from the projects success the trustees felt that a significant leadership pledge would make the difference and indeed it has

8021157 i thought i told you to empty the garbage tonight
8021158 weve all made our share of mistakes in life and thats a part of life but i know the biggest mistake would be to not acknowledge the love and special times we shared together both as father and son and as a family i owe you a thank you for each time when i look back and remember thank you dad i love you
8021159 you survived it is true but what you lost is great as well what have i lost work honor money and so on but isnt there anything i got

8021176 i do believe your stewardship of the ih amp ra has made a considerable impact on its good standing and substantial progress achieved to make it a meaningful and influential organisation
8021177 you represented the association in a very professional and persuasive manner and i suspect your talents will be missed greatly
8021178 i thank you personally for all your efforts to bring education and industry together you had in my opinion a great vision
8021179 i was most impressed with their ability to work with owners of different nationalities while maintaining a high standard of hotel management
8021180 i have the highest regard for your qualifications in large upscale hotel operations
8021181 it is unusual when people of this high calibre get together to form a management company
8021182 it is a common delusion that you make things better by talking about them
8021183 companionism is something we do the art is representational of this energetic dynamic but it is also the dynamic itself literally i could care less about stuffy philosophies from tired artworld mags im interested in energetic aesthetics the physics of what the art is actually doing in the world how it responds to and interacts with humanity i am constantly wondering can art actually contribute to rather than take away from this world can art do something besides being an impetus for vacuous art philosophies and suffering artists tirades and spectacles of death and destruction i think it can in fact ive seen how art can change lives for the better
8021184 help the person in front of you be their companion in some way that does no harm that actually lifts their frequency rather than destroys it we live together share the same resources the same energies the same planet its time to recognize that on a mass scale and stop being obsessed only with competing against each other instead why not create actual good and healing frequencies with and for each other and drop the moralizing thats been as hideous and deadly as the history of religion my intention is to extend this science of frequencies to others through my art with my sincere hope that it changes lives for the better everyone needs this kind of companionism for me who cares how good art looks if it doesnt do any good i want to create good art that does good i want to create art that actually empowers and heals humanity
8021185 my mission was focused on life and the eternal meaning of that life i knew from the laws of physics that energy can neither be created nor destroyed but it can change form so i just figured that if the bulls and the bees dont get all these human diseases then maybe this movie we call life isnt what most people think it is in fact i think most of what all of us are taught is a lie and then when i saw the truth of that fact it set me on fire literally i began an intense study of yoga never did chemotherapy or any anti cancer drugs found out that mind over matter really does work and the cancer disappeared and i found out a lot about myself this man made world we live in on gods planet
8021186 i thought that was incredible to actually take care of people and to love them who in washington even does that these days huh no one they settle for the idea the words but not the deeds i pity them because theyre trying so hard in their own ways but they just dont get it i think all of them dont know what love is much less how to give it its apparent in how they talk to people what they say and how small their own capacity for unconditional joy is thats because theyre distracted by worldly power and their own survival of that power i dont think they realize that god does such a much better job at being god than we do they are consumed and obsessed with all the lower energy stuff that must be transcended before healing joy and peace can take place before a celebration of hope can occur before freedom reigns and not shoddy american politics
8021187 because so many people need help im on a mission its why im doing all this i want to help as many as i can whether thats through supporting habitat for humanity or exposing what needs to be fixed in todays crisis of american schools and education consumer debt healthcare and other areas so many people are being killed off and murdered needlessly whether its through an educational financial spiritual or literal death and its done entirely by peoples own unwillingness to question what is going on in themselves and then in the world and those who know better in government need to stop standing by and watching disaster after disaster occur to those who cant help themselves yet ethics are needed now more than ever well there are some answers to help all that with the energy of success business conference exclusively for ethical entrepreneurs the experts i chose to present are all ethical members who see the value and sense of urgency of my art and the movement that inspires it called companionism
8021188 people who are energy workers or who can sense energy will be able to literally feel the energy coming out of your paintings either as a cooling or heating sensation and basically davids art is what we call organizing hues when we look at what davids art does to the physical body we see an increase in flexibility strength coordination endurance and balance the hues he uses also keep people in a coherent state when exposed to electro magnetic fields from cell phones and other electronic devices through energy testing and applied kinesiology ak testing we are able to see davids art shift the brain into higher consciousness known as the theta state anyone exposed to an environment where davids art is being displayed will experience the positive effects of the art and experience energetic states of harmony
8021189 studies show david scotlands art is scientifically shown to help promote human healing because human theta wave emissions are positively affected by the artists art
8021190 uncle joe knew that great art dealers and collectors do more than simply transact sales
8021191 the colors spirituality and energy of his work is absolutely phenomenal uncle joe would have loved his art and he would have especially loved how david spread it around throughout the community allowing others a chance to experience it i believe uncle joe would have adopted david right away because he has obviously discovered the mystery and resonance of life and death and how understanding the intellect can be second to the wisdom of the heart i believe david scotland has found in art how not to make a living of it but rather a life

8021198 he envisioned a cube one dimension or one axis could represent the impact of a particular innovative effort would it be incremental or revolutionary another axis could represent the process of innovation would it be achieved through painstaking analytic work or through artistic inspiration the third axis was time itself was the innovation driven by the market today or in the distant future none of this would tell his audience what or when to innovate small inventions could be as lucrative as big ones and ideas for next year as disruptive as products for five years hence nor would this offer a foolproof strategy for how to innovate since hiring an eccentric genius could prove as valuable as an overcaffeinated entrepreneur but it did suggest to kim that for any company innovation required visualizing the whole future perhaps within something like this cube a 3 d box where every idea in your portfolio was judged and plotted in relation to its potential impact time to market and creative process
8021199 l ately kim has been thinking about the black scholes model a set of mathematical equations formulated in the 1970s that forever changed how markets operate by providing a way to price options
8021200 it doesnt have to be perfect but if we can create a model that is used by a lot of people as a common tool that would be a great contribution

8021206 most mergers fail if thats not a bona fide fact plenty of smart people think it is mckinsey amp company says its true harvard too booz allen hamilton kpmg a t kearney the list goes on if a deal enriches an acquirers shareholders the statistics say it is probably an accident but a new study puts a twist on the conventional wisdom its not that all deals fail its just that timing appears to be everything deals made at the very beginning of a merger cycle regularly succeed its the rest that fall flat deals struck in the first 15 of a consolidation wave tend to do well at least as measured by the acquirers share performance against that of the broad market the duds come later when copycats jump on the bandwagon even in the merger game there is a first mover advantage
8021207 inditex the parent company of zara is responding to a predicament shared by other companies that come up with game changing formulas eventually competitors catch up forcing the pioneers to do even better to keep their edge please see related story on page b9 low cost carrier
8021208 the company is pressing ahead with its expansion plans even as consumers are slowing down in the u s retailers had their worst monthly sales results in nearly five years in january and some chains are planning to close stores and cut jobs in the last 12 months inditex added 560 stores including entering new markets in croatia colombia guatemala and oman to reach 3 691 stores in 68 countries it plans expansion of a similar scope over the next year
8021209 alarm tags are now attached to garments at the factories in the past at a big zara location such as the four floor store on madrids alberto aguilera shopping street 10 people spent an average of 12 hours a week putting on the tags now inditex estimates those salespeople spend 3 more time serving customers
8021210 store managers also use new hand held computers that show how garments rank by sales so clerks can re order best sellers in less than an hour a process that previously took about three hours these orders arrive together with new pieces two days later
8021211 also each of the companys various store brands shipped merchandise separately in the past concerned that mixing even behind the scenes could dilute their images
8021212 in another move to cut costs mr isla inditex ceo installed software in store computers to schedule staff based on sales volume at different times as a result more salespeople work at peak times such as lunchtime or the early evening inditex says the more flexible schedules shaved 2 off the hours staff work
8021213 a lack of technology wherewithal at the board level is today an indicator of poor governance
8021214 so if we have all of this technology and it is so mission critical life critical even why does the business never seem to want to engage with it and discuss its relative merits lets take a look at some analogies in the finance industry the board arent interested in the anticipatory dialling vs predictive dialling characteristics of their sales agents call centre but to the call centre service delivery manager these characteristics have has a direct impact on the way s he performs daily tasks and plans for strategic goals in manufacturing the business unit manager doesnt want to understand the virtues of moving from a swagelok metal gasket face seal to a rubber edged composite compression seal but to the plant engineer the choice has direct impact on the way s he performs daily tasks and achieves the levels of product required by the production planners in the medical industry the primary care executive manager couldnt care less about using the 2 5v fibre optic halogen light sources in the reister ri mini otoscope but to the paramedic the ease with which he can change specula and obtain a clear view of the patients current state can save valuable time and even lives both of which are monitored as part of the hospitals performance indicators to the leaders and strategists of the respective industries these diallers seals and scopes are seen as tools of their employees trade they wouldnt be expected to listen to presentations about their relative merits and the department heads would never dream of inviting them to do so so why does it happen with it why should the senior management be interested in the latest cisco vss 1440 with its 1 4tbps bandwidth capabilities or try to understand the intrinsic worth of the ibm bladecenter hs21 with quad core intel xeon processors the business pure and simple is not interested these are just tools of the trade it is not the technology that is important to the business and it is not always technology which leads to competitive business advantage it is how that technology is utilised to perform the tasks needed to solve a business need

8021231 de leerstof die in nederland werd aangeboden aan de kinderen in het lager onderwijs brachten mij er toe over compa nanzi aan mijn leerlingen uit de eerste klas te gaan vertellen het aanbieden van woorden door bijvoorbeeld een verhaal over duimeliesje voldeed steeds minder in een klas met wel 10 nationaliteiten in amsterdam bijlmermeer de woorden gingen over de hoofden heen ik begon extra te vertellen bijvoorbeeld aan het eind van de schooldag en dat werden onder andere de nanzi verhalen vroeger hoorde ik die zelf op aruba bijvoorbeeld op ocho dia en via de radio waar nilda pinto ze vertelde op mijn 9de jaar kreeg ik van mijn moeder ook het boek dat nilda pinto had geschreven cuentanan di nanzi al snel merkte ik dat het vertellen me goed af ging ik gebruikte daarbij mijn hele lijf en al mijn ledematen ik zag het aan de reacties van de kinderen ze hadden er plezier in ze onthielden de namen de woorden ze wilden de verhalen vaker horen er was een soort herkenning in de ondeugendheid van nanzi surinaamse leerlingen kwamen met vragen over de namen o a van de vrouw en kinderen van nanzi in suriname bleken dezelfde soort verhalen te bestaan alleen noemden ze daar de spin anansi ik werd nieuwsgierig en ging uitzoeken waar die verhalen nu oorspronkelijk vandaan kwamen
8021232 hij was geen gewone figuur uit een fabel door antropologen als trickster benoemd
8021233 ja k heb hem inderdaad ook persoonlijk gekend een zeer aimabele man met humor ik heb hem op verschillende gelegenheden ontmoet in 1989 kocht ik de tweede druk van zijn boek cuentanan di nanzi een onderzoek naar de oorsprong betekenis en functie van de papiamentse spinverhalen wat ik me herinner uit onze ontmoetingen en telefoongesprekken is dat hij mij steeds aanspoorde om zelf onderzoek te gaan doen naar de nanzi verhalen

8021236 our deepest problem is not experiential biological or relational it is moral and it alters everything
8021237 what we think of as ministering the word is little more than a spiritual cut and paste system this kind of ministry rarely leads to lasting change because it does not bring the power of the word to the places where change is really needed in this kind of ministry self is still at the center personal need is the focus and personal happiness remains the goal but a truly effective ministry of the word must confront our self focus and self absorption at its roots opening us up to the vastness of a god defined god centered world unless this happens we will use the promises principles and commands of the word to serve the thing we really love ourselves
8021238 from the rise and fall of governments to tomorrows weather to the exact location of every human being the universe is under gods control he has the power and authority to do exactly what pleases him anywhere he chooses to do it gods sovereignty clearly teaches that god has a plan for this world and the people in it
8021239 every time you love your enemy you are resting in the sovereignty of god every time you speak lovingly and softly in the face of someone elses anger you are choosing to rest in the sovereignty of god every time you resist the temptation to win an argument at all cots you are resting in gods sovereignty because he rules nothing you do in obedience to him is ever futile your life has meaning and purpose because your are included not only in the plan of the one who rules it all but also in his family
8021240 my daily behavior is my attempt to get what is important to me in various situations and relationships my choices and actions always reveal the desires that rule my heart i never come empty

8021250 whats behind the rope in the cove will it ever open so we can go through
8021251 well its my work not anyone elses i decide what it is if it is art and not anyone else anyone elses opinion to me has no bearing on the creative process therefore anyone elses opinion about me or my work is totally irrelevant and probably the beginnings of pipe dreams and specious arguments by lower frequency persons who are just like the walking dead jesus has a few words to say about those people and i happened to agree with his advice let the dead bury the dead i mean theyre not happy anyway which is sad
8021252 frankly those things are not my audience i deal with people who know theyre alive and who value willingness acceptance reason love joy peace and enlightened wisdom of pure consciousness nothing else matters and no one else matters love does not condemn criticize or complain and i will not use the creative muse that runs through me to expose violence hatred prejudice or ignorance i will not do it i am here to join with people in remembering all of who we really are thats it

8021373 taking their cues from the teaching of jesus the earliest followers finally came to realize that they didnt need holy buildings or special places to meet with god they saw themselves as living stones built together into a new organic temple made up of the people of god they believed that the spirit of god dwelled within this relational temple this sanctuary as community see 1 corinthians 3 16 17 ephesians 2 19 22 and that their entire lives were altars upon which to offer sacrificial love to god and others see romans 12 1 because of jesus they understood that all of life is holy and every relationship sacred
8021374 what weve ended up with are vague reflections of what jesus was in the gospels

8021412 een mooier lichaam door bodybuilding oefenprogrammas voor mannen en vrouwen
8021413 ik ben geboren op 10 maart 1963 in veeris otrabanda willemstad s morgens om 06 00 uur mijn vader werkte in de haven hij was oorspronkelijk van bonaire waar hij lootjes verkocht met de fiets reed hij het eiland rond later werkte hij als taxichauffeur
8021414 op mijn 3 de vertrokken we met ons gezin we waren toen nog met zn vieren naar bonaire daar kreeg mijn moeder nog 2 kinderen en waren we nu dus met 4 meiden na de bevalling van de 4 de ging mijn moeder ook loten verkopen zij reed een ford cortina ik hielp haar als ik niet op de kleintjes hoefde te passen ik was toen een jaar of 11
8021415 op 14 jarige leeftijd ging ik in een boetiek werken bij een mevrouw die getrouwd was met een pastoor
8021416 nou ja mijn vader was ook bodybuilder hij had een aantal toestellen en de benodigde attributen thuis dus zijn sportmakkers kwamen bij ons aan huis om te trainen ik groeide er dus van kleinsaf aan mee op en ik wilde dat k ik wilde ook met die apparaten aan de gang uitproberen samen met mijn neefjes en nichtjes bouwden we onze eigen gewichten een ijzeren staaf 2 blikken frysia flag cement in die lege blikken poedermelk de stang links en rechts tot op de bodem in die blikken even wachten tot het cement hard geworden was en we konden beschikken over een halter
8021417 die lieten het oogluikend toe ma die riep dan nog wel eens sha waar zit je en sha ben je nu al weer maar ze hebben het me nooit verboden alleen als ik er teveel mee bezig was of als ik met gewichten oefende die eigenlijk te zwaar voor mijn leeftijd waren grepen ze wel in hoor
8021418 ja natuurlijk ik was ook actief in andere sporten ik deed aan volleybal korfbal baseball voetbal een beetje karate en fietste ook heel veel
8021419 ja toen werd de zoon van de eigenaar verliefd op me en buiten mij om ging hij naar mijn vader en moeder en vroeg om mijn hand hij wilde trouwen daar was ik nog aardig pissig over want ik was toen met een ander vriendje
8021420 die mensen van die boetiek waren seventh day adventists en daar ging ik me ook wel voor interesseren dus als ik niet aan het sporten was op de gym zat of op mijn zusjes paste hielp ik in de kerk gordijnen naaien decoraties maken de spullen klaar zetten voor de dienst
8021421 afijn mijn moeder en vader zagen het wel zitten met die zoon van de boetiekeigenaar ze vonden dat wel een goede partij
8021422 wat denk je ik leerde vrij gemakkelijk en na de huishoudschool deed ik de avondmavo en later nog de hotelvakschool
8021423 pas in 2004 kon ik eigenlijk weer voldoende tijd besteden aan het trainen voor de competitie aan de kampioenswedstrijden georganiseerd door de ging ik weer meedoen in 2006 en ben toen arubaans kampioen geworden

8021428 if you knew you had only one month to live how would you live your life would you live your life differently than you are now
8021429 usually people with a strong faith dont have as much fear of death
8021430 they have a lot of peace a clarity of purpose in living their lives
8021431 we want to help people not just to exist but to come alive
8021432 we want to get to that place where if we heard that we had one month to live we wouldnt have much to change
8021433 commit with gods strength to live the next 30 days as if they are my last so i can experience life to the full
8021434 as a sikh i am admonished to live every day as though it were my last
8021435 if we live righteously then we must live that way whether we have 30 years 30 days or 30 seconds to live
8021436 that have helped to guide me on this particular path
8021437 i imagine i would be bolder about sharing my faith
8021438 i imagine at the grocery store checkout telling the cashiers ive been acquainted with for years and years ive got 26 days left before i go to meet my maker i want to tell you about the bahai faith itll change your life heres a little book and my number why not
8021439 it is a law of the bahai faith that each person should write one
8021440 i would contact family and friends convey to them my deepest love for them i would ask them to forgive me for any way i might have hurt them likewise i would assure them of my total forgiveness of them
8021441 our sages taught that god asks three questions when he encounters the nearly deceased did you study torah daily were you always fair in your business dealings and did you amply partake of lifes permissible pleasures
8021442 on that basis if i found out i had a month to live id ask my wife and kids what would be their dream monthlong family vacation pay the fair price on everything and bring along a few favorite volumes of torah teaching to peruse each morning before hiking or waterskiing or sightseeing or going to the western wall in jerusalem near the end of the last day
8021443 because the reality of death is always part of our life
8021444 all of his or her actions conform to the rules laid out in the quran and elaborated upon by prophet muhammad peace be on him because the sole purpose of a muslims life is to seek allahs pleasure
8021445 repeatedly ask allahs forgiveness and to save me from the torture of the grave and to grant me with his mercy a place in heaven
8021446 if i knew i were to die tomorrow i would plant a tree today
8021447 just another one of the steps that i am taking on my way back to the loving arms of the creator
8021448 i do not live my life with regrets nor i should haves
8021449 i continually feel think and evaluate what i truly believe or know to be true for me in each moment i live my life trusting that i am making the right choice at that moment
8021450 the most difficult lie i have ever contended with is this life is a story about me
8021451 our real estate experience with the smith group was very helpful and very pleasant carol did a wonderful job in helping us find our home with support during and after carol put our interests first all of the time

8021455 i think that randal and i are very lucky to have found you and your team thank you for the article nobody knows more about the real estate market in fort myers and the cape than you do so im inclined to agree with him and you our home in coconut creek is perfect for us by the way randal told me to tell you he really appreciates that you are still keeping an eye out for us we tell everyone we know that you are taking extremely good care of us and theyd be in great hands if they were to sell or buy with you
8021456 which paints a fairly frightening story of our governments fiscal condition based on its issuance of a 2007 annual report
8021457 whats notable is that walker is the comptroller general of the united states and head of the u s government accountability office gao
8021458 for the 11th year in a row that is for each year the federal government has prepared consolidated financial statements and submitted them for an audit the gao could not express an opinion on the governments books primarily because of material weaknesses in financial reporting
8021459 of the 24 federal agencies that fall under the aegis of the cfo act of 1994 19 did not produce a clean set of books the worst offender by far is the department of defense the gao said that the agency could not accurately account for its property plant and equipment which make up 69 of the governments total
8021460 it seems clear that our nation is on an imprudent and unsustainable long term fiscal path that is getting worse with the passage of time
8021461 what the financial report of the united states government makes crystal clear is that the growth of federal mandatory spending now more than 62 of the total budget is unsustainable in the long run the same clarity about the governments discretionary spending however wont emerge until the pentagon drains its financial management swamp who knows what horrors lurk therein
8021462 when it comes to joint injuries rotator cuffs are the repeat offenders
8021463 the ice raid is in progress right now at howard industries in laurel mississippi
8021464 now we are all waiting to see what will happen to people being arrested at howard industries
8021465 we had been expecting the raids either on the coast or in hattiesburg we were getting information that ice was in hotels in the coast and other preparations were going on in hattiesburg
8021466 most of what we are getting today is that ice is focusing on jones county but havent had calls from all areas we have had calls from chicken plants in and around laurel we had expected the raids to occur at chicken plants it was a surprise its a different industry howard industries gets state and federal funding to operate
8021467 the national flood insurance program is critically important to our state we cant wait any longer to make the serious reforms needed to guarantee this programs viability
8021468 i will continue working to make this bill even stronger we need to find solutions that help florida and other states deal with the multi peril threats posed by hurricanes and the insurance availability crisis that is plaguing coastal areas
8021469 the turn of the century developing world now often confronts more of a problem with fat than it does with famine
8021470 or b by the year 2000 obesity was a larger global problem than famine
8021471 now often more of a problem with fat than with famine
8021472 each year i bury a couple hundred of my townspeople
8021473 our real estate experience with the smith group was very helpful and very pleasant carol did a wonderful job in helping us find our home with support during and after carol put our interests first all of the time

8021478 climate change is the most important environmental issue of our generation i voted to move this issue forward in congress because florida is uniquely vulnerable to the threats of rising sea levels and intensified hurricanes that could result if carbon emissions continue to go unchecked
8021479 though i voted to move the debate forward it is clear by the result that serious modifications to this bill are necessary for it to clear the legislative hurdles before it
8021480 this is a great day for indian boxing weve been under a lot of pressure recently so one of us had to do it
8021481 this was the best fight of my life because ive achieved something for the country i want to thank all the indian people for praying for me

8021484 i felt comfortable at all times and will probably only need to wear a thicker base for the winter
8021485 overall im so impressed with this jacket each time ive bought a new jacket in the past ive hoped that it would work that well and pretty much given hope after my last purchase turned out to be another bin bag
8021486 the jacket itself for me was perfect honestly i wouldnt change a thing at all it felt so comfortable and light and performed to the highest of standards i hope you make this jacket a major selling item on your website
8021487 obscene language or gestures in a way that causes public inconvenience annoyance or alarm
8021488 sir these boys have no money and no credit cards can i give them a couple of rooms

8021490 where i also met the late james brown sammy was the same off stage as he was on an absolute unadulterated scream
8021491 i do believe your stewardship of the ih amp ra has made a considerable impact on its good standing and substantial progress achieved to make it a meaningful and influential organisation
8021492 you represented the association in a very professional and persuasive manner and i suspect your talents will be missed greatly
8021493 i thank you personally for all your efforts to bring education and industry together you had in my opinion a great vision
8021494 i was most impressed with their ability to work with owners of different nationalities while maintaining a high standard of hotel management
8021495 i have the highest regard for your qualifications in large upscale hotel operations
8021496 it is unusual when people of this high calibre get together to form a management company
8021497 what they dont tell you is that the front load is very high
8021498 these loans are very profitable to write in the short term
8021499 can you imagine if you have nowhere to go to
8021500 they should take their time do their homework do some reading about the topic
8021501 theres a lot of jargon and lingo they should get down
8021502 people lose homes all the time when they default on their mortgage
8021503 what are you going to do with that equity you cant take it with you
8021504 the first take away should be that every case is different and should be determined on a case by case basis
8021505 there are little pools of money around seniors that they are not aware of
8021506 it looks a lot like free money and a lot of people miss the fine print
8021507 many customers only pay attention to two or three variables in a loan
8021508 a zillion questions such as what will happen if i get sick and go into a nursing home

8021534 when we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives mean the most to us we often find that it is those who instead of giving advice solutions or cures have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a warm and tender hand the friend who can be silent with us in a moment of despair or confusion who can stay with us in an hour of grief and bereavement who can tolerate not knowing not curing not healing and face with us the reality of our powerlessness that is a friend who cares

8021566 toen het boek klaar was heb ik ze voor de grap geteld
8021567 ik wilde dat het een boek zou worden om trots op te zijn en goed leesbaar voor kinderen van deze tijd nieuwe generaties moeten gemakkelijk kennis kunnen nemen van deze gelaagde en voor velerlei uitleg vatbare spinverhalen maar tegelijkertijd moest de authenticiteit bewaard blijven
8021568 op papier hoor je die stemmetjes niet dus moet je erbij schrijven wie wat zegt er waren nog veel meer vertaalproblemen zo wordt er in een verhaal blauwe zeep genoemd zeep voor arme mensen in nederland heet dat groene zeep
8021569 de samenwerking verliep naar ieders wens het heeft talloze e mails gekost zeker zelf ben ik tijdens de voorbereidingen twee keer naar nederland geweest waarbij ik meerdere keren met lieke van duin dominee baart en ren e koldewijn gesproken heb
8021570 ik vond het belangrijk dat niet n illustrator gevraagd zou worden voor het boek maar meerdere dat was een heel bewuste keuze om zodoende verschillende interpretaties van de spinfiguur in beeld te krijgen de n beeldt hem af als spin een ander als mens en de derde als een mix van de twee
8021571 de verhalen zijn altijd het belangrijkst geweest maar omdat we er nu een boek van maakten wilde ik het beeld net zo belangrijk maken als de tekst ik heb tekst en beeld dus gelijkwaardig behandeld de beelden staan bijvoorbeeld afwisselend ook op de rechterpagina terwijl doorgaans die rechterpagina gebruikt wordt voor de tekst en de linker voor de tekeningen
8021572 het leent zich prima voor nederlanders om papiaments te leren of andersom voor antillianen en arubanen om beter nederlands te leren

8021600 sometimes not all the time an understanding is not necessary especially if its something that were just not built to understand sometimes we just need to respect the wishes of another person and treat them accordingly even with no understanding of why

8021602 if the status quo is kept no economic development more conservation land expenses no thorough review of the budget and no review of services provided we will all suffer the consequences of taxes spiraling out of control and services that are not commensurate with the level of taxes we pay

8021608 jongeren gebruiken de nieuwe technologie n om met elkaar te communiceren en aan elkaar mee te geven waar ze zich bevinden
8021609 het internet is voor hen alledaagse kost ze zijn born on the web ik merk dat voor jongeren vandaag connectiviteit belangrijk is terwijl vroeger mobiliteit de eerste prioriteit was hij spaart niet meer voor een brommertje maar voor een mobiele telefoon of pda
8021610 een mooi voorbeeld zijn de aanslagen van elf maart 2004 in madrid
8021611 betogingen werden toen georganiseerd door de verspreiding van smsjes op het internet verschenen fotos gemaakt met mobiele telefoons die beelden stonden dankzij de gsm technologie en moblogging mobiel webloggen op websites terwijl de betogingen nog aan de gang waren
8021612 i city is geen speeltuin maar een geleide wandeling door een proeftuin
8021613 er kwamen teveel beloften en het haperde aan de uitvoering waardoor de
8021614 i city is t gesloten en dat stokt de ontwikkeling van nieuwe programmas maar het heeft in hasselt en limburg wel een mindset gezet waarbij mobiele toegang tot het internet geen vies woord is
8021615 het vergt moed om aan een dergelijk iets te beginnen
8021616 het komt er dus op aan om bloggers aan te spreken die zelf in staat zijn om hun lezers te overtuigen
8021617 u bent gered nooit meer alleen binnen 24 uur krijgt u via de post een vrouw vriendin ma tresse thuisgestuurd en u mag haar houden zolang u dat wilt
8021618 wilt u graag een paar vrouwen ineens ontvangen rent a wife heeft een doblo triplo en een multiploformule ter beschikking daarmee kunt u twee drie of acht vrouwen volgens een rotatiesysteem afwisselen
8021619 het is een parodie van een e commercebedrijf we willen de consument verrassen maar niet misleiden
8021620 de initiatiefnemers steken onder het mom van het economisch belang de draak met de ethiek een deontologische code en talrijke wettelijke bepalingen te beginnen met het verbod op de mensenhandel
8021621 de ironische inslag van deze site zal veel mensen ontsnappen
8021622 its like a betty boop butt so perfect and round
8021623 invent the blueprint of the agency of the future its not about cosmetic changes its about profound and unsettling changes at publicis we love this situation theres nothing we french love more than a good revolution
8021624 this is about profound and unsettling changes theres nothing we french love more than a good revolution
8021625 this is the year when were seeing more and more marketers understand that digital is the fulcrum for advertising
8021626 rather than the tonnage approach of the past where advertisers blasted a message across media and hoped to hit interactive delivers the message in the context where people want to see it and often at the point of decision
8021627 ive had to put aside a lot of the things ive learned over the past 20 years
8021628 so much of getting here has been about the technology and thats been foreign to me
8021629 the men were wearing sneakers and had long hair like me and the girls had long legs and miniskirts
8021630 we were able to pay salaries and run all the campaigns
8021631 i said to maurice and the guys i think the groupe should play here and here
8021632 the individual agencies should find competitive positioning to play here
8021633 maurice told me i really like the idea of acquiring digitas but you guys are so expensive i dont see how i can afford it
8021634 we began to get our heads around the fact that simply being the best digital agency on the planet wasnt a winning strategy
8021635 david had seen what the future was like that he wasnt going to break into procter amp gamble and general mills and toyota because the one thing that the agencies have are the long term relationships the history eighty five years on p amp g thirty years on toyota we know more about their brands than the brand managers
8021636 its a huge opportunity to leverage what digitas does in the publicis network
8021637 is by far the best integrator of assets next to omnicom so far he hasnt invested his capital base on a deal gone wrong
8021638 ive got to transform digitas to rethink it as having one kitchen with many restaurants
8021639 lets buy and place bets because we think these shops are hot but were not necessarily going to integrate them and maximize their value
8021640 ive got more heavy duty stuff coming down the pipeline on a scale bigger than we would do in house
8021641 now i dont have to have people crunching out 300 web pages or 50 banner ads
8021642 theres so much interactive work now that agencies are actively turning away 90 of the rfps that come in the door
8021643 you have to be able to concept how thousands of versions of ads are created stored and tagged then delivered through billions of individual media buys because youre buying each impression one at a time
8021644 then you need to be able to read it analytically and learn from it
8021645 google and microsoft are creating the new york stock exchange and the nasdaq for media
8021646 theres no reason we cant be the goldman sachs but it requires us to add folks who really understand markets and math along with our creative and media excellence
8021647 google and microsoft are creating the new york stock exchange and the nasdaq for media theres no reason we cant be the goldman sachs
8021648 the technology allows us to deploy information to the creative team who can see how an ad is downloading how long consumers are spending with it they can see for example that 40 are blowing it up to full screen that 60 are seeing it in the web site etc
8021649 for example topicality can have a huge impact on the success or failure of a specific creative execution were always on the lookout for this in the travel category where digitas has hotel and airline clients
8021650 we dial up a specific execution to make the most of the location
8021651 were talking not just percentile improvements here but major shifts in response from a 10 uplift to even doubling it
8021652 our value at the publicis groupe is to take the complexity away
8021653 were not trying to drag these cmos through the details of what we do we try to give them a front end and say heres how you navigate it and then really focus on delivering what their consumers need based on that insight
8021654 creative is more important in the interactive age than it was before because its on demand our goal is to build creative so good consumers send it to their friends
8021655 its really key to us that we launch with several types of brands larger iconic brands and feisty up and coming brands
8021656 and within those two things we want different types of categories things you can touch and feel and those that are more emotional
8021657 is theyd say love it love it love it when are you launching it was a tragically valid question
8021658 its a big idea but to bring it together requires deal after deal after deal youre constantly spinning plates
8021659 the spontaneous response was so great we have been a little too optimistic
8021660 the reality is clients were enthusiastic but from being enthusiastic to writing a check there was a difference we are in a business we understand that
8021661 its when you are in a dark room and dont know where the armchair is or the table is and you bump your knees boom boom in the end you find your way and the light is on i believe the light is about to be on
8021662 give me a call when you get back from l a an honest assessment please
8021663 the goal became to launch with a mother lode of content that would attract a mother lode of traffic
8021664 everything that goes through our doors whether its a paying client or not is cherry picked at the end of the day if were really good at our job well have the ability to make something hip
8021665 in this audience shopping is a much bigger experience than just exchanging money theres a social currency to just being informed and expressing yourself through the things that you love we want to embrace all that
8021666 our advice was to make sure the experience extended beyond the site
8021667 so we suggested they create more social network linkages and construct the site so that pieces could be pulled into myspace pages or linked to widgets
8021668 clients pay for time spent for clicks youre only paying for definitive eyeballs not the promise of eyeballs if people arent clicking through no ones being charged
8021669 its a world in which leverage doesnt come from size it comes from knowledge
8021670 we need all the consultants and operational folks we can get but we also need artists and poets
8021671 we dont need no education we dont need no thought control no dark sarcasm in the classroom teacher leave them kids alone all and all youre just another brick in the wall
8021672 the covenant to come at once straight to the matter however offensive the doctrine may be the covenant has relationship to the elect and none besides
8021673 i pray for them i pray not for the world but for them which though hast given me for they are thine
8021674 as many as shall believe as many as shall trust in christ as many as shall persevere unto the end as many as shall enter into the eternal rest so many and no more are interested in the covenant of grace
8021675 but why were certain men the objects of it and why others not i answer sovereign grace guided the pen it was not the merit of man it was nothing which god foresaw in us that made him choose many and leave others to go on in their sins it was nothing in them it was sovereignty and grace combined that made the divine choice
8021676 no let god be god and let man shrink into his native nothingness and if god exalt him let him not boast as though god found a reason for the deed in man
8021677 thou hast heard it has thou received it in thy heart and laid old on it then thou art one of those in the covenant and why should election frighten thee if thou hast chosen christ depend upon it he has chosen thee
8021678 a best case scenario is full recovery but not likely i believe there will be some permanent neurologic damage
8021679 next to the table was a marginally better one and my guest and i asked to be seated there

8021755 ja en toen mijn vrouw zelfs in haar keukenkastjes in plaats van de borden en pannen honkbalpetjes tennisballen en sportboeken vond was het tijd om mijn verzameling te verplaatsen mijn vrouw opperde toen het idee om naast het huis dit bescheiden museum neer te zetten
8021756 in 1998 is het museum officieel geopend en heeft de toenmalige minister van sport edgar vos een toespraak gehouden

8021877 i am totally puzzled as to why both ends of the bridge would come down all at once when my colleague tested it it was very low stress
8021878 i dont think it was overload so it could have been either some fatigue failure or some sudden buckling that would cause the failure

8021909 the citrulline arginine relationship helps heart health the immune system and may prove to be very helpful for those who suffer from obesity and type 2 diabetes

8021912 lycopene which is also found in red grapefruit was historically thought to exist only in tomatoes
8021913 but now we know that its found in higher concentrations in red watermelon varieties
8021914 previous tests have shown that lycopene is much better absorbed from tomatoes when mixed in a salad with oily vegetables like avocado or spinach
8021915 that would also apply to the lycopene from watermelon but i realize mixing watermelon with spinach or avocadoes is a very hard sell
8021916 one final bit of advice for those fourth of july watermelons you buy
8021917 they store much better uncut if you leave them at room temperature lycopene levels can be maintained even as it sits on your kitchen floor but once you cut it refrigerate and enjoy

8021949 in tinker tailor were told that a minor character a strong arm specialist called ricki tarr was recruited to help suppress the malayan emergency before being called back to brixton and refitted for special operations in kenya or in less sophisticated language hunting mau mau for bounty the main implication is that tarr is an unsavoury potentially dangerous person not that the circus plays a nasty role in putting down insurgencies confronted with the practicalities of tarrs work smiley would probably have taken some leave and been spotted sitting rigidly before an old volume of german poetry as happens in one of the books while he silently wept but the need to fight communism always overrides his fretting about british moral credentials however dubious those might be and however much of a hash the cousins might be making of things in vietnam i do find i become a great deal more radical in my old age smiley announces during his final appearance in the secret pilgrim 1991 an inquest into the cold war that also offers some pointers for the future the right people have lost but the wrong people have won capitalism must stage its own glasnost which perhaps it can now that anti communism wont provide ideological cover for low deeds unhappily this isnt the view taken by the likes of sir anthony joyston bradshaw an arms dealer who once did the circus some favours and cant see why he should stop shipping his toys to african warlords just because the governments gone soft bradshaw comes out with a long rant on this theme my advice is step aside let them slug it out and bloody good luck to em which the narrator dutifully transcribes though not before giving a disconcertingly extended disquisition on sir anthonys barbarous dialect and sawing nasal tones he spoke english as if it were his second language but it was the only one he had he spoke in what my son adrian tells me is called slur which is a slack mouthed belgravia cockney that contrives to make mice out of mouse and dispenses almost entirely with the formality of pronouns it has a vocabulary naturally nothing rises but it escalates no opportunity is without a window no minor event occurs that is not sensational it also has a pedantic inaccuracy which is supposed to distinguish it from the unwashed and explains gems like as for you and i and since the early 1990s le carr s novels have registered his growing dismay at on the one hand the bungling or ignoring of opportunities for the great powers to act less thoughtlessly particularly in the developing world and on the other the strange accents and linguistic abuses of the rapacious new elite perhaps the idea as cyril connolly writes of eminent victorians is to make his points in the language through which the bourgeois ear might be lulled and beguiled but the results are jarring

8021993 kami berharap kondisi itu tidak menjadi nol persen minimal masih 10 persen
8021994 memang di dalam peraturan presiden perpres nelayan tidak termasuk pengguna mitan bersubsidi karena yang mendapatkan subsidi hanya rumah tangga dan usaha kecil menengah ukm

8021996 kewenangan penundaan penarikan mitan saya kira bukan berada di tangan pertamina melainkan berada di pemerintah pusat dan badan pelaksana hulu minyak dan gas bumi bp migas untuk itu pengajuan penundaan harus dilakukan pemerintah daerah untuk membuktikan bahwa mereka benar benar memperjuangkan rakyatnya
8021997 we found that a low level of hdl may be a risk factor for memory loss in late midlife this suggests that low hdl cholesterol might also be a risk factor for dementia
8021998 but it is possible that hdl cholesterol prevents formation of beta amyloid
8021999 hdl could also affect memory through its influence on atherosclerotic disease and stroke or vascular injury finally hdl cholesterol may influence memory through its anti inflammatory and antioxidant effects
8022000 many previous investigations into the association between lipids and memory in the elderly have focused on total or ldl cholesterol because of their status as proven risk factors for cardiovascular disease
8022001 our results show hdl cholesterol to be important for memory thus physicians and patients should be encouraged to monitor levels of hdl cholesterol
8022002 it is tempting to speculate that increasing levels of hdl c or

8022013 as a couple with two young children we were becoming increasingly concerned about our impact on the environment and we started to look actively at how we could reduce our own carbon footprint like many families up and down the country we realised there are no easy answers and you cant suddenly become green overnight the philosophy we adopted was to think big and act small both my wife and i work in an office environment and we noticed that we are always using search engines and thats where the idea for click4carbon came from
8022014 the principle behind click4carbon is to offer users one simple means of reducing their footprint through an everyday activity that they already do we are not trying to reinvent the wheel google is by far the most popular search engine in the world all that we want to do is provide users with that same experience but with a different goal in mind click4carbon is our way of trying to make a difference

8022019 primary finding is that rather than mere experience or even raw talent it is dedicated slogging generally solitary exertion that leads to first rate performance and it should never get easier if it does you are coasting not improving ericcson authors study calls this exertion deliberate practice by which he means the kind of practice we hate the kind that leads to failure and hair pulling and fist pounding

8022055 the finding was focussed on undermining irans nuclear ambitions and trying to undermine the government through regime change
8022056 well create generations of jihadists and our grandchildren will be battling our enemies here in america
8022057 at least ten senior flag and general officers including combatant commanders
8022058 attacking them as a means to get to that spot strikes me as being not the first choice
8022059 too many people believe you have to be either for or against the iranians
8022060 lets get serious eighty million people live there and everyones an individual the idea that theyre only one way or another is nonsense
8022061 did i bitch about some of the things that were being proposed you bet some of them were very stupid
8022062 the process is broken and this is dangerous stuff were authorizing
8022063 the c i a needed the finding to do its traditional stuff but the finding does not apply to jsoc the president signed an executive order after september 11th giving the pentagon license to do things that it had never been able to do before without notifying congress the claim was that the military was preparing the battle space and by using that term they were able to circumvent congressional oversight everything is justified in terms of fighting the global war on terror
8022064 the administration has been fuzzing the lines there used to be a shade of gray
8022065 the agency says were not going to get in the position of helping to kill people without a finding
8022066 the over all authorization includes killing but its not as though thats what theyre setting out to do its about gathering information enlisting support
8022067 the executive branch understands that we are not trying to dictate what they do
8022068 we are simply trying to see to it that what they do is consistent with american values and will not get the country in trouble
8022069 i suspect theres something going on but i dont know what to believe cheney has always wanted to go after iran and if he had more time hed find a way to do it we still dont get enough information from the agencies and i have very little confidence that they give us information on the edge
8022070 is just that notification and not a sign off on activities proper oversight of ongoing intelligence activities is done by fully briefing the members of the intelligence committee
8022071 as a rule we dont comment one way or the other on allegations of covert activities or purported findings
8022072 it will take another year before we get the intelligence activities under control
8022073 we control the money and they cant do anything without the money money is what its all about but im very leery of this administration
8022074 theyve been absolutely unhelpful very damaging and i absolutely dont condone any of their activities and i have yet to see anything since ive been in this job in the way of a public action by iran thats been at all helpful in this region
8022075 when i arrived at centcom the iranians were funding every entity inside iraq it was in their interest to get us out and so they decided to kill as many americans as they could and why not they didnt know whod come out ahead but they wanted us out i decided that i couldnt resolve the situation in iraq without the neighborhood to get this problem in iraq solved we had to somehow involve iran and syria i had to work the neighborhood
8022076 it would happen only if the iranians did something stupid
8022077 one of the reasons the white house selected fallon for centcom was that hes known to be a strategic thinker and had demonstrated those skills in the pacific
8022078 he was charged with coming up with an over all coherent strategy for iran iraq and afghanistan and by law the combatant commander is responsible for all military operations within his a
8022079 when fallon tried to make sense of all the overt and covert activity conducted by the military in his area of responsibility a small group in the white house leadership shut him out
8022080 the coherence of military strategy is being eroded because of undue civilian influence and direction of nonconventional military operations
8022081 if you have small groups planning and conducting military operations outside the knowledge and control of the combatant commander by default you cant have a coherent military strategy you end up with a disaster like the reconstruction efforts in iraq
8022082 fox said that theres a lot of strange stuff going on in special ops and i told him he had to figure out what they were really doing
8022083 the special ops guys eventually figured out they needed fox and so they began to talk to him fox would have won his fight with special ops but for cheney
8022084 fallon went down because in his own way he was trying to prevent a war with iran and you have to admire him for that
8022085 is very open in describing the killings going on inside the country
8022086 a controlled press which makes it more important that it publishes these things we begin to see inside the government
8022087 hardly a day goes by now we dont see a clash somewhere there were three or four incidents over a recent weekend and the iranians are even naming the revolutionary guard officers who have been killed
8022088 this is the ultimate for the iranians to blame the c i a
8022089 this is new and its an escalation a ratcheting up of tensions
8022090 in gardiners view the violence rather than weakening irans religious government may generate support for it
8022091 weve got exposure because of the transfer of our weapons and our communications gear the iranians will be able to make the argument that the opposition was inspired by the americans how many times have we tried this without asking the right questions is the risk worth it
8022092 just because lebanon iraq and pakistan have ethnic problems it does not mean that iran is suffering from the same issue
8022093 iran is an old country like france and germany and its citizens are just as nationalistic the u s is overestimating ethnic tension in iran
8022094 you can always find some activist groups that will go and kill a policeman but working with the minorities will backfire and alienate the majority of the population
8022095 the baluchis are sunni fundamentalists who hate the regime in tehran but you can also describe them as al qaeda
8022096 these are guys who cut off the heads of nonbelievers in this case its shiite iranians the irony is that were once again working with sunni fundamentalists just as we did in afghanistan in the nineteen eighties
8022097 this is a vicious salafi organization whose followers attended the same madrassas as the taliban and pakistani extremists
8022098 they are suspected of having links to al qaeda and they are also thought to be tied to the drug culture
8022099 the new task force will work with the m e k the administration is desperate for results
8022100 the m e k has no c p a auditing the books and its leaders are thought to have been lining their pockets for years if people only knew what the m e k is getting and how much is going to its bank accounts and yet it is almost useless for the purposes the administration intends
8022101 malikis increasingly choosing the interests of iraq over the interests of the united states
8022102 seem to be harming relations with the governments of both iraq and pakistan and could well be strengthening the connection between tehran and baghdad
8022103 the program works because its small and smart guys are running it
8022104 we have to be really careful in calling in the missiles we have to hit certain houses at certain times the people on the ground are watching through binoculars a few hundred yards away and calling specific locations in latitude and longitude we keep the predator loitering until the targets go into a house and we have to make sure our guys are far enough away so they dont get hit
8022105 the special ops guys are pissed off because cheneys office set up priorities for categories of targets and now hes getting impatient and applying pressure for results but it takes a long time to get the right guys in place
8022106 weve had wonderful results in the horn of africa with the use of surrogates and false flags basic counterintelligence and counter insurgency tactics and were beginning to tie them in knots in afghanistan but the white house is going to kill the program if they use it to go after iran its one thing to engage in selective strikes and assassinations in waziristan and another in iran the white house believes that one size fits all but the legal issues surrounding extrajudicial killings in waziristan are less of a problem because al qaeda and the taliban cross the border into afghanistan and back again often with u s and nato forces in hot pursuit the situation is not nearly as clear in the iranian case all the considerations judicial strategic and political are different in iran
8022107 there is huge opposition inside the intelligence community to the idea of waging a covert war inside iran and using baluchis and ahwazis as surrogates the leaders of our special operations community all have remarkable physical courage but they are less likely to voice their opposition to policy iran is not waziristan
8022108 yes its more serious than we have seen but to put it in context we do interact with the iranian revolutionary guard and their navy regularly
8022109 i didnt get the sense from the reports i was receiving that there was a sense of being afraid of these five boats
8022110 the subject was how to create a casus belli between tehran and washington
8022111 be possible to freeze the iranian nuclear program for the duration of the negotiations to avoid a military confrontation before they are completed should this newest attempt fail things will soon get serious deadly serious
8022112 the proposal says that the iranians must stop manufacturing new centrifuges and the other side will stop all further sanction activities in the u n security council
8022113 this could be acceptable to the iranians if they have good will
8022114 i think the americans are deeply divided on the issue of what to do about iran
8022115 some officials are concerned about the fallout from a military attack and others think an attack is unavoidable i know the europeans but i have no idea where the americans will end up on this issue

8022416 the results of this study indicate that in general terms the dietary habits of the population of catalonia regarding fish and seafood consumption do not contribute remarkably to increased pcdd and pcb intake
8022417 this is not going to prevent it if you have many many risk factors and youre overweight its a tool in the prevention strategy
8022418 bazzano and colleagues analyzed data on the diets of nurses health study participants 4 529 of whom developed type 2 diabetes while they were being followed they divided women into five groups based on fruit and vegetable intake and also grouped them based on fruit juice consumption

8022423 do you have to plug your car in at night
8022424 resveratrol has the ability to prevent the first step that occurs when estrogen starts the process that leads to cancer by blocking the formation of the estrogen dna adducts we believe that this could stop the whole progression that leads to breast cancer down the road
8022425 this is dramatic because it was able to be done with fairly low concentrations of resveratrol to stop the formation of these dna adducts in the cells we studied
8022426 ich glaube dass das ein erster schritt in einer wandlung des kommerziellen antlitz des snookers ist
8022427 wir bleiben optimistisch dass wir neue sponsoren f r wm und masters finden
8022428 the traditional medical approach of attacking individual diseases cancer diabetes heart disease alzheimers disease and parkinsons disease will soon become less effective if we do not determine how all of these diseases either interact or share common mechanisms with aging
8022429 we believe that the potential benefits of slowing aging processes have been underrecognized by most of the scientific community
8022430 we call on the health research decision makers to allocate substantial resources to support and develop practical interventions that slow aging in people
8022431 if we were to achieve the correct potassium sodium ratio through dietary means there would be less hypertension and cardiovascular disease in the population as a whole
8022432 rapid expansion of oil palm agriculture onto forested lands even logged forests poses a significant threat to biodiversity this study shows that to maximise biodiversity in oil palm plantations the industry and local governments should work together to preserve as much of the remaining natural forest as possible for example by creating forest buffer zones around oil palm estates or protecting remaining patches of forest even then the industrys impact on biodiversity is enormous
8022433 the rapid expansion of oil palm agriculture in southeast asia raises serious concerns about its potential impact on the regions biodiversity unless future expansion of oil palm agriculture is regulated rising global demand is likely to exacerbate the high rates of forest conversion in major oil palm producing countries
8022434 to pay their last respects to one of indonesias best sons
8022435 i cannot understand why i have to forgive suharto because he never admitted his mistakes
8022436 may god bless his soul and forgive his mistakes and sins
8022437 i felt crushed when i heard he had died we have lost a great man
8022438 it used to be easy to find jobs now it is hard
8022439 indonesia of some of the most golden decades and its best opportunity to move from a poor to a middle class country
8022440 when indonesia does finally go back and redo history its people will realize that suharto is responsible for some of the worst crimes against humanity in the 20th century
8022441 president bush expresses his condolences to the people of indonesia on the loss of their former president
8022442 we have not really had a downturn quite like this one in which we lose jobs month after month but the economy somehow manages to grow
8022443 yes lets cut them up and stick them on stuff
8022444 i think they should invent magnetic food so it just sticks to your fork
8022445 we take responsibility as physicians for using unapproved devices on kids
8022446 in the 90s we lost lives in the cath lab patients have died on the table because we were using stents that were made for adults and werent flexible enough
8022447 its a paperwork nightmare they have to commit resources and follow these patients forever
8022448 if im a j amp j stockholder im saying i love kids id love to help them out but move on
8022449 first we need to understand what the needs are and im hopeful that nih will help catalogue the needs
8022450 were all anxious for the dissolvable stent but do you think johnson amp johnson is going to be interested in doing this for babies no they want to do it for adult coronary patients because the numbers are so much larger
8022451 development of pediatric devices is time consuming there are regulatory hurdles and how do you recoup your investment the math generally does not work
8022452 theres not a climate for innovation a great percentage of devices are used off label to accommodate childrens needs physicians are just used to getting by it all comes back to the economics
8022453 there is a hole there and i dont know how to bridge it we need public or private funding
8022454 the agency is very sensitive right now to the need to foster and develop pediatric devices and were looking to develop many different pathways
8022455 that doesnt mean we want to skimp on other key features of clinical trial designs
8022456 our frustrations are the same as everyone elses wed like to work with companies but we dont have the kinds of comprehensive studies that wed like no one has ever done a broad study of gaps and needs and that would be really helpful to direct our efforts
8022457 surgeons tend to be inventive in terms of being able to adapt things that may not be perfect i think we all recognize that it would be better if we had devices developed for specific situations
8022458 honey provided the greatest relief of symptoms compared with the other treatments
8022459 the world health organization has cited honey as a potential therapy

8022465 this would be a way to treat cancer without side effects
8022466 the idea is to marshal the bodys own immune system to fight cancer
8022467 the new manufacturing system allows very rapid production of a vaccine
8022468 i think without the speed it would be hard to convince a cancer patient to wait for a vaccine to be developed rather than going on some other therapy
8022469 and its really ironic that you would make a treatment for cancer out of tobacco that appealed to me
8022470 we know that if you get the immune system revved up it can attack and kill cancer
8022471 the emission reduction goal is achievable if action starts today
8022472 by changing the amount of traveling we do purchasing vehicles with higher fuel efficiency and adopting low carbon fuel standards we can exceed the goals that the minnesota legislature has put before us and be a leader in the nation for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
8022473 this study provides a great starting point for the 2009 legislative session and will help facilitate a thorough debate and good policy development to create cost effective solutions and improve minnesotas energy security
8022474 there is a misconception that it is not possible to make these changes because it isnt affordable
8022475 in fact these methods can be used and save people a lot of money and fuel energy efficiency can help consumers and benefits the economy especially with high gas prices
8022476 the technology to make this happen exists it is just a matter of using it
8022477 the engines we use in our cars are no worse or better than the engines they have in passenger cars in japan or germany the difference is we put our engines in enormous cars
8022478 this is a groundbreaking study which outlines cheaper and environmentally better transportation solutions in a comprehensive way that will make greenhouse gas emission reduction possible for every minnesotan and every american
8022479 we can easily apply these methods to our lifestyle choices and hopefully this will inspire us to start work now
8022480 and from those deaths we derive the benefits of civilization benefits we can afford so easily because those lives were bought so cheaply
8022481 im so impressed with the work that youre doing and the information youre disseminating its just vital for people to get this sort of information

8022483 giants have very strange sexual behaviour where the male has a metre long muscular penis that he uses a bit like a nail gun and shoots cords of sperm under the skin of the females arms and she carries the sperm around with her until she is ready to lay her big jelly mass of a million eggs

8022493 food is like a pharmaceutical compound that affects the brain
8022494 diet exercise and sleep have the potential to alter our brain health and mental function this raises the exciting possibility that changes in diet are a viable strategy for enhancing cognitive abilities protecting the brain from damage and counteracting the effects of aging
8022495 omega 3 fatty acids support synaptic plasticity and seem to positively affect the expression of several molecules related to learning and memory that are found on synapses
8022496 omega 3 fatty acids are essential for normal brain function
8022497 dietary deficiency of omega 3 fatty acids in humans has been associated with increased risk of several mental disorders including attention deficit disorder dyslexia dementia depression bipolar disorder and schizophrenia
8022498 a deficiency of omega 3 fatty acids in rodents results in impaired learning and memory
8022499 the brain and the body are deficient in the machinery to make dha it has to come through our diet
8022500 evidence indicates that what you eat can affect your grandchildrens brain molecules and synapses
8022501 we are trying to find the molecular basis to explain this
8022502 bdnf is reduced in the hippocampus in various cortical areas and in the serum of patients with schizophrenia
8022503 bdnf levels are reduced in the plasma of patients with major depression
8022504 although chemotherapy has saved many lives it often has undesirable side effects
8022505 the people most excited about this research are people who have gone through chemo because our approach may circumvent many of those side effects
8022506 billions and billions of these cells are disposed of every day
8022507 we think these cells have a lot of advantages including their ability to be harvested in large numbers very rapidly
8022508 the nanogel can be viewed as a very tiny piece of paper that wraps around the anti cancer drug like a candy wrapper
8022509 over time or under certain conditions the paper unwraps and releases the candy most anti cancer drugs including ours are insoluble in water however the nanogel is water soluble
8022510 many potent small molecule drugs are sitting on a shelf collecting dust
8022511 often they are insoluble or have many toxic effects we hope to deliver some of these compounds in a more targeted manner via the combination of stem cells and nanoparticles although nanotechnology has made enormous strides toward more focused drug delivery there is always room for improvement

8022523 as much as youre uncomfortable with todays oil prices these are going to be the good old days
8022524 there are more and more people who believe that oil supply prospects are not very optimistic
8022525 we may have difficult days to come in the oil markets
8022526 unconventional oil includes all these things like tar sands and some people count all that stuff as oil
8022527 if you do that then you have a much rosier picture to look at
8022528 contributed to this very fevered psychology in the oil market
8022529 the equation is still a little bit tight but demand is softening
8022530 we just have to wait and see how those factors play out
8022531 the differences in nodal evaluation may contribute to improved long term outcomes at cancer centers and high volume hospitals for patients with gastric and pancreatic cancer
8022532 every reasonable attempt should be made to assess the optimal number of lymph nodes to accurately diagnose stage disease in patients with gastric and pancreatic cancer
8022533 the status of patients lymph nodes is a powerful predictor of their outcome
8022534 we know that the heart deteriorates as people get older and thats largely because they dont stay as active as they used to
8022535 past research has suggested that exercise can reverse some effects of aging and we wanted to see what effect it would have specifically on the heart
8022536 by that gauge the women had a better response to exercise training than the men
8022537 at this point the significance of that isnt clear we know that in animal studies low fatty acid oxidation leads to heart muscle thickening and that when men train their heart muscle often gets thicker than womens it could be that the increase in fatty acid oxidation in womens hearts with training is a reason why their hearts dont thicken as much
8022538 here at the school of medicine we are uniquely able to look at the metabolism of the heart because we have the right combination of technology and expertise in cardiology radiology and radiochemistry
8022539 we are one of the few places that can do this kind of study
8022540 in the past heart failure patients were told to limit their activity
8022541 now more and more were seeing there is potentially a benefit to getting them as active as possible we want to know if heart failure patients will experience the same benefit in heart metabolism with exercise that we saw for older people
8022542 our study shows for the first time the surprising speed with which humans make body fat from fructose
8022543 all three can be made into triglycerides a form of body fat however once you start the process of fat synthesis from fructose its hard to slow it down
8022544 its basically sneaking into the rock concert through the fence
8022545 its a less controlled movement of fructose through these pathways that causes it to contribute to greater triglyceride synthesis the bottom line of this study is that fructose very quickly gets made into fat in the body
8022546 the message from this study is powerful because body fat synthesis was measured immediately after the sweet drinks were consumed
8022547 the carbohydrates came into the body as sugars the liver took the molecules apart like tinker toys and put them back together to build fats
8022548 this is an underestimate of the effect of fructose because these individuals consumed the drinks while fasting and because the subjects were healthy lean and could presumably process the fructose pretty quickly fat synthesis from sugars may be worse in people who are overweight or obese because this process may be already revved up
8022549 there are lots of people out there who want to demonize fructose as the cause of the obesity epidemic
8022550 i think it may be a contributor but its not the only problem americans are eating too many calories for their activity level were overeating fat were overeating protein and were overeating all sugars
8022551 at the international negotiations currently underway in bali governments must agree a process which results in ambitious global emission reduction targets beyond the current phase of kyoto
8022552 crucially this must include a strategy to reduce emissions from forests and help break the cycle of deforestation

8022558 in addition to speeding healing of the canker sores the adhesive patch helped to reduce pain after just three days of treatment
8022559 dentists can give patients the proper medication and treatment options to seal the lesions which will prevent further infection
8022560 also increasing vitamins and other herbs such as vitamin c and zinc can help treat canker sores because they help to regenerate tissue cells

8022566 if you noticed all the nice looking expensive cups were taken up leaving behind the plain and cheap ones while it is normal for you to want only the best for yourselves that is the source of many problems and stress be assured that the cup itself adds no quality to the coffee in most cases it is just more expensive and in some cases even hides what we drink what all of you really wanted was coffee not the cup but you consciously went for the best cups and then you began eyeing each others cups now consider this life is the coffee the jobs money and position in society are the cups they are just tools to hold and contain life and the type of cup we have does not define nor change the quality of life we live sometimes by concentrating only on the cup we fail to enjoy the coffee god has provided us

8022581 in our view this data is a strong indicator that performance of the mobile carriers network is affecting the iphone 3g more than the handset itself
8022582 altogether this furthers our thesis that its highly unlikely that apple is going to wave a magic wand and say 3g problems be gone with a software update
8022583 websphere integration developer upgrade from 6 1 to 6 1 2 two hours
8022584 yes i guess its because of all the tough guys ive put on the screen people go youre a dad youre changing diapers whats up with the world but someone once told me that when you have a child it opens up parts of your heart that you never knew existed and it is so true its like you have a child and you think everything that ive done up until this point is insignificant in comparison to being a father its a beautiful beautiful thing
8022585 actually i had a lot of practice growing up i was the oldest of the children in my family i had to do a lot of diaper changing and lunch making i was taking my little sister to ballet picking up my brother sort of being a super nanny
8022586 thats true whenever the babies started crying theyd call me and id walk over and say ok i can handle this id pick up the baby who was crying and make this little noise like eeeeeee and the baby would stop crying they actually had some t shirts made up for the crew that had eeeeeee on them
8022587 is so marvelous where you can smell the arabic touch there
8022588 but honestly theres nothing offensive uh i did once review a novel by an author who once wrote a book with a lot of sex in it
8022589 but now that i think of it there was an awful lot of drinking on that television skit i mentioned
8022590 im not trying to ride on anyones coattails here or steal anyones thunder or take the words out of anyones mouth or anything

8022593 in the past decade researchers have focused on the benefits of strength training in maintaining independence but until now we didnt have good evidence using an objective performance measure that a walking program would improve physical functioning
8022594 our study found that walking offers tremendous health benefits that can help older adults stay independent
8022595 it gave them an opportunity to make new friends and get to know their neighbors
8022596 aerobic capacity is really the engine that we draw upon for doing the things we want to do whether its cleaning up around the house or running a marathon
8022597 by increasing their aerobic capacity the walking group was better able to perform their daily tasks and had more energy left over for recreational activities like going out dancing
8022598 we know that walking is good for you but too many people still arent doing it
8022599 this study shows that just walking on a regular basis can make a huge impact on quality of life
8022600 social mobility is now less fluid in the united states than in other affluent nations indeed a poor child born in germany france canada or one of the nordic countries has a better chance to join the middle class in adulthood than an american child born into similar circumstances
8022601 the average income of the top fifth of us households in 2006 was almost 15 times that of those in the lowest fifth or 168 170 versus 11 352
8022602 growing inequality in income distribution and wealth raises a profound question for americans can the uniquely middle class nation that emerged in the twentieth century survive into the twenty first century or is it fracturing into a land of great extremes
8022603 the answers to these questions will determine the future of america
8022604 some americans are living anywhere from 30 to 50 years behind others when it comes to issues we all care about health education and standard of living
8022605 woefully behind when it comes to providing opportunity and choices to all americans to build a better life
8022606 the national poll on childrens health report clearly shows that adults in america are very concerned about the problem of childhood obesity and its causes
8022607 while recent studies have suggested that the childhood obesity epidemic may be leveling off the results of this poll reveal that adults in the u s are still very much concerned about this issue
8022608 having this issue among the 2008 top 10 health concerns underscores the importance placed on childhood obesity as a major problem in adults minds
8022609 we found multiple difference in the priority of health problems for kids in the minds of adults by race ethnicity income or some other characteristic what this tells us is that there is no one size fits all public health approach to these issues
8022610 so as doctors nurses and public health officials work to find ways to help their community deal with health issues its important that they remember to tailor their approach to the priorities of the community
8022611 reducing cholesterol levels can reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular disease our research investigated whether ale could be beneficial to otherwise healthy people who had raised levels of cholesterol but were not yet at a stage where they needed standard medical intervention ale may provide another option which people could try over and above a healthy diet in order to help lower plasma cholesterol
8022612 a northward change in temperature patterns may not necessarily correspond to a simple shift in latitude of suitable areas for unusual crops because many plants are sensitive to photoperiod and adapted to a combination of temperature and photoperiod ranges new genotypes therefore might be necessary to meet this new agricultural frontier provided that the available soils are suitable for the crop
8022613 a poleward movement of species in response to climate warming is predictable on intuitive grounds habitat food supply predators pathogens and competitors however also constrain the distributions of species furthermore there must be a suitable dispersion route not blocked by land or some property of the water such as temperature salinity structure currents or oxygen availability movement of animals without a natural dispersal path may require human intervention in the absence of intervention such movement may take hundreds or thousands of years

8022617 you are not the first fellow ive skinned for not doing his job
8022618 it is not unexpected that at times people will not be unanimous in their views
8022619 it is clear there are significant animal health and welfare issues for surrogate mothers and clones that can be more frequent and severe than for conventionally bred animals
8022620 for cattle and pigs food safety concerns are considered unlikely but we must acknowledge that the evidence base is still small we would like to have a broader data base and we need further clarification
8022621 that has been one of the challenges throughout this work
8022622 there are possible concerns there is an impact of animal health and welfare on food safety we need more data
8022623 this study provides the first indication that mindfulness meditation stress management training can have a direct impact on slowing hiv disease progression
8022624 the average participant in the study was male african american homosexual unemployed and not on arv antiretroviral medication
8022625 the people that were in this class really responded and just really enjoyed the program
8022626 the mindfulness program is a group based and low cost treatment and if this initial finding is replicated in larger samples its possible that such training can be used as a powerful complementary treatment for hiv disease alongside medications
8022627 even when we controlled for arv use we still saw these effects whether you are on or off the drugs you are going to see these benefits
8022628 we know that stress has direct effects on viral load
8022629 these marginalized folks typically are experiencing the highest stress levels
8022630 one of the main side effects of this particular treatment was an increase in their quality of life
8022631 everywhere we looked we found evidence of air pollution harming natural resources
8022632 decisive action is needed if we plan on preserving functioning ecosystems for future generations
8022633 deposited pollutants have tangible human impacts mercury contamination results in fish that are unsafe to eat acidification kills fish and strips nutrients from soils excess nitrogen pollutes estuaries to the detriment of coastal fisheries and ground level ozone reduces plant growth a threat to forestry and agriculture
8022634 to safeguard ecosystem health we need a new way of thinking about air pollution one that moves beyond measuring what is put up in the air and captures actual impacts to natural areas wildlife and the services they provide
8022635 we cant assess if ecosystems are harmed by air pollution if we dont monitor them while some good pollution monitoring programs exist our current system is fragmented underfunded and has serious gaps
8022636 our results show that at least for urinary tract infections cranberry juice targets the right bacteria those that cause disease but has no effect on non pathogenic organisms suggesting that cranberry juice will not disrupt bacteria that are part of the normal flora in the gut
8022637 we have also shown that this effect occurs at concentrations of cranberry juice that are comparable to levels we would expect to find in the urinary tract
8022638 when we takes e coli bacteria that have been treated with cranberry juice and place them in normal growth media they regain the ability to adhere to urinary tract cells
8022639 this suggests that to realize the antibacterial benefits of cranberry one must consume cranberry juice regularly perhaps daily
8022640 thats good news for people who do not like to consume a lot of sugary juice
8022641 we see that the obvious victims are not the only victims the bullies are also victims of their own emotional problems
8022642 should urgently alert pediatric practitioners and educators to the need for joining efforts in the prevention of this very serious public health issue
8022643 the high incidence of adverse affects associated with currently available medications has created great interest in the search for an effective and safe alternative treatment
8022644 akba has anti inflammatory properties and we have shown that b serrata enriched with akba can be an effective treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee
8022645 in this study the compound was shown to have no major adverse effects in our osteoarthritis patients it is safe for human consumption and even for long term use
8022646 the distribution of body fat may be as important as the amount of body fat in determining risk of heart attacks
8022647 even a thin person can have fat around the heart
8022648 our findings suggest that local fat deposits rather than total body fat are most related to calcified coronary plaque
8022649 inflammatory mediators released from pericardial fat may promote inflammation in local coronary arteries and lead to coronary atherosclerosis
8022650 because coronary heart disease kills so many people it is imperative to find new treatments and prevention strategies
8022651 my friends and i would take a bunch of different pills and break them up and put them all together and call it confetti it could be any combination of anything we could learn from it and continue to take it
8022652 what you have among over the counter and prescription drug use is a very low perception of risk
8022653 theres very low social disapproval in fact there are parents who almost relieved that their kid is using vicodin and not smoking marijuana
8022654 there are guidelines out there but we dont think that theyre being routinely followed
8022655 these internet enterprises set up a bank account in one country buy their drugs from another country and do their merchandising and sales from another country
8022656 everything is spread all over the globe and in an instant if anybodys on their tail they can switch everything around
8022657 people think that its ok because its a prescribed pill it comes from a credible source even if a doctor has not told you its ok theyve told someone else its ok
8022658 just how hard people will work to get what they want when they are an addict
8022659 more and more we see advertising for kids to get them hooked on high fat high sugar high salt diets
8022660 something had to be done we werent getting honest information from companies
8022661 so much of the data is proprietary that all marketing professors could do is estimate
8022662 we always knew those numbers floating around werent ideal but they were what we had
8022663 its certainly not only about advertising its about fewer physical education programs its about the fact that our children watch more tv and play more video games and are more sedentary
8022664 as a nutrition professional i talk to companies and hear what they pledge to do
8022665 as a mom i dont see a big difference in the marketplace yet when i watch
8022666 we were able to restore function in these animals not by dosing them with estrogen but by enabling them to use the estrogen that was naturally present in their bodies
8022667 we discovered that you can affect the estrogen receptor directly in the hippocampus right where its needed to address memory and spatial learning
8022668 estrogen may act as a growth agent for cancer but in the brain it appears to maintain health and counteract stress
8022669 we wanted to come back and enhance the signaling pathway that makes estrogen functional we used a gene therapy technique that enables us to target the brain but ultimately there could be a pharmaceutical that enhances the signaling pathway solely in the brain
8022670 this research shows that when the estrogen receptor alpha is restored to adult mice that have been missing it their entire lives it is still possible to enhance memory and learning
8022671 this is good news for moving forward to develop clinical interventions and therapeutics because it appears critical damage was not done to brain circuitry during early development there has also been debate about which of at least two estrogen receptors is key to synaptic health clearly estrogen receptor alpha plays a critically important role in hippocampal organization and function
8022672 investigating the impact of genetically replacing the estrogen receptor at the cellular synaptic and behavioral levels is a scientific tour de force which provides a strong foundation for the role of estrogen receptor alpha in mediating estrogen action in the hippocampus to restore select types of memory function
8022673 from a technology perspective their technique to transfect the estrogen receptor is an exciting advance for researching steroid receptors in the brain
8022674 the research brings up the idea that local activation of non nuclear estrogen receptor alpha is important for regulating memory processes in the hippocampus
8022675 this is a fairy tale that this technology is not being used and is not already in the food chain
8022676 anyone who tells you otherwise either doesnt know what theyre talking about or theyre not being honest
8022677 im so impressed with the work that youre doing and the information youre disseminating its just vital for people to get this sort of information

8022679 brassica plants naturally release compounds that suppress pests and pathogens principally isothiocyanates itcs which most people would recognise as the hot flavour in mustard or horseradish
8022680 when itcs are released in soil by green manuring soil borne pests and pathogens can be suppressed and the yields of solanaceous vegetables such as potatoes tomatoes and eggplants can be increased by up to 40 per cent in some cases
8022681 the technique is relevant to developed countries seeking alternatives to banned synthetic pesticides such as methyl bromide as well as poor farmers in developing countries who often have few alternatives for controlling serious diseases in their crops
8022682 it can provide economic and social benefits as improved crop yields lead to increased incomes as well as a range of environmental and health benefits from a reduced reliance on fumigants and pesticides
8022683 the symposium is an excellent opportunity to draw together the latest research on the subject from around the globe

8022687 it has long been known that vitamin a supplementation can reduce mortality in children over 6 months of age our study showed that vitamin a given at birth can also improve infant survival within the first 6 months of life
8022688 this study supports the findings of previous vitamin a studies in southern asia where the evidence is now strong that vitamin a given to newborns can dramatically reduce mortality
8022689 more studies are urgently needed to determine if newborn vitamin a supplementation would reduce mortality among infants in other regions especially africa
8022690 we are excited by the results of this study that build on two previous studies in south asia confirming this low cost intervention can significantly contribute to reducing mortality in the first 6 months of life
8022691 a key next step is to consider the operational issues for using this intervention
8022692 because childhood mortality is greatest during the first few months of life a single dose of vitamin a administered by mouth to a newborn child can save the lives of an additional 300 000 children in asia every year
8022693 that is on top of the one million lives a year that would be saved by dosing all vitamin a deficient children twice a year from six months through 5 years of age
8022694 das geld ist knapp und ich kann mir nicht leisten es zu verschwenden
8022695 das geht jetzt seit ewigkeiten so und ich musste eins nach dem anderen f r sie beschaffen wenn sie keinem ehemaligen spieler helfen wollen worum geht es bei diesem fond eigentlich es hei t ganz klar dass spieler die mit einer krankheit oder finanziell probleme hatten geholfen wird
8022696 aber ich wei nicht wer das sein k nnte schlie lich musste keiner wegen seiner gesundheit den sport aufgeben
8022697 das ist ein teuflisches spiel der mann verfolgte eine snooker karriere und jetzt fallen sie ihm in den r cken das ist so eine schande
8022698 wozu gibt es diesen fond dann es passiert nicht oft dass die spieler ihre meinung offen kundtun weil sie angst vor der wsa haben
8022699 in diesem fall jedoch gibt es niemanden der nicht auf smalls seite steht denke ich deshalb stellen sie sich alle hinter ihn

8022703 you are the gift from god althrough its just a pleasant glance but it can brighten my whole afternoon
8022704 joyce do you know who i really miss at this moment
8022705 is there anything more i should ask for is anything more important than this
8022706 so should i like not jerk it to her anymore
8022707 ladies and gentlemen please turn your attention to section 27 as insert cunning bastard here has a special message for the person sitting next to him

8022710 hi angel i have so much i want to tell you but i dont know how to put it in words so i thought this tape would really show how i feel
8022711 you shouldnt have made such a big fucking deal about the toilet seat being up your shit is in the street outside the apartment
8022712 oh by the way honey i like dudes always have the strap on thing wasnt just to spice things up i really love it in the ass
8022713 honey grab your passport and wear a pretty dress i have a very special surprise for you

8022718 unfortunately this treatment will be relatively expensive and may not be covered by medical insurance or provided by local medical services
8022719 it is likely that hyperbaric oxygen will only be used in the very worst cases where relief is not obtained by any alternative method
8022720 oxygen seems to return the activity of these areas to normal and may be directly responsible for the effect of oxygen on the headache
8022721 whether altered thyrotropin levels occur before or after the onset of alzheimers disease the neuropathologic mechanism is unclear
8022722 in conclusion low and high thyrotropin levels were associated with an increased risk of incident alzheimers disease in women but not in men
8022723 these findings should be considered hypothesis generating and should be validated in other populations before clinical conclusions are drawn
8022724 you have to let it grow germinate a little bit
8022725 some of the active ingredients generated as a result of the germination process are beneficial to you
8022726 the advantage of knowing this key ingredient and its structure is we can now make a ton of it you dont have to rely on rice to produce it or eating rice to get this beneficial effect
8022727 part of the way we know this growth factor works is by increasing levels of good enzymes that are decreased in diabetes
8022728 the game here is how to get the maximum yield with the best quality using the minimum amount of water
8022729 i think with the prices of crops today and with the level of income from agricultural products where it is this project is very feasible
8022730 if we can economise on water usage this can give us the chance to increase our agricultural land by 2m 3m acres through desert reclamation
8022731 food security is coming back as a main issue of concern of many countries because the ability to flow goods across borders is not guaranteed
8022732 the most parsimonious explanation for our results is that older people need less sleep
8022733 its also possible that they sleep less even when given the opportunity for more sleep because of age related changes in the ability to fall asleep and remain asleep
8022734 while humans can sometimes override the homeostatic set point and not sleep when tired there is no evidence that they can sleep when they are not tired
8022735 if older people believe that they need more sleep than they can achieve even when they spend extra time in bed then they may complain of insomnia being awake when wanting to be asleep they may start using medications needlessly if they are tired during the day they should consider evaluation for a sleep disorder that may be interfering with their ability to obtain good sleep at night
8022736 the death rate from coronary heart disease in japan has always been puzzlingly low
8022737 our study suggests that the very low rates of coronary heart disease among japanese living in japan may be due to their lifelong high consumption of fish
8022738 our study clearly demonstrated that whites and japanese americans have similar levels of atherosclerosis which are much higher than in the japanese in japan
8022739 this indicates that much lower death rates from coronary heart disease in the japanese in japan is very unlikely due to genetic factors
8022740 japanese men in japan have equally bad or worse cardiovascular risk profiles as americans but less heart disease how can this be
8022741 what really distinguishes the japanese men from the americans is the fact that blood levels of the omega 3 fatty acids are twice as high in japan as they are in the west
8022742 the take home message from this important study is this traditional risk factors lead to traditional amounts of artery clogging plaque but only when the background diet perhaps the lifetime diet is chronically deficient in omega 3 fatty acids increase the omega 3 intake and heart disease rates in the west should begin to move closer to those in japan while it may take a high omega 3 diet from birth as opposed to popping a few fish oil pills to reach this goal dr sekikawa and his colleagues tell a compelling story that we would do well to heed

8022747 men who come closer to fulfilling their aspirations are more satisfied with their family lives and financial situations and are the happier of the two
8022748 differences between men and women in aspirations for marriage and children are fairly small
8022749 of course one doesnt have to be married to be happy but if thats something you really want and it is for most people then the failure to attain it can have an impact on your overall happiness

8022751 the principal target demographic for energy drinks is young adults ages 18 25 but theyre nearly as common among younger teens
8022752 this is a concern because energy drinks typically contain three times the caffeine of a soft drink and in some cases up to 10 times as much they also include ingredients with potential interactions such as taurine and other amino acids massive doses of vitamins and plant and herbal extracts
8022753 it is widely but incorrectly believed that the caffeine in energy drinks counteracts the effects of alcohol so students will have the energy to party all night without getting as drunk
8022754 while the combination may reduce perceptions of intoxication it does not reduce alcohol induced impairments of reaction time or judgment
8022755 energy drink consumption is correlated with substance use unsafe sexual activity and several other forms of risk taking
8022756 for parents and college officials frequent energy drink consumption may be a red flag or warning sign for identifying a young person at higher risk for health compromising behavior
8022757 although energy drink consumption can be used to predict other problem behaviors it does not necessarily follow that drinking these substances is a gateway to more serious health compromising activities
8022758 it is entirely possible that a common factor such as a sensation seeking personality or involvement in risk oriented peer sub cultures contributes to both more investigation is needed to study these relationships further over longer periods of time
8022759 for many people being an athlete is an important part of who they are
8022760 some go a step farther though and come to see themselves as jocks for them sport is wrapped up in a larger identity that also emphasizes hyper masculinity and a willingness to take excessive risks
8022761 undergraduates frequent use of red bull and other energy drinks should be seen by peers parents and college officials as a potential predictor of toxic jock identity
8022762 thats not surprising to me much of the public hasnt heard of it
8022763 in a sense im just a messenger people need to not only know about coq 10 they need to take it
8022764 everybody accepts the importance of vitamin c the reason the public does not fully appreciate it is that theres no linus pauling for coq 10 there is no champion
8022765 coq is not really in that category of public awareness yet
8022766 nature gave us through 2 5 billion years of evolution a number of fundamental anti aging free radical scavengers that helped us to survive on average only to about 40 years of age until modern medicine came along
8022767 but there are also the lipophilic portions of our cells that make up the non aqueous part
8022768 a mutation took place that now prevents humans from making it
8022769 its essential for several cellular processes for example everyone knows about scurvy
8022770 you can last 30 days maybe 60 days as your cells deteriorate
8022771 thus evolution teaches us that coq 10 is as important as vitamin c but whos teaching this to our aging population nobody
8022772 the price of coq for over 30 years was about 1 600 per kilo as produced by the japanese
8022773 the chinese came along and for the time being have dramatically altered the market by deciding at the government level that they were going to own this important area of dietary supplements coq 10 can now be purchased for as little as 400 a kilo which in principle is great news for consumers
8022774 the future is not about access to coq 10 anymore
8022775 its not about do we have the best synthesis or can we compete with the chinese its about getting it into water so that we can get it into our mitochondria
8022776 the vitamin e portion associates in the middle with itself because it doesnt have any solubility any energy lowering interactions with the water around it
8022777 so on the outside is the water loving portion while the lipophilic or grease loving portion is on the inside when you add the coq it says where would i rather be since like dissolves like the coq 10 goes inside the micelle its 25 nanometers and its crystal clear and its stable at room temperature
8022778 we can also take pharmaceuticals like taxol an anti tumor agent and put them into just water or saline using this pts
8022779 we aim to get organic solvents out of organic reactions
8022780 and were already looking into next generation possibilities all of our green chemistry has come out of being able to put coq10 and other dietary supplements into water
8022781 its an opportunity to affect every person on the planet
8022782 it is important to elucidate the link between these two diseases
8022783 the prevalence of dementia rises with age doubling every four to five years after the age of 60 so that over a third of people older than 80 are likely to have dementia
8022784 this is the first large study to examine the association between coronary heart disease and cognition
8022785 the major risk factors for chd are cigarette smoking diabetes high cholesterol levels and high blood pressure all of these are modifiable and smoking diet and physical exercise are key targets for prevention our results on the link between chd and cognition underline the importance of these preventive measures by highlighting the impact of these risk factors not only on chd but also on peoples cognitive functioning
8022786 for example in men the risk of poor performance on reasoning decreased by about 30 for every five years from the time of the first diagnosis of chd
8022787 it is possible that shared risk factors drive this association it is also possible that heart disease influences cognition through cerebral embolism or decreased cerebral perfusion
8022788 our core hypothesis is that the identification of the risk factors for dementia needs to focus on the determinants of cognitive ageing in midlife and early old age
8022789 once people are very old it becomes more difficult to identify risk factors as the elderly tend to have higher levels of other illnesses and conditions also dementia itself can affect the identification of risk factors as it involves changes in diet and metabolism there is an increasing consensus on this life long view of dementia that events happening in earlier life can have an impact on whether or not dementia develops in older age

8022791 we dont have a crystal ball and cant predict specific bottom lines but the trend is very clear for these eight states and the nation as a whole climate change will cost billions in the long run and the bottom line will be red
8022792 inaction or delayed action will make the ink run redder
8022793 these new state snapshots can help underscore the extent of damage already experienced in various parts of the country
8022794 we hope the data and the trends can help state and local policy makers plan for additional changes ahead
8022795 there are already considerable costs to society associated with infrastructures agricultural and silvicultural practices land use choices transportation and consumptive behaviors that are not in synch with past and current climatic conditions these costs are likely to increase as climate change accelerates over the century to come
8022796 the effects of climate change should not be considered in isolation every states economy is linked to the economies of surrounding states as well as to the national and global economy while the economic costs of climate change are predicted to vary significantly from state to state the negative impacts that regional national and global markets may experience are likely to affect all states and many sectors
8022797 while some of the benefits from climate change may accrue to individual farms or businesses the cost of dealing with adverse climate impacts are typically borne by society as a whole these costs to society will not be uniformly distributed but felt most among small businesses and farms the elderly and socially marginalized groups
8022798 the costs of inaction are persistent and lasting benefits from climate change may be brief and fleeting for example climate does not stop changing once a farm benefited from temporarily improved growing conditions in contrast costs of inaction are likely to stay and to increase
8022799 climate models and impact assessments are becoming increasingly refined yet little consistency exists among studies to enable summing up impacts and cost figures across sectors and regions to arrive at a comprehensive state wide result
8022800 if theres a single bottom line in all of this research its that delaying action on climate change carries a significant cost
8022801 state local and national leaders will save money in the long run by adopting a proactive approach
8022802 youd better not be holding that phone up to your head
8022803 the overwhelming majority of studies that have been published in scientific journals around the globe show that wireless phones do not pose a health risk
8022804 hold it away from a minimum of a few inches a foot or two is ideal
8022805 hold it out two inches and the radiation drops by a factor of four hold it out four inches and it drops by a factor of 16
8022806 they did tests at the university of york and found that under even the worst conditions if you use a ferrite bead you cant even measure the radiation coming off the wire this common device kills the radiation
8022807 bluetooth is only whispering radiation into your ear the problem is some people wear it all the time
8022808 at the very least switch it from ear to ear so you dont have too much exposure on one side

8022813 when corals die off so do the other plants and animals that depend on coral reefs for food and shelter and this can lead to the collapse of entire ecosystems
8022814 these results show that as a group reef building corals are more at risk of extinction than all terrestrial groups apart from amphibians and are the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change
8022815 the loss of the corals will have profound implications for millions of people who depend on coral reefs for their livelihoods
8022816 we either reduce our co2 emission now or many corals will be lost forever
8022817 improving water quality global education and the adequate funding of local conservation practices also are essential to protect the foundation of beautiful and valuable coral reef ecosystems

8022820 this study is the first to examine in young children both the neural response to pain in others and the impact of someone causing pain to someone else
8022821 consistent with previous functional mri studies of pain empathy with adults the perception of other people in pain in children was associated with increased hemodymamic activity in the neural circuits involved in the processing of first hand experience of pain including the insula somatosensory cortex anterior midcigulate cortex periaqueductal gray and supplementary motor area
8022822 although our study did not tap into explicit moral judgment perceiving an individual intentionally harming another person is likely to elicit the awareness of moral wrongdoing in the observer
8022823 thirteen of the children thought that the situations were unfair and they asked about the reason that could explain this behavior
8022824 the full impact of the childhood obesity epidemic has yet to be seen because it can take up to 10 years or longer for obese individuals to develop type 2 diabetes
8022825 children who are obese today are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes as young adults
8022826 recent studies suggest that there have been dramatic increases in type 2 diabetes among individuals in their 20s and 30s whereas it used to be that individuals developed type 2 diabetes in their late 50s or 60s
8022827 this may be the first indication of a type 2 diabetes epidemic among young adults who were obese during childhood
8022828 our society heavily invests in the treatment and management of chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes for adults but it spends very little for the prevention and treatment of childhood obesity to stave off the onset of type 2 diabetes
8022829 if there isnt a significant investment in obesity prevention and treatment during childhood within schools communities and the health care system recent trends in childhood obesity will likely lead to increases in type 2 diabetes among young adults resulting in even greater costs to society and the health care system

8022848 the results of our study suggest that treatment to eradicate h pylori reduces the risk of developing new gastric carcinoma in patients who have a history of such disease and are thus at risk for developing further gastric cancers we believe that our data add to those from previous studies showing a causal relationship between h pylori infection and gastric cancer and also support the use of h pylori eradication to prevent the development of gastric cancer
8022849 yet worldwide gastric cancer kills more people and there is better evidence that

8022852 the scale of rifting in the newly removed areas seems larger and the pieces are moving out as large bergs and not toppled finely divided ice melange
8022853 the persistently low sea ice cover in the area and data from some interesting sources electronic seal hats caps worn by seals that provide temperature depth and position data seems to suggest that warm water beneath the halocline may be reaching the underside of the wilkins ice shelf and thinning it rapidly and perhaps reaching the surface or at least mixing with surface waters
8022854 wilkins ice shelf is the most recent in a long and growing list of ice shelves on the antarctic peninsula that are responding to the rapid warming that has occurred in this area over the last fifty years
8022855 current events are showing that we were being too conservative when we made the prediction in the early 1990s that wilkins ice shelf would be lost within thirty years the truth is it is going more quickly than we guessed

8022860 supplementation with garlic preparations may provide an acceptable alternative or complementary treatment option for hypertension
8022861 because herbs and spices have a very low calorie content and are relatively inexpensive theyre a great way to get a lot of antioxidant and anti inflammatory power into your diet
8022862 if you set up a good herb and spice cabinet and season your food liberally you could double or even triple the medicinal value of your meal without increasing the caloric content
8022863 culinary herbs and spices are all generally recognized as safe and have been time tested in the diet
8022864 indeed some of spices and herbals are now sold as food supplements because of their recognized health benefits
8022865 when you add herbs and spices to food you definitely provide yourself with additional benefits besides taste
8022866 this is not supposed to happen in america in a free society which relies on the engagement of citizens in debate and protest and political activity to maintain that freedom you should be able to attend a meeting about an issue you care about without having to worry that government spies are entering your name into a database used to track alleged terrorists and drug traffickers
8022867 there were about 75 80 protesters at the rally and none participated in any type of civil disobedience or illegal acts protesters were even careful to move out of the way for division of correction employees who were going into the parking lot for work
8022868 americans have the right to peaceably assemble with others of a like mind and speak out about what they believe in
8022869 for state agencies to spend hundreds of hours entering information about lawful and peaceful political activities into a criminal database is beyond unconscionable it is a waste of taxpayer dollars which does nothing to make us safer from actual terrorists or drug dealers

8022875 people with early alzheimers disease who were less physically fit had four times more brain shrinkage when compared to normal older adults than those who were more physically fit suggesting less brain shrinkage related to the alzheimers disease process in those with higher fitness levels
8022876 people with early alzheimers disease may be able to preserve their brain function for a longer period of time by exercising regularly and potentially reducing the amount of brain volume lost evidence shows decreasing brain volume is tied to poorer cognitive performance so preserving more brain volume may translate into better cognitive performance
8022877 this is one of the first studies to explore the relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and alzheimers disease
8022878 the mmse is used to screen patients for cognitive impairment track changes in cognitive functioning over time and often to assess the effects of therapeutic agents on cognitive function
8022879 performance on the mmse is moderated by demographic variables with scores decreasing with advanced age and less education
8022880 the current findings are not intended to encourage the diagnosis of cognitive impairment or dementia based on total mmse scores alone
8022881 instead these results provide practitioners with revised criteria for appropriate management of highly educated older white patients specifically older patients who present with memory complaints reported by themselves or others who have attained a college degree or higher level of education and who score below 27 on the mmse are at increased risk of cognitive dysfunction and dementia and should be referred for a comprehensive evaluation including formal neuropsychological studies
8022882 this study provides direct evidence that governmental action to eliminate polluting coal burning sources benefits childrens neurodevelopment
8022883 these findings have major implications for environmental health and energy policy as they demonstrate that reduction in dependence on coal for energy can have a measurable positive impact on childrens development and health in china and elsewhere
8022884 this is a unique environmental intervention study using molecular techniques to demonstrate the relationship between a cleaner environment and healthier children
8022885 there is an obesity epidemic in the united states and its increasingly recognized as a worldwide phenomenon
8022886 why is everyone getting heavier and heavier one hypothesis is that maternal obesity before and during pregnancy affects the establishment of body weight regulatory mechanisms in her baby maternal obesity could promote obesity in the next generation
8022887 we wanted to know if even among genetically identical mice maternal obesity would promote obesity in her offspring and if the methyl supplemented diet would affect this process
8022888 indeed those on the regular diet got fatter and fatter with each generation those in the supplemented group however did not
8022889 we think dna methylation may play an important role in the development of the hypothalamus the region of the brain that regulates appetite
8022890 twenty years ago it was proposed that just as genetic mutations can cause cancer so too might aberrant epigenetic marks so called epimutations that idea is now largely accepted and the field of cancer epigenetics is very active i would make the same statement for obesity we are on the cusp of understanding that
8022891 the first is worshiping the sun with our leisure time and the other is tanning salons and that gets us to the subset of people that were involved in this study
8022892 the fact that we see an increased incidence among thicker and later stage melanomas suggests that this increase in young women is real and not simply the result of changes in surveillance

8022894 compared with persons of your own age and sex how would you rate your risk of having a heart attack or stroke in the next 5 years
8022895 clearly holding optimistic perceptions of risk has its advantages for men
8022896 it is not clear whether we should seek to disabuse people of optimistic misperceptions in pursuit of changing behavior
8022897 perhaps we should work on changing behaviors by instilling more confidence in the capacity to prevent having a heart attack rather than raising fears about having one
8022898 women are no longer protected from heart disease risk relative to men

8022901 among people of retirement age and therefore less likely to be exposed to work stress the effect on coronary heart disease was less strong
8022902 keeping fit and active also helps to relieve stress and therefore reduce the risk of heart disease

8022909 incandescent light bulbs are the only source of electric light for many thousands of people with light sensitive conditions
8022910 add to this the thousands of people whose conditions or treatments may secondarily cause them to be light sensitive and you have a large number of people potentially being isolated in the dark
8022911 it is important that patients with photosensitive skin eruptions are allowed to use lights that dont exacerbate their condition
8022912 it is essential that such patients are able to protect themselves from specific wavelengths of light emitted by fluorescent bulbs especially as they are often trapped indoors because they cant venture out in natural sunlight

8022917 childrens foods can now be found in virtually every section of the supermarket and are available for every eating experience
8022918 parents may have questions about which packaged foods are good for their children yet certain nutritional claims may add to the confusion as they can mislead people into thinking the whole product is nutritious
8022919 we included food products and packaging that were presented in such a way that children were the clear target audience
8022920 they included products that promoted fun and play had a cartoon image on the front of the box or were linked to childrens films tv programmes and merchandise
8022921 assessing the levels of sugar in the selected food products was a methodological challenge because milk sugars and fruit sugars occur naturally in foods
8022922 the nutrition facts label only displays total sugars and the quantity of added sugars is not always provided by the manufacturer
8022923 this means that the percentage of foods categorised as poorly nutritious due to high levels of sugar is higher than it would have been if information on naturally occurring sugars had been available
8022924 despite this the findings still give us cause for concern
8022925 while caregivers are likely to purchase products that they hope their children will like it clearly can result in a less nutritious diet than they may realise having a healthy diet is especially important given the current rates of childhood obesity
8022926 if a parent sees a product that makes specific nutritional claims they may assume that the whole product is nutritious and our study has shown that that is definitely not true in the vast majority of cases
8022927 using cartoon characters engaged in sport can also create the illusion of a healthy product
8022928 theres every reason to anticipate that it would be happening worldwide
8022929 for years my administration has been calling on congress to expand domestic oil production
8022930 i see no support from anyone making the argument this has near term impact
8022931 this coastline drilling plan is not a serious proposal to help american families
8022932 this is exploitation of pain at the pump to give yet another handout to oil companies
8022933 over 80 percent of americas deep ocean areas are closed to responsible investigation while we purchase much of our oil from unstable countries
8022934 twenty first century technology makes it possible for oil rigs to be located miles away from the coast completely out of sight from shore
8022935 i think if theres an accident the results of the accident would be worse than the higher gas prices now
8022936 i dont think i want to take the chance to damage the environment
8022937 but im obviously worried about the potential of a spill and the water being unsafe for my children
8022938 the reality is accidents happen and when they happen its ugly
8022939 we have very little to gain and everything to lose
8022940 i think its very clear we ought to be starting a process to lift the moratorium
8022941 to suggest theres no activity going on belies the entire nature of how these leases occur
8022942 providing access to these domestic energy resources will send a signal to the rest of the world that the u s is serious about easing the burden faced by american consumers and manufacturers
8022943 for years my administration has been calling on congress to expand domestic oil production
8022944 i see no support from anyone making the argument this has near term impact
8022945 this coastline drilling plan is not a serious proposal to help american families

8022955 our research provides evidence that calorie restriction does work in humans like it has been shown to work in animals
8022956 the next step is to determine if this in fact slows age related tissue deterioration the only way to be certain though is to do a long term study
8022957 there is plenty of evidence the calorie restriction can reduce your risks for many common diseases including cancer diabetes and heart disease
8022958 its had a disastrous effect on the fisheries for sure
8022959 were planting an awful lot of corn and soybeans and a lot of it isnt staying in the ground
8022960 we dont have the ability to see that level of detail
8022961 people may not think they care about dead zones but they certainly care about rockfish and crabs and oysters and they are all affected by dead zones
8022962 they have destroyed their wetlands and theyre paying a price for it
8022963 wir wollen in allen disziplinen qualitativer marktf hrer sein und den abstand zu den anderen mediaagenturen weiter vergr ern
8022964 weve got strong evidence here that people who use their brains more have less brain shrinkage
8022965 i hope people take this as a further call to arms to get out there and use their brains get engaged in anything from tai chi to world travel in the knowledge that it may help delay or prevent the onset of dementia
8022966 this is a significant finding because a small hippocampus is a specific risk factor for developing alzheimers disease
8022967 our prior research shows the risk for dementia is quite malleable even into late life
8022968 it is vital that everyone is involved in cognitive social and physical activities in late life such as dancing tai chi sailing travelling and learning a new language for example
8022969 the high incidence of adverse affects associated with currently available medications has created great interest in the search for an effective and safe alternative treatment
8022970 akba has anti inflammatory properties and we have shown that b serrata enriched with akba can be an effective treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee
8022971 this prospective study provides new evidence that plasma concentrations of epa and dpa are associated with a lower incidence of nonfatal mi among us women
8022972 our findings provide further indirect support that circadian disruption may be etiologically related to breast cancer and may contribute to the rising incidence of breast cancer in newly affluent societies throughout asia
8022973 our results show that at least for urinary tract infections cranberry juice targets the right bacteria those that cause disease but has no effect on non pathogenic organisms suggesting that cranberry juice will not disrupt bacteria that are part of the normal flora in the gut
8022974 when we take e coli bacteria that have been treated with cranberry juice and place them in normal growth media they regain the ability to adhere to urinary tract cells
8022975 this suggests that to realize the antibacterial benefits of cranberry one must consume cranberry juice regularly perhaps daily
8022976 because tea is cheap nontoxic and widely consumed it has a huge potential effect in promoting cognitive health and delaying the onset of dementia
8022977 further studies should investigate whether tea consumption lessens the risk of vascular and alzheimer type dementia
8022978 this is dramatic because it was able to be done with fairly low concentrations of resveratrol to stop the formation of these dna adducts in the cells we studied
8022979 resveratrol has the ability to prevent the first step that occurs when estrogen starts the process that leads to cancer by blocking the formation of the estrogen dna adducts
8022980 we believe that this could stop the whole progression that leads to breast cancer down the road
8022981 if we were to achieve the correct potassium sodium ratio through dietary means there would be less hypertension and cardiovascular disease in the population as a whole
8022982 the improvements in cognition observed in normal gerbils in this study and in rats with impaired cognition in a previous study correlate perfectly with the evidence of increased brain synapses as shown biochemically and anatomically
8022983 this suggests that treating the animals with the experimental mixture affects behavior by increasing the number of synapses in important brain regions
8022984 it may be possible to use this treatment to partially restore brain function in people with diseases that decrease the number of brain neurons including for example parkinsons strokes and brain injuries
8022985 of course such speculations have to be tested in double blind placebo controlled clinical trials
8022986 our study was designed to test a comprehensive and holistic approach to lipid lowering
8022987 these results are intriguing and show a potential benefit of an alternative or naturopathic approach to a common medical condition
8022988 pending confirmation in larger trials this multifactorial alternative approach to lipid lowering has promise for a subset of patients unwilling or unable to take statins
8022989 in this study we wanted to determine whether or not resveratrol which imparts many of the same health benefits as caloric restriction in mice does so by inducing a physiology similar to dietary restriction
8022990 the data show that resveratrol does induce many similar pathways
8022991 this study informs us how frailty in mice can be delayed
8022992 this knowledge could help us translate preclinical benefits to humans
8022993 in most cases these are underprivileged individuals many of them unable to read or write who are pressured into including their children
8022994 the laboratory pays 8 000 for each child included in the study but none of that money remains in the province that lends the public facilities and the health personnel for the private research
8022995 only 12 have died throughout the country which is a very low figure if we compare it with the deaths produced by respiratory illnesses caused by the pneumococcal bacteria
8022996 because they cant experiment in europe or the united states they come to do it in third world countries
8022997 a lot of people want to leave the protocol but arent allowed they force them to continue under the threat that if they leave they wont receive any other vaccine
8022998 has extensive experience in conducting clinical studies worldwide including in latin america
8022999 since the beginning of the study compas is monitored by an independent data monitoring committee idmc to oversee the safety aspects of the study and to help ensure that the highest ethical safety and compliance standards are followed including informed consent
8023000 the compas study is designed to evaluate the protective efficacy against pneumonia and acute otitis media of a pediatric pneumococcal conjugate vaccine compared to active control vaccines
8023001 only 12 have died throughout the country which is a very low figure if we compare it with the deaths produced by respiratory illnesses caused by the pneumococcal bacteria
8023002 by comparison with the reality my story is as tame as a holiday postcard
8023003 since the beginning of the study compas is monitored by an independent data monitoring committee idmc to oversee the safety aspects of the study and to help ensure that the highest ethical safety and compliance standards are followed including informed consent
8023004 i have to believe that no one at gsk or any other ethical vaccine development company wants to see children die in a clincal study lets be realistic folks

8023020 were just looking at ways to be more efficient and thats why i used the term public private partnerships trying to find some creative solutions
8023021 the reason im avoiding taxes is because i think taxes are addictive
8023022 economic conditions are tough and are going to be very harsh on the performance of state budgets in 2008 and 2009
8023023 states are looking for long term solutions in running businesses a public private partnership is a tool in their toolboxes
8023024 weve seen an unprecedented number of headhunters recruiting for positions on the buy and sell sides
8023025 were very committed to this space our business activity has increased dramatically even this year
8023026 the argument for a public private partnership is the private sector is a lot smarter about paying attention to costs and because it has skin in the game will be more attentive to maintaining an asset over its life
8023027 elected officials often shortchange funding of maintenance because they dont want to increase user fees or taxes to pay for it
8023028 their election cycle is four years they can pass it on to someone elses watch
8023029 lotteries have infrastructure characteristics in that they have stable cash flows and high barriers to entry
8023030 they could even attract private equity investment because they are self financeable and require minimal capital expenses

8023047 we have shown for the first time that diabetes adversely influences male fertility at a molecular level
8023048 but when we looked for dna damage we saw a very different picture
8023049 sperm rna was significantly altered and many of the changes we observed are in rna transcripts involved in dna repair and comparison with a database of men of proven fertility confirmed our findings diabetics have a significant decrease in their ability to repair sperm dna and once this is damaged it cannot be restored
8023050 we were particularly interested to see a fourteen fold decrease in the expression of a protein called ornithine decarboxylase which is responsible for the production of spermine and spermidine compounds responsible for cell growth that help stabilise the structure of dna we also found that spermatogenesis 20 a factor unique to the testis and whose function remains unknown was greatly increased taken together these factors indicate clearly that having diabetes has a direct influence on the health of semen
8023051 we found a class of compounds known as advanced glycation end products ages in the male reproductive tract these are formed as the result of glycation the addition of sugar
8023052 and accumulate during normal ageing they are dependent on life style diet smoking etc and in many diabetic complications are centrally implicated in dna damage we believe that they play a similar role in the male reproductive system
8023053 we must now try to develop strategies to protect sperm and to diminish the accumulation of ages
8023054 finally there is spermatogenesis 20 what does it do how does it do it under what circumstances and why why is it so greatly increased in diabetics we need to find answers to all these questions
8023055 let me find out whats going on and ill call you right back

8023067 the pattern of dysregulation was similar in the prefrontal cortex for both illnesses and pointed to key processes part of the set of core genes could be explained by medication responses however most of these core genes did not appear to be correlated to medication response
8023068 the new findings by drs shao and vawter provide evidence that there are a large number of genes that show a similar pattern of abnormal regulation in their sample of post mortem brain tissue from individuals who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder this overlap could provide insight into the neurobiology of both disorders
8023069 we have traditionally treated these diagnoses as unrelated conditions even though many of the same medications such as antipsychotic medications are used to treat both conditions

8023076 from other research we know between 15 and 20 per cent of people diagnosed with osa wont accept treatment at all of those who start treatment up to 50 per cent dont use it enough that is right through the night or they give up using it
8023077 surprisingly people with the most serious disease arent any more likely to stick to the treatment
8023078 we found a persons beliefs about the treatments effectiveness their confidence in sticking to the treatment and their understanding of the conditions health risks were more important than the severity of the disease
8023079 a person with osa might fall asleep during the day but if they arent working or dont drive much this might not worry them enough to seek treatment or stick to treatment
8023080 but if a spouse or family members pressure them to do something about the loud stop start snoring that accompanies osa which is keeping them awake the sufferer is more likely to do something about it
8023081 after they have seen the doctor and been offered treatment psychological factors including the threat to important relationships are what motivates them into complying with treatment
8023082 the scorecard tells us that we are losing ground in crucial areas like access to health care
8023083 we now have 75 million americans who are uninsured or underinsured poor access pulls down quality and drives up costs of care the u s leads the world on health care spending we should expect a far better return on our investment
8023084 its apparent that overall the health care system is performing unevenly and well below its potential
8023085 while there are pockets of improvement and excellence it is clear that we need strong leadership and concerted public and private efforts to achieve and raise standards of performance nationwide and ensure that significant progress occurs in the future
8023086 it will take serious public engagement and bold action in 2009 to give americans the health care system they deserve
8023087 we need to change direction and come together to support policies that aim to improve access quality and efficiency with the upcoming elections there is a window of opportunity to transform our health system to one that gives everyone the chance to live longer healthier and more productive lives
8023088 this is the first time that cardiovascular risk factors have been fully studied in the masai
8023089 bearing in mind the vast amount of walking they do it no longer seems strange that the masai have low waist measurements and good blood lipid profiles despite the levels of animal fat in their food
8023090 the most serious crime ever committed in american history knowingly and deliberately taking this country to war in iraq under false pretenses
8023091 could bring a murder charge against bush for any soldiers from that state who lost their lives fighting bushs war
8023092 bush and his gang of criminals were constantly telling americans that hussein constituted an imminent threat to the security of this country but they kept the truth from the american people that their cia was telling them the exact opposite that hussein and iraq were not an imminent threat to this country
8023093 the iraqi dictator must not be permitted to threaten america and the world with horrible poisons and diseases and gasses and atomic weapons
8023094 the cia did not consider hussein an imminent threat to this nation
8023095 every killing of an american soldier that took place during bushs war was an unlawful killing and murder
8023096 he did in fact specifically intend to have american soldiers killed
8023097 there certainly is more than enough evidence against bush to justify bringing him to trial and letting an american jury decide whether or not he is guilty of murder and if so what the appropriate punishment should be
8023098 vicarious liability rule of conspiracy which provides that each member of a conspiracy is criminally responsible for all crimes committed by his coconspirators or innocent agents of the conspirators to further the object of the conspiracy
8023099 is a grotesque anomaly and aberration no president has ever done what he did and it is not likely this nation will see a president do what bush did for centuries to come if ever at least we know that in the previous three centuries there was no one like this monstrous individual
8023100 to consult with any prosecutor who decides to prosecute bush in the preparation of additional cross examination questions for him to face on the witness stand
8023101 spying on americans without warrants or judicial approval is an abuse of government power and thats exactly what this law allows the aclu will not sit by and let this evisceration of the fourth amendment go unchallenged
8023102 electronic surveillance must be conducted in a constitutional manner that affords the greatest possible protection for individual privacy and free speech rights the new wiretapping law fails to provide fundamental safeguards that the constitution unambiguously requires
8023103 as a journalist my job requires communication with people in all parts of the world from iraq to argentina if the u s government is given unchecked surveillance power to monitor reporters confidential sources my ability to do this work will be seriously compromised
8023104 i cannot in good conscience accept that my conversations with people who live outside the u s will put them in harms way as a result of overzealous government spying privacy in my communications is not simply an expectation its a right
8023105 the new law allows the mass acquisition of americans international e mails and telephone calls
8023106 the administration has argued that the law is necessary to address the threat of terrorism but the truth is that the law sweeps much more broadly and implicates all kinds of communications that have nothing to do with terrorism or criminal activity of any kind
8023107 a democratic system depends on the rule of law and not even the president or congress can authorize a law that violates core constitutional principles
8023108 the only thing compromised in this so called compromise law is the constitution
8023109 he felt he had no choice as an american citizen but to come forward and he also knows the likely consequences of him doing so
8023110 humanity in many parts of the world needs a wake up call to fully appreciate the vital environmental social and economic services wetlands provide absorbing and holding carbon moderating water levels supporting biodiversity and countless others
8023111 too often in the past people have unwittingly considered wetlands to be problems in need of a solution yet wetlands are essential to the planets health and with hindsight the problems in reality have turned out to be the draining of wetlands and other solutions we humans devised
8023112 this landmark conference beside the pantanal will gather an overview of the status of global wetlands identify knowledge gaps create greater collaboration and consistency in wetland science worldwide and offer a plain spoken policy prescription for decision makers with an appeal to adopt it with urgency
8023113 lessening the stress on wetlands caused by pollution and other human assaults will improve their resiliency and represents an important climate change adaptation strategy
8023114 wetland rehabilitation meanwhile represents a viable alternative to artificial flood control and dredging efforts that may be needed to cope with the larger more frequent floods predicted in a hotter world
8023115 wetlands act as sponges and their role as sources reservoirs and regulators of water is largely underappreciated by many farmers and others who rely on steady water supplies
8023116 they also cleanse water of organic pollutants prevent downstream flood inundations protect riverbanks and seashores from erosion recycle nutrients and capture sediment
8023117 detention treatment and trial of certain non citizens in the war against terrorism
8023118 determined that an extraordinary emergency exists for national defense purposes that this emergency constitutes an urgent and compelling government interest and that issuance of this order is necessary to meet the emergency
8023119 possible habeas jurisdiction over aliens held in guantanamo bay cuba
8023120 this quasi category created a universe of legal nihilism where human beings including us citizens can be disappeared detained incommunicado denied access to attorneys and regular courts tried by kangaroo courts executed tortured assassinated and subjected to numerous other manifestations of state terrorism
8023121 international treaties and federal laws on the treatment of individuals detained by the us armed forces in afghanistan the laws of armed conflict dont apply to the conditions of detention and the procedures for trial of members of al queda and the taliban militia
8023122 do not protect members of the al queda organization or the taliban militia
8023123 are not entitled to prisoner of war status for purposes of the geneva conventions of 1949
8023124 application of treaties and laws to al queda and taliban detainees
8023125 none of the provisions of geneva apply to our conflict with al qaida or taliban detainees in afghanistan or elsewhere throughout the world
8023126 it meant theyd be afforded no protection under international law and could be treated any way authorities wished including use of torture as was later learned
8023127 military interrogation of alien unlawful combatants held outside the united states
8023128 enjoys complete discretion in the exercise of his authority in conducting operations against hostile forces
8023129 a monument to executive supremacy and the imperial presidency and a road map for the pentagon to avoid any prosecutions
8023130 unusual lack of care and sobriety in its legal analysis and it seemed more an exercise of sheer power than reasoned analysis
8023131 serious physical injury so severe that death organ failure loss of significant body functions or permanent damage
8023132 interpretation of the geneva conventions common article 3 as applied to a program of detention and interrogation operated by the central intelligence agency
8023133 a member or part of or supporting al qaeda the taliban or associated organizations who might have information that could assist in detecting mitigating or preventing terrorist attacks within the united states or against its armed forces or other personnel citizens or facilities or against allies or other countries cooperating in the war on terror
8023134 so small that he had to double up his limbs in the fetal position
8023135 alternately in suffocating heat and in a painfully cold room
8023136 bright lights and eardrum shattering sounds 24 hours a day
8023137 have an ongoing confidential dialogue with members of the us intelligence community and we would share any observations or recommendations with them
8023138 warned that the abuse at torture prisons constituted war crimes placing the highest officials in the us government in jeopardy of being prosecuted
8023139 members of armed forces who laid down their arms shall in all circumstances be treated humanely
8023140 without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees
8023141 fails to make clear whether cia authorized interrogation techniques are still permitted
8023142 as authorization to continue using techniques such as waterboarding stress positions hypothermia sensory deprivation and overload sleep deprivation and isolation it sends a powerful and dangerous message
8023143 the dark side the inside story of how the war on terror turned into a war on american ideals
8023144 the dark side is a dramatic riveting and definitive narrative account of how the united states made terrible decisions in the pursuit of terrorists around the world decisions that not only violated the constitution to which white house officials took an oath to uphold but also hampered the pursuit of al queda in gripping detail jane mayer relates the impact of these decisions us held prisoners some of them completely innocent were subjected to treatment more reminiscent of the spanish inquisition than the twenty first century
8023145 torture the official law of the land in all but name
8023146 hard line law and order stalwarts in the criminal justice system
8023147 error prone legal decisions whose preordained conclusions were dictated by addington
8023148 to override existing laws that congress had specifically designated to curb him
8023149 a course not only for our international response but also in our domestic constitutional relations
8023150 which tend to be suppressed because of the social and psychological costs of not doing so
8023151 not just about what was legal but what was moral ethical right and smart to do
8023152 fundamentally the drive for expanded presidential authority was about unlimited power
8023153 a deadly interrogation can the cia legally kill a prisoner
8023154 yet swanner wasnt charged and continued to work for the agency
8023155 fashioned secret legal guidelines that appear to indemnify cia officials who perform aggressive even violent interrogations outside the united states
8023156 its going to be vital to use any means at our disposal
8023157 the black sites a rare look inside the cias secret interrogation program
8023158 for decades governments allowed their officials access to detainees to insure that proper treatment was being maintained
8023159 tantamount to torture and responsible american officials could have committed serious crimes
8023160 if the full story of the cia program ever surfaced agency personnel could face criminal prosecution
8023161 at every stage there was a rigid attention to detail it was almost automated people were utterly dehumanized they fell apart it was the intentional and systematic infliction of great suffering masquerading as a legal process it is just chilling
8023162 were not going to kill you but were going to take you to the brink of your death and back
8023163 black masked commandos attached to the cias paramilitary special activities division
8023164 taken to their cells by strong people in black outfits masks that covered their whole faces and dark visors over their eyes
8023165 hog tied stripped naked photographed hooded sedated with anal suppositories amounting to sodomy placed in diapers and transported by plane to a secret location
8023166 tear clothing from them by firmly pulling downward against buttons and seams pulling detainees off balance
8023167 hear people knocking their heads against walls and doors screaming their heads off
8023168 im not interested in unfair justice even for bad people danny was such a person of conscience i dont think he would have wanted all of this dirty business i dont think he would have wanted someone being tortured he would have been repulsed
8023169 saw to it that some of the sharpest and best trained lawyers in the country working in secret in the white house and us department of justice came up with legal justifications for a vast expansion of the governments power in waging war on terror as part of the process for the first time in history the united states sanctioned government officials to physically and psychologically torment us held captives making torture the official law of the land in all but name
8023170 extralegal counterterrorism program presented the most dramatic sustained and radical challenge to the rule of law in american history
8023171 is like a graveyard where you place a dead person in a tomb
8023172 she behaved in an improper way she came very close with her whole body towards me
8023173 clearly at odds with the most basic norms of fair trial and due process
8023174 the president can pick up any person in the country citizen or legal resident and lock them up for years without the most basic safeguard in the constitution the right to a fair and speedy criminal trial
8023175 that evidence derived through waterboarding was off limits that should still be our policy to do otherwise is not only an affront to american justice it will potentially put prosecutors at risk for using illegally obtained evidence
8023176 unfortunately i was overruled and i resigned my position to call attention to the issue efforts that were hampered by my being placed under a gag rule and ordered not to testify at a senate hearing while some high level military and civilian officials have rightly expressed indignation on the issue the current state can be described generally as indifference and inaction military justice has a proud history this was not one of its finer moments
8023177 after trials we can truthfully call full fair and open in that service we must declare that evidence obtained by waterboarding be banned in every american system of justice
8023178 the us administration chooses ships to try to keep their misconduct as far as possible from the prying eyes of the media and lawyers we will eventually reunite these ghost prisoners with their human rights
8023179 by its own admission the us government is currently detaining at least 26 000 people without trial in secret prisons and information suggests up to 80 000 have been through the system since 2001 the us government must show a commitment to rights and basic humanity by immediately revealing who these people are where they are and what has been done to them
8023180 for the majority of private individuals the intolerable became tolerable
8023181 this administrations approach to security unfair out of control a waste of resources treating the rights of the innocent as an afterthought
8023182 our research to understand this mechanism might provide a greater appreciation for how one could intervene to possibly slow macular degeneration
8023183 its fairly safe to say that if you inhibit this transporter you inhibit the uptake of xanthophylls so that certainly suggests that this transporter is involved in that process
8023184 children are the most vulnerable to the long lasting health effects of lead exposure
8023185 they are in urgent need of a safe effective heavy metal chelating agent to overcome the heavy metals and lead exposure challenges they face this study confirms that there is a safe option for them that will help promote their good health
8023186 it is a neck and neck race between 2007 and this year over the issue of ice loss
8023187 we thought arctic ice cover might recover after last years unprecedented melting and indeed the picture didnt look too bad last month cover was significantly below normal but at least it was up on last year
8023188 but the beaufort sea storms triggered steep ice losses and it now looks as if it will be a very close call indeed whether 2007 or 2008 is the worst year on record for ice cover over the arctic we will only find out when the cover reaches its minimum in mid september
8023189 how to win friends and influence people for the 21st century

8023194 i have the no 3 pick but i really want brady is that too early
8023195 we are thrilled that the jury sent a strong message that they want these companies to compete in the market place and not in the courtroom
8023196 the road commission just recently came in and fixed the corners and put corners and curb cuts in and didnt make two of the four corners of this intersection accessible to anyone in a wheelchair
8023197 its not very safe i dont think im sure there are people that have honked their horns at me and its quite inconvenient compared to crossing at the corner but theres no way to cross at the corner
8023198 you can run a circle around the intersection but you can really go anywhere
8023199 our federal aid which was widening south airport road from garfield to townline within that project the requirement came up that we either removed the pedestrian crossing signals or add ramps there was never any plans for extensive sidewalk improvements
8023200 what frustrates me is that they came in and they did something but didnt do anything that was of any benefit to anyone with a disability
8023201 we want the intersection to lead to cherryland mall at this time the construction doesnt make any sense
8023202 it seemed to me a very simple fix while youre doing it just add a sidewalk that makes the whole cherryland shopping center accessible
8023203 i live in a community theres a lot of agricultural stuff a lot of corn fields hay fields soy bean fields and stuff that most of the deer come and eat anyways and we hunt around that anyways so i dont see it negatively impacting us too much
8023204 at eight oclock the dnr showed up at my door with a quarantine that we cant bring any deer in or out dead or alive
8023205 we move fawns in the spring to people who want to bottle raise fawns we move dos in september and october that are open not bred and then we deliver dos in december that are bred to particular bucks we have here on the farm
8023206 although it was a lot of patients all al once this is certainly something were trained to deal with
8023207 we have procedures in place to make sure we have adequate resources
8023208 we were able to call on resources from ems our intensive care unit we had medical social work here our risk management department we were able to pull aides from other units
8023209 if were overloaded with medical patients we have a whole staff that will come in and help us out
8023210 for our most critical trauma patients we try to have at least two rns per patient in addition to that theyll be an er physician in the room a trauma surgeon and a pharmacist
8023211 oh the plans were going around there lots of planes
8023212 i think we mailed a letter every day that we could
8023213 they said dad you got a box today and i said oh its just a box and i hadnt even looked at it then
8023214 people cant tell you why either but i know there is a reason and im sure that what goes around comes around
8023215 i am not a closet muslim a black nationalist radical

8023223 john mccain lets face it hes got a compelling biography
8023224 john mccain is a man who is a genuine american hero and has served his country with distinction
8023225 i may be a multimillionaire but im not as rich and successful as john mccain
8023226 they want to see if there is any interest there
8023227 as i know it he is probably on a beach somewhere sipping on some pina coladas so i doubt football is the first thing on his mind today
8023228 no foolish curse can affect a man who has a double barreled shotgun as a throwing arm
8023229 hes a legend hes not old hes just older and hes not in a wheelchair yet
8023230 its just a cover of a video game and hes in a packers jersey
8023231 the studio knew the trucks were not safe there had even been an internal memo about the railings a new letter has been sent to tom cruise paula wagner and united artists in which we set out the facts of the case again and put a figure on the legal demands of our clients of 11 million
8023232 its been intense and were very excited to get back on the air and get back out there
8023233 when youre working on it and youre on the inside of it you dont find yourself getting caught up in the buzz
8023234 but were aware of it and its fantastic and it makes us feel our work is a success
8023235 theres new characters that are going to be introduced and there will be twists and turns and all the usual love triangles
8023236 and i think the issues and things that we touched on in season one will be explored more
8023237 personally my character has more of an adventure and more of an exploration of his motivations and why he is the way he is
8023238 basically we left off in season one with chuck making the decision not to pursue blair and i think he spent the summer contemplating that
8023239 when we come back in season two we see how he is with his decision
8023240 chad pennington said he has no hard feelings towards the jets or the fans and the most difficult part of his near midnight release by the jets on wednesday was the realization that he was no longer wanted after eight seasons and seven months of preparing for a quarterback battle with kellen clemens
8023241 i think the most difficult part of the last 24 hours is coming to the realization that youre no longer wanted by the organization said pennington
8023242 youve been there eight years and in a blink of the eye youre not wanted but i have an inner peace about it i feel good about how i was playing and conducting myself
8023243 the organization had different thoughts of course you wish it happened earlier but thats the most difficult part dealing with the suddenness it appears the organization didnt feel i was the quarterback to lead them where they wanted to go thats fine thats part of being in the business thats why you cant take it personal
8023244 with home heating costs set to soar this winter local residents must be able to shop around for the most affordable heating oil prices they should not worry about companies automatically renewing their contracts behind their backs

8023249 the surgery went well the knee looked good the prognosis is very very optimistic for a full recovery
8023250 medically we feel that he will be much stronger and better with some more time
8023251 that would be something that the doctor would have to have a great deal of input on because there wouldnt be sense in going that long and then not having him fully ready to go
8023252 i havent really talked to anyone at this point in time about anything
8023253 i am sure that general manager jerry reese and i and ownership will look long and hard at whatever options are out there and do what is best here at this point in time
8023254 i talked with kiwanuka and he was more than ready to do whatever we wanted him to do that was in the best interest of the team
8023255 obviously this isnt the way you want it to happen but it is an opportunity for a lot of guys and i am one of the guys that has to step up and take advantage of it
8023256 i was told all along that if something were to happen that this is a position i could find myself in i am ready to step in there and hopefully there wont be a letdown at all and we just have to get on it and keep the ball moving
8023257 my office continues to be concerned about the increasingly widespread practice in which alleged defaulted accounts mostly credit card debts are sold to debt purchasers for pennies on the dollar years after the default and when proof of the debt may no longer exist
8023258 my office will also continue to monitor this industry to ensure that such debt purchasers are licensed and do not abuse consumers notwithstanding our concerns about this industry i commend these companies for agreeing to conform their practices to west virginia law and for granting important relief to west virginia consumers

8023275 its particularly encouraging to note that where we found inadequate provision in previous inspections these settings have improved significantly
8023276 however there is still more to do to ensure that outcomes for all children are of a consistently high standard and that every child has access to the same quality care particularly in areas where provision is generally poorer
8023277 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life

8023285 prophet muhammad pbuh would sometimes begin to fast continuously until we thought he would not stop fasting and sometimes he used to stop fasting until we thought he would never fast i never saw the messenger of allah pbuh fasting a complete month except the month of ramadan and i have never seen him fasting in a month more frequently than he did in sha ban
8023286 surely allah the possessor of blessings the exalted descends to the lowest heaven on the night of mid sha ban and forgives more people than the hairs on the sheep of the tribe of kalb

8023321 nadie desea una nueva guerra fr a con rusia estados unidos y rusia tienen numerosos intereses comunes y rusia tiene el potencial para convertirse en un socio esencial en el sistema internacional
8023322 pero las recientes decisiones de rusia no las decisiones estadounidenses o europeas amenazan este potencial y nos recuerdan que la paz y la seguridad en europa no pueden considerarse como ganadas

8023327 i am asking those of you who supported me i will be forever grateful to work as hard for barack obama
8023328 let us join together here let us remember what we were fighting for
8023329 we were not just fighting to elect a particular person president we were fighting to take our country back let us join hands we may have started out on different paths but we are on the same journey now that journey leads not just to the white house but to a better future for our families and children
8023330 when she said this is not about the candidate this about our country that touched me it will be hard for me not to vote now but it was her it was her she spoke to me not him
8023331 have got to understand obama and theyre not there yet
8023332 hillary is out there by herself but there is only so much she can do obama has to do the work its one thing to say i will vote for obama it is another to go out and work for him
8023333 the basic problem that we all face nowadays is how to handle vast amounts of information at a sensible rate
8023334 most members did not see the current stance of policy as particularly accommodative given that many households and businesses were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability due to the effects of financial market strains as well as macroeconomic risks although members generally anticipated that the next policy move would likely be a tightening the timing and extent of any change in policy stance would depend on evolving economic and financial developments and the implications for the outlook for economic growth and inflation

8023408 theres not an obvious sign that points to a runaway situation but thats not to say its not either
8023409 they come in a giant bag and look similar to saffron but with longer strands they have a very full bodied flavor with a hint of a bite good for rounding out a dish
8023410 i love the chipotle for its intense smokiness and heat i loved canned chipotle in adobo and i found this bag of golden morita chipotles in the kitchen at de santo which i steeped in sherry vinegar i sprinkled the flavored vinegar on all kinds of things
8023411 to cook with habaneros you have to cut them theyre hot as hell you want to extract the flavor but it comes with the heat sweetness balances them out i also use them for garnish theyre pretty
8023412 a purple green fresh they taste like a red pepper but a little spicy
8023413 very wrinkly when dried then they taste smoky but something like a raisin or apricot toast the dried peppers on a griddle then soak them in warm water until soft depending on their heat discard the seeds thats where a lot of the heat comes from and puree this freezes nicely
8023414 india has so many varieties of chili they start at 1 8 inch long and generally the degree of heat depends on their size the hottest ones being the smallest what in india is called desi mirch is here known as the thai chili pepper thin small green chilies that are extremely spicy
8023415 before i left for beijing i went to chicos and picked out my entire wardrobe for the trip

8023425 is often the last resort and is usually applied when no meaningful alternative can be offered to creditors
8023426 the normal boulevard of remortgaging to pay off unsecured debts has been severely narrowed and the reduction of mortgage products available is resulting in many to consider formal insolvency
8023427 the thing that i want to hear first is that she is satisfied on behalf of us and those who sent us that the platform reflects her policy priorities if that has been improved since she campaigned then that would be a good message
8023428 remind people of why barack obama is much better than john mccain for anyone who supported her
8023429 shes going to have to help people remember what the elections about it wasnt about hillary it was about policies
8023430 its about as dangerous as it can get when a mother sets up her own child for this
8023431 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8023432 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8023433 we are pleased that we were able to reach this agreement
8023434 following the world series the players will review the matter and then determine what course to take for the future while the use of instant replay is an experiment we hope that over the balance of this season it will prove to be a success
8023435 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now by doing things the way we did it
8023436 but when you look at the technology we now have and the new ballparks and even some of the old ballparks that have been reconfigured theres no question that it was a challenge to the umpires like anything else in life there are times when you need to make an adjustment
8023437 that would be wonderful if it worked because it would save him having this huge operation which in his condition he may not pull through
8023438 now an operation that would be quite successful for many people for a person in his weakened state it could probably be fatal
8023439 so the news is very good up to date and lets hope it continues that way
8023440 i do have support and ive got very good neighbours and lots of friends round about
8023441 we agree that you dont grow an economy by raising taxes we agree that you dont grow an economy by cutting off trade we agree that you dont grow an economy by saying were not going to drill of additional oil
8023442 if you go back and look at debates held youll find each of us describing our differences with one another and surely youll find where one or another of us disagreed with sen mccain on one issue or another
8023443 but youre never going to find someone saying john mccain wasnt qualified to be president of the united states
8023444 his experience has not provided for him the kind of judgment gravitas that is necessary to face the kind of challenges of world at large
8023445 i think he brings experience but if you look at joe bidens record with some 30 years in foreign policy experience theres about 30 years of generally being wrong on foreign policy issues
8023446 the feeling i get from many leafs fans is that they wanna see the leafs play just well enough to lose most nights this year you get yourself somebody to go along with luke schenn both those players begin to develop in the next few years you get yourself a solid foundation and youre on your way
8023447 right now i dont see the leafs wanting to plug too many holes with veteran players
8023448 you need one more year to get yourself in a primo drafting position and then again youve got a foundation and you can build around young players unequivocally that is the way to do it in the post lockout nhl you cant plug holes teams have tried to do it the leafs the phoenix coyotes tried to do it theyve started now to bring along some young players peter mueller is gonna be a very good player he started last season kyle turris is coming up dan carcillo is one of the premiere s disturbers in the game and he can score a little bit theyve got some good young players daniel winnik on that team theyre gonna move forward thats the way you move forward in the nhl youve gotta move forward with youth youve gotta get every time you get a front line or a player that has the possibility of mid or front line status playing at the entry level contract area 850 000 a year plus some i guess bonus money or whatever you wanna call it thats just extra youre getting a guy playing for virtually peanuts who could be your best player very quickly thats the way to do it
8023449 the chicago blackhawks are a good example right now with patrick kane and jonathan toews i mean theyre a little bit lucky there to get two players of that caliber in the same year but you see how a laughing stock like the blackhawks was turned into a very good team in the span of one short yea r
8023450 the feeling i get from many leafs fans is that they
8023451 the maple leafs are perennially and justifiably measured against the franchises last stanley cup winner in 1967 and there are precious can mark bell regain his form
8023452 these missiles are close to our borders and constitute a threat to us
8023453 this will create additional tension and we will have to respond to it in some way naturally using military means
8023454 it is nice to slow down and actually see the surroundings
8023455 we trained very hard but it seemed that every time we were beginning to form up into teams we would be reorganised i was to learn later in life that we tend to meet any new situation by reorganising it can be a wonderful method of creating the illusion of progress while creating confusion inefficiency and demoralisation
8023456 s he stands a rather good chance of becoming a supreme court justice
8023457 a very good 62 year old liberal would be in a position to not only help out the country in ways a president couldnt and for possibly 15 to 20 more years but it would make the republicans gnaw their own legs off
8023458 al qaida told their families they had been arrested but the fact is they were buried here piled one on top of the other just like bricks
8023459 they will find others many families have already come here to look for their missing sons and daughters
8023460 i deliberately havent put a picture of my brother up in the house and whenever i find a picture of his i hide it because my mother and i dont know what happened to him
8023461 he is not a dead person yet he is not a living person either
8023462 there are different charities that help look for missing people
8023463 weve been to them all but they havent found anything about my brother weve tried everything possible
8023464 i have some families they have six seven members of their families kidnapped in one vehicle
8023465 they have no information where are they it is a terrible tragedy
8023466 it is a lot it is a lot it is a lot
8023467 and there is huge locations in different places until now we have information about where but we do not want to go
8023468 i know his face and from his face i will be able to identify him
8023469 three months ago people came to me and said that they saw him in the city
8023470 he was limping dirty and badly dressed maybe it was someone else who looked like him but maybe it was him i have hope that he is alive
8023471 shes going to thank her supporters and then most importantly she is going to tell her supporters we all have to come together to support barack obama
8023472 she is going to fire em up and she is going to draw some distinctions too and she is going to talk about what john mccain will mean for this country and how we cant allow him to be president

8023483 we expect russia to live up to its international commitments reconsider this irresponsible decision and follow the approach set out in the six point ceasefire agreement
8023484 in accordance with united nations security council resolutions that remain in force abkhazia and south ossetia are within the internationally recognised borders of georgia and they must remain so
8023485 and therefore in accordance with other security council resolutions that are still in force abkhazia and south ossetia are a part of the internationally recognised borders of georgia and its going to remain so
8023486 todays announcement by president medvedev that russia will recognise south ossetia and abkhazia is unjustifiable and unacceptable
8023487 i am holding talks today with international partners and will be visiting ukraine tomorrow to ensure the widest possible coalition against russian aggression in georgia
8023488 this contradicts principles of territorial integrity as a fundamental right
8023489 it calls for a political solution to the conflicts in georgia it will examine the consequences of russias decision from this point of view

8023506 but traffic congestion doesnt all of a sudden go from bad to good when you cross any particular city or county border and air quality and climate challenges dont respect artificial boundaries
8023507 most people dont want to live in dense urban cores
8023508 they want a little grass a little garden a little breathing room they can call their own and who the hell are you to tell people they cant
8023509 its either going to be some regulation restricting your behavior or some huge tax and neither of those is politically popular
8023510 so theres been a big debate about whether we can do this all with carrots
8023511 ive spent most of my 30 year career fighting regional planning and regional government
8023512 but what you are seeing here is a pretty thoughtful approach there are incentives for in fill development and building along transportation corridors and in the end it doesnt prevent development in suburban areas it just says there are standards and it has to be done well
8023513 in order to have affordable housing you shouldnt have to live in tracy if you work in san jose
8023514 you should have a range of housing and transportation options

8023569 although members generally anticipated that the next policy move would likely be a tightening the timing and extent of any change in policy stance would depend on evolving economic and financial developments and the implications for the outlook for economic growth and inflation
8023570 heldhaftige mensen zijn dikwijls mensen met een gebrek aan voorstellingsvermogen
8023571 mijn dochter werd verkracht in het zuidstation in brussel de hoofdstad van europa en volslagen straffeloos
8023572 mijn dochter kwam terug van waterloo negen uur in de avond toen ze de trein uitstapte ging ze naar bancontact een plek waar volk voorbijkomt nochtans is het daar dat het drama is gebeurd
8023573 twee man hebben haar verweten dat ze geen hoofddoek droeg mijn dochter is mooi ze is blond met blauwe ogen
8023574 e n van de aanvallers haalde een mes tevoorschijn mijn dochter werd tegen de wand van de bancontact gedrukt met het mes op haar keel werd ze door n van de kerels verkracht de andere keek toe
8023575 er passeerden mensen mijn dochter weet zeker dat ze minstens drie mensen heeft gezien geen van hen maakte halt om haar te redden
8023576 het waren twee noord afrikanen ze hadden zich niet eens vermomd en vertel mij niet dat ik een racist ben als ik je vertel waar ze vandaan kwamen mijn dochter werd verkracht omdat zij geen hoofddoek droeg zo is dat
8023577 moet ik je vertellen in wat voor toestand zij was
8023578 de mensen van de politie waren zeer professioneel op de kleren werd beslag gelegd en er werden dna stalen genomen
8023579 in de nasleep van de dood van joe van holsbeeck heeft men bij hoog en laag uitgeroepen dat er in de stations meer veiligheid zou komen het bewijs is er nu met mijn dochter dat er niets is veranderd cameras op alle plekken in het zuidstation zijn er niet nochtans n van de drukste stations

8023590 were not going to be intimidated into voting for someone we dont think is qualified
8023591 i just needed to let it out im angry about what happened to hillary so many women my age thought it was our time
8023592 shes saying that shes going to vote for obama i had thought she wished everyone would vote for obama
8023593 hillary to her credit is really stepping up to the plate i have my heartache i have all the qualms about maybe i should have done this maybe i should have said that but its so important to win that we all have to do our part
8023594 i think well all come out incredible united because we are fortunate enough to have another great leader sen hillary clinton
8023595 we had our battle in the primary no one was more committed to sen clinton than me
8023596 people who support hillary clinton will get on board and be united to defeat sen john mccain and the republican party in november
8023597 im upset i dont like it and i dont approve of it and the republicans are going to lose in november
8023598 as an old political hand i can tell you it never works then the candidate the person used in the ads comes out and says theyre full of it and the real truth is boom and hillary will do that
8023599 hed like to put it behind him at this point it was a scary episode for the family
8023600 usually a flea that bites an infected animal a rodent a prairie dog a squirrel and then bites a human
8023601 the scout was not contagious it was caught in stage one there was no chance of someone else catching the disease from him
8023602 it was costing me approximately 120 a week in gas
8023603 the first rider i connected with was brian and that was through craigslist my second rider mike found him through erideshare com
8023604 when they see they are paying 80 to fill the tank of their car they really should feel like they have to do something
8023605 they have a way of kind of connecting and being comfortable with uh with their fellow riders
8023606 the experience has been great i found someone who lives really close to me and we really hit it off well
8023607 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8023608 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8023609 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8023610 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8023611 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8023612 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8023613 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8023614 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8023615 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8023616 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play
8023617 the terrorists would not have been able to act in this way without the financial support given to them
8023618 many things have become available to us but they need to be completed and this is what we are doing in the end we hope it will not be long before we inform the public of all these facts

8023646 es el partido de mayor transcendencia desde que estoy aqu
8023647 sin lugar a dudas es el partido m s importante desde que estoy aqu hace dos a os lleg en el verano de 2006 para m y para los jugadores es el de mayor transcendencia hablaba con cerezo y dec amos lo mismo es el m s importante desde que es presidente
8023648 el ambiente que rodea al equipo la prensa las preguntas la afici n por la calle la familia misma est distinta aqu tengo gente que ha jugado champions mundiales uefa partidos internacionales muchos de ellos han jugado partidos como ste
8023649 si somos capaces de canalizar estas ganas de que empiece ya el partido esa energ a la canalizamos al terreno de juego la trasladamos all somos intensos y muy solidarios como equipo tenemos posibilidades
8023650 es importante cumplir un objetivo por el que fui contratado
8023651 el partido tiene una dificultad vamos perdiendo 1 0 hasta que no seamos capaces de igualar la contienda hasta ese momento es donde nos hemos preparado hemos estado trabajando m s en la tranquilidad que hay que tener en 90 minutos nos hace falta un gol para que empiece la eliminatoria nos hemos preparado para tratar de igualar la eliminatoria que hoy est desnivelada
8023652 habl con la plantilla y les dec a a los jugadores que la obligaci n era entregarse en el terreno de juego correr luchar y pelear por esta camiseta esa es la obligaci n y la transmiti el presidente pero no habl de resultados
8023653 todos los que estamos en el atl tico sabemos que es un jugador importante pero hasta l lo ha dicho un equipo lo formamos todos los 24 jugadores de la plantilla y kun es uno de ellos tiene unas caracter sticas especiales y distintas pero est claro que la labor del conjunto est por encima
8023654 pienso que la plantilla est consciente como yo de que es un jugador m s al que no le podemos meter m s presi n entiendo que la prensa y la gente est vida de ponerlo como el m ximo salvador kun y la plantilla son inteligentes y saben cada uno su parcela y qu trabajo tienen que hacer
8023655 va a estar muy motivado no es lo mismo venir con la medalla de oro que ser eliminado y venir vac o para el equipo nos da alegr a por l pero no es significativo tenemos que jugar con y sin el kun y jugar bien
8023656 es un hombre que le motiva mucho es su yerno pienso que motiva mucho a los argentinos y a los futbolistas todos los que vimos jugar a diego nos hace mucha ilusi n que est empujando al equipo desde el palco que sea un hincha m s

8023658 but we wouldnt expect any better because other than being a successful actor hes limited and when i mean limited i really do mean limited
8023659 i can see where the home secretary is coming from the home office but i think glitter as a popular craft product used by children shouldnt need to be banned providing they dont rename it paulgadd of course
8023660 i will concede that glitter starring maria carey and released in 2001 was a really crappy movie i can appreciate that
8023661 however i think it is up to the public whether they want to waste their money on seeing it or not its not as if they are going to enter the cinema and find their 12 year old child gets fondled by an ageing former pop star not even gary glitter would be perveted enough to sit through glitter besides think of all the sales of overly expensive popcorn that could be lost because these two dreadful things one a popstar the other a movie share the same name im not too sure about this at all
8023662 come on home secretary what are ballrooms now going to call the round mirrored thing hanging from ceilings a ballroom ball for heavens sake
8023663 i know the glitter ball was named after the pop star because theyre both round fat and can even be turned on by children but i mean to say blimey

8023672 i want to make sure that we do two things tonight number one that we are unified as a delegation in cheering for hilary clinton and i know well do that cheer for her before she gets up to speak after she finishes and tomorrow the same thing for president clinton and of course on thursday for the next president of the united states who pennsylvania is going to put over the top i dont want to hear one discordant note
8023673 but thats not to say that there isnt some among a very small percentage some lingering hard feelings we have a few puma ites in our midst and we have a few obama people who are still ticked off at president clinton but i think we all know that to achieve our objective we need to be totally united
8023674 shes going to say to everybody and to millions of americans shes going to say to them what she said that saturday in washington
8023675 you didnt mention the other member of the clinton family
8023676 president clinton i dont know exactly what the presidents going to talk about but i think hell do a good job as well

8023685 the roster moves weve made are joe jurevicius going to pup kevin kasper going to ir and two young players we released brian schaefering and austin scott to go with damon jenkins we are at 75 where we need to be right now we have another cut down after the game and well get down to our 53 we are working towards that number and how some of them play in the game might impact that so these guys are going to go out and i think they will give a good effort particularly anyone who thinks they might be on the bubble da was out here for a little bit today so that was good for him to be back around the guys who are inside rehabbing they are still making progress and they are coming along we are making progress and hopefully monday we will have everybody back on the field so we can begin our preparation at that time for the dallas cowboys game

8023695 kita tidak boleh mengkafirkan seorang muslim dengan setiap dosa meskipun dosa besar kecuali ada unsur menganggap halal maksiat itu kita juga tidak menghilangkan akar iman darinya dia masih disebut orang beriman secara hakiki atau seorang mukmin yang fasik tetapi tidak kafir

8023711 these are human beings its our duty to protect the care for them
8023712 i think one of the things that was brought out in these papers is that maybe these warnings arent enough
8023713 maybe the warnings need to be complemented with other things like guidelines
8023714 the rates that those drugs looked like they were increasing was a little bit blunted
8023715 the warnings didnt have i would think the effect that people might have wanted to have seen on the way the drugs are being prescribed

8023841 according to international law the obligations of the member states of the united nations under the charter of the united nations prevail over any other obligation
8023842 where acting pursuant to chapter vii of the charter of the united nations the security council through its sanctions committee decides that the funds of certain individuals or entities must be frozen its decision is binding on the members of the united nations
8023843 acted under circumscribed powers with the result that they had no autonomous discretion in particular they could neither directly alter the content of the resolutions at issue nor set up any mechanism capable of giving rise to such alteration
8023844 any review of the internal lawfulness of the contested regulation would therefore imply that the court is to consider indirectly the lawfulness of those resolutions in that hypothetical situation in fact the origin of the illegality alleged by the applicant would have to be sought not in the adoption of the contested regulation but in the resolutions of the security council which imposed the sanctions
8023845 the resolutions of the security council at issue fall in principle outside the ambit of the courts judicial review and that the court has no authority to call in question even indirectly their lawfulness
8023846 empowered to check indirectly the lawfulness of the resolutions of the security council in question with regard to jus cogens understood as a body of higher rules of public international law binding on all subjects of international law including the bodies of the united nations and from which no derogation is possible
8023847 the applicants interest in having a court hear his case on its merits is not enough to outweigh the essential public interest in the maintenance of international peace and security in the face of a threat clearly identified by the security council

8023859 reluctance on the part of states to freeze tangible assets such as business or property

8023861 each country should also adopt and implement measures including legislative ones which would enable the competent authorities to seize and confiscate property that is the proceeds of or used in or intended or allocated for use in the financing of terrorism terrorist acts or terrorist organisations
8023862 those assets wholly or jointly owned or controlled directly or indirectly by designated persons
8023863 the freezing of funds financial assets and other economic resources of the persons identified by the security council as being associated with usama bin laden the al qaeda network and the taliban is not incompatible with the fundamental rights of the human person falling within the ambit of jus cogens in light of the public interest objective of fundamental importance to the international community which is to combat by all means in accordance with the charter of the united nations threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts

8024097 ojal los jugadores sepan manejar la presi n en estos d as hablamos mucho del partido pasado y del que viene sabemos que tenemos que conseguir el resultado y no tenemos que ser tan ingenuos pues al tener el partido 2 0 lo tienes que ganar
8024098 s como manejar al grupo y le vamos a dar m xima confianza para que pueda rendir y eso es lo que queremos nosotros
8024099 mientras est s en los equipos grandes habr presi n jugar bien es lo que queremos esa es siempre mi mentalidad tratar de ganar y seguro vamos a hacerlo
8024100 tenemos buenos jugadores pero cometimos errores y eso lo vamos a mejorar el plantel sabe de esa responsabilidad que tenemos de jugar bien y ganar los puntos y es lo que vamos a buscar

8024112 me gustar a que en los tres pr ximos meses se saquen las consecuencias y que a comienzos de 2009
8024113 me habr a parecido muy cobarde enviar al equipo de francia all y no ir
8024114 ser un partido dif cil estamos recuper ndonos y tenemos que traer un buen resultado
8024115 s lo puedo agradecer a la directiva del sport por entender mi situaci n el traspaso es bueno para las dos partes y me deja muy feliz por irme de aqu y dejar un dinero en el club
8024116 si tuvi ramos tres o cuatro negociaciones como esta por a o se garantizar an las finanzas del equipo esta es la mejor manera de que el club haga caja vendiendo jugadores
8024117 por esto vamos a invertir en unas instalaciones deportivas para que el club fabrique sus propios jugadores porque vivir de los fichajes es muy caro
8024118 boca juniors no va a poder contar con siete jugadores y por eso es que pedimos la reprogramaci n del partido con newells
8024119 es hora de que oscar c rdoba sea el n mero uno del equipo
8024120 yo estaba esperando a que oscar c rdoba se adaptara a todo lo que es millonarios l ven a de una peque a para entonces se fue preparando y cuando yo consider necesario lo puse en el arco porque yo no puedo esperar a que jos cuadrado haga un mal partido para cambiarlo
8024121 a c rdoba lo trajimos ac por todo lo que significa por su historia en el f tbol por lo que es y tiene que ser el n mero uno debe tener la responsabilidad y yo pienso que est preparado para hacerlo ya trabaj ya se adapt y est listo aunque jos cuadrado se gan un espacio una gran confianza e igual debemos confiar en lo que hace
8024122 me parece espantoso lo que sucedi nunca me meto con los rbitros pero esta vez le dije que me iba a quejar ellos pueden cometer errores pero cuando existe la posibilidad reglamentaria de apoyarte en tus asistentes y tienes la oportunidad de corregir un error debes hacerlo de lo contrario se te empieza a ocurrir que es adrede lo que hizo
8024123 el l nea abraham gonz lez le dijo que la falta que ni siquiera existi hab a sido afuera pero no le import y eso me molest
8024124 pienso que es una etapa de transici n dentro del torneo ojal siempre pudi ramos estar arriba nosotros sabemos que trabajamos en una profesi n que est llena de presiones y que estamos en un equipo como millonarios con una historia excelente por eso pretendemos trabajar para ser campeones entonces no nos puede presionar el hecho de perder el primer lugar
8024125 el ma o es una persona que aprecio lo conozco desde hace mucho tiempo incluso hace muy poco hablamos por tel fono para preguntarle por un jugador manuel maciel al que l hab a tenido en la selecci n paraguaya durante el mundial del 2006
8024126 por ruiz tengo un gran respeto es un hombre que ha hecho cosas importantes y llegar a un pa s donde ya ha trabajado pero l gicamente tendr que tomarse el tiempo de adaptaci n
8024127 no fue f cil mi salto al profesionalismo me ofrecieron millones despu s de los juegos ol mpicos de atenas 2004 y a la hora de firmar el contrato no fue lo que esperaba
8024128 de amigo le recomiendo que espere si le dan un buen apoyo ojal siga en el equipo ol mpico hasta los juegos de londres 2012 pues si a mi me hubieran ayudado me quedaba
8024129 ten a que haberme quedado para competir en los juegos de pek n campeones mundiales hay muchos pero son pocos los medallistas ol mpicos
8024130 creo que m s all de ver si estamos jugando bien o mal de visitante hoy m s que nada importa ganar porque hemos dejado puntos en el camino puntos que parec a y se sent a que nos pod amos quedar con ellos y nos tienen con cinco puntos
8024131 algo le falta a rayados y tenemos que ganar c mo como sea
8024132 es un jugador importante que como todos los que han estado en monterrey y van a otros equipos buscan hacer lo que no hicieron ac va a ser importante marcarlo bien y estar concentrados
8024133 este es un chico que ya demostr lo que vale como futbolista y apostaremos decididamente por los juveniles
8024134 tratar de que no se note la ausencia de mart n
8024135 ecuador saldr por los seis puntos ante bolivia y uruguay
8024136 nosotros aspiramos ganar los seis puntos contra bolivia y uruguay vamos a ver si lo podemos lograr en base al trabajo que tenemos planificado realizar
8024137 personalmente estoy muy feliz sabiendo que esta convocatoria o la siguiente puede ser la ltima para m por lo que vivo este momento de una manera diferente
8024138 sue o con despedirme de la selecci n ecuatoriana en sud frica
8024139 esa es la idea lo he pensado lo vengo so ando visualizando porque ser a importante para m poder retirarme de la selecci n habiendo clasificado tres veces a un mundial espero que con la ayuda de dios m s el trabajo m o y la colaboraci n de mis compa eros se pueda cumplir ese sue o para quedar realmente satisfecho
8024140 ahora es muy prematuro hablar de una clasificaci n a sud frica aunque trabajaremos para conseguirla va a ser dura porque la eliminatoria se est tornando muy complicada m s que las dos anteriores donde pudimos asistir a los mundiales de corea y jap n y alemania
8024141 lo que pasa es que se est n resignando muchos puntos con selecciones que anteriormente era dif cil que te quitaran un punto y ahora lo est n haciendo adem s hay selecciones que van y ganan de visitante y luego de local pierden entonces eso habla de que es una competencia muy exigente con partidos muy re idos y no hay cupo para todas
8024142 ecuador depende hoy por hoy de lo que hagamos nosotros para poder estar en sud frica y vamos a trabajar para ello tenemos ahora dos partidos importantes frente a bolivia en quito donde esperamos conseguir los tres puntos para despu s pensar en uruguay que es un rival complicado tambi n
8024143 estoy acostumbr ndome al entorno de millonarios al horario al clima de bogot y la verdad las cosas est n saliendo bien adem s con el profesor quintabani desde que trabajamos en atl tico nacional hay una buena relaci n no solo de t cnico a jugador sino de amistad hay confianza mutua y eso para cualquiera es muy importante
8024144 la idea con el equipo es seguir trabajando seguir con el objetivo firme de poder conseguir la mayor cantidad de puntos para estar entre los ocho mejores del f tbol colombiano y posteriormente aspirar al t tulo
8024145 el equipo va por muy buen camino individualmente se est rindiendo a un nivel importante y eso me permite estar trabajando de la mejor forma y con mucha confianza
8024146 this is what insane asylums back in 1934 looked like
8024147 i spent five and a half years in a prison cell i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair
8024148 beginning to understand that others have feelings and needs too
8024149 no creo que hoy haya habido un paso atr s en nuestra preparaci n igual no hemos estado tan precisos pero hay un contrario que tambi n juega y hemos tenido cinco o seis ocasiones de gol delante del portero hemos perdido pero hemos podido empatar e incluso ganar
8024150 un equipo muy organizado en el que se nota la mano del entrenador
8024151 ya doy por sentado que los campos de reci n ascendidos son complicad simos
8024152 no sab is lo content que estoy por la forma en la que nos hemos clasificado el barcelona gan en la ida por 4 0 porque he visto tantas eliminatorias de este tipo que se han acabado complicando
8024153 para no perder ni un partido m s en quito
8024154 mi sue o es pelear en el estadio azteca porque en ese escenario tuvo una hist rica funci n mi dolo julio c sar ch vez y por eso me gustar a combatir ah
8024155 el boxeo mexicano siempre ha sobresalido a nivel mundial y para m es un honor presentar funciones en este pa s cuna de grandes campeones mundiales
8024156 en el boxeo siempre habr cr tica por los pesos pero ser a bueno una pelea contra pacquiao ser a muy atractiva porque yo sub seis divisiones y roy jones se fue de medio hasta completo para ganarle a john ruiz
8024157 quiero una pelea grande de despedida para impactar a todo el mundo en un grandioso evento pero para el 6 de diciembre el azteca est ocupado para el futbol pero para m es un sue o pelear en ese escenario y no lo descarto en otra pelea para el pr ximo a o
8024158 el sistema de puntuaci n no funciona en las ol mpiadas porque les cambia el estilo a los peleadores que est n obligados a soltar golpes a lo loco para sumar puntos
8024159 despu s de esta funci n montaremos programas en guadalajara y me gustar a en durango porque de ah es mi familia paterna y con gusto iremos a ese estado
8024160 porque el pr ximo presidente debe ser sensitivo con muchos mexicanos que llegan en busca del sue o americano
8024161 es el partido m s importante desde que soy entrenador del atl tico de madrid para m y para mis jugadores es el partido de mayor trascendencia algo que coment con el presidente del club enrique cerezo que reconoci que tambi n para l era el de m s importancia desde que accedi al cargo
8024162 para m desde luego es importante dirigir al atl tico de madrid en la champions league porque fui contratado para ello
8024163 nos hemos preparado para afrontar un partido dif cil porque vamos 1 0 en contra hemos incidido en que debemos tener tranquilidad hasta conseguir el gol pues tenemos 90 minutos por delante para que empiece
8024164 la plantilla es consciente de que no le podemos meter m s presi n entiendo que la gente diga es el salvador pero el plantel es inteligente y sabe lo que tiene que hacer en cada momento

8024251 a terrible plague is upon us claiming victims every day these sinful devices were banned by all the great rabbis but are still common in the haredi world their devilish distributors want nothing more than to drive the people of israel to sin through movies and other abominations
8024252 this little device is the devils way to try and gain entrance to our protected homes and yeshivas disguised as something you can listen to torah lessons through
8024253 the zionazi police arrested yeshiva student shmuel weisfish for his alleged participation in activity aimed against those who pollute our camp such as the stores that sell profanity the safeguarding of the torah is considered a crime in this country of sodom and gomorrha the haredi sect will fight back against its accusers

8024268 the members of this cult who were more than twice her age were calling the shots
8024269 it fits the profile of a classic cult in the sense that its a personality driven group and that queen antoinette is that animating personality and central defining element of the group

8024272 i fear for my grandsons and my daughters safety you see they are in a cult i havent seen or heard from my daughter since april
8024273 its a tragic tragic situation and we responded with the information that we had in a responsive way and unfortunately it didnt change the outcome
8024274 they were coaching her and telling her what to say

8024280 thats not the right way to start deliberations in a trial that has lasted six or seven days
8024281 even courts that have admitted such evidence do so with the caveat that the remedial measures must have immediately followed the tortuous conduct
8024282 they made a choice not to ask the witness about it for good reason
8024283 pose an immediate and fundamental threat to the religions communal lifestyle and beliefs of the community because they threaten its self sufficiency and thus is contrary to law constitutional rights and the best interests of the people who live on trust property and rely on it for their sustenance
8024284 harm the community and its members in a way which cannot be compensated
8024285 we dont want the standard of having to get court approval for sales
8024286 shamelessly admit that their use of the property was at the direction of the flds priesthood leadership
8024287 legitimate business concerns not any practice of secrecy in connection with managing the trust

8024343 a different god mitt romney the religious right and the mormon question
8024344 when you get right down to it it was a slap in the face of utah republicans
8024345 i personally do not think romney is going to be selected by mccain but i may be pleasantly surprised mitt romney really is by far the best choice hopefully mccain says it is worth angering a few evangelicals
8024346 people didnt think a catholic could be president john f kennedy proved them wrong
8024347 i think mccain will see that romney would hurt him i would agree with foster on that there are a lot of strong feelings against mormons
8024348 but i dont know that they think we are a part of them
8024349 but if you are not mormon you are not allowed to say anything about the mean spiritedness of many mormons or you are called a bigot stereotyper etc hmmmmm as suggested to us craig maybe you and mitt should turn the other cheek

8024357 we are seeing a change where more kids seem to be looking at in state schools
8024358 maybe its an economic thing or just dont want to travel as much
8024359 more than ever they reflect the face of education in this country
8024360 were gratified to see that our country is moving increasingly toward being a nation of college graduates
8024361 its the easiest way to passively gain intelligence on the largest groups of society and nearly every walk of life
8024362 there is no such thing as privacy on the internet
8024363 you are only delaying the inevitable information leakage for any content you put online my recommendation is to treat the internet as if all content there lasts forever
8024364 youre only going to see these attacks on social networks go up
8024365 weve noticed some weird social networking attacks since we did our talk
8024366 the us is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in the dprk democratic peoples republic of korea as it pleases just as it did in iraq
8024367 we have decided to immediately suspend disabling our nuclear facilities

8024372 during our summers at camp we take a sixteen mile bike ride with a group of boys and another bike ride with a group of girls the two rides couldnt be more different the boys pedal with a sense of purpose they are trying to reach their destination as quickly as possible they might joke with each other a little along the way but mostly they are independently pushing themselves toward their goal the girls on the other hand meander we have a long slow enjoyable ride there are typically several clumps of girls deep in conversation about friendships or boys a mile or so up the road there is usually a group singing their favorite childhood songs at the top of their lungs the purpose of the girls ride is more in the relationships formed than the accomplishment of reaching the goal
8024373 i got a letter from the government i read it it said they were suckers
8024374 sometimes it takes all the running you can do just to stay in one place
8024375 well shoot im sure glad i came to work today
8024376 we need a place where people can have a discussion and get information
8024377 and people need to know that its not coming from an anti mormon place or a gay castro district place its coming from a faithful place
8024378 when i heard and saw the letter that the church leaders had read in sacrament meetings i was appalled
8024379 so i said thats it i want mormons to know that there are gay people in their congregations every sunday
8024380 i really just want people to try and understand and see the pain they are causing gay members of the church who are struggling
8024381 provide license to infringe or impose upon the rights and liberties of others
8024382 if there would have been a site like this it would have been really helpful
8024383 last time during prop 22 all i did was vote no this time i wanted to stand up and be heard even though its hard
8024384 there is a lot of anxiety and stress over being conflicted being an active mormon and being for gay marriage
8024385 thats part of the reason we wanted to do the site
8024386 if you think you are the only person in your ward that feels that way and the rhetoric is really loud its painful
8024387 the church of course recognizes and accepts that some among its very large membership may view the issue differently
8024388 ive never stumped before but i want to be a part of this
8024389 we are going to change the constitution and say on nov
8024390 were just polling yes or no not trying to find converts or change peoples minds
8024391 california should do more to encourage families to stay together
8024392 they want people to feel like you are a bad person if you support what has been the definition of marriage since the dawn of time
8024393 children in schools will be taught that same sex marriage is ok

8024396 they helped america to become more worthy of them and more true to its ideals
8024397 conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his own life
8024398 attending so many classes that the faculty acknowledging a wisdom and experience greater than their own honored themselves by making him a professor
8024399 with the sandor teszler award we seek to commemorate the life and career of sandor teszler who was for many years associated with wofford and who in his own life and career embodied the ideals of the award being made in his name
8024400 we also seek to celebrate the contributions of a figure of both national and international renown it is our intention to assure that everyone in the wofford college community is fully aware of the recipients achievement the faculty will process in full academic regalia and the honoree will address the college as the main speaker for this occasion
8024401 institutions sent in photos and renderings and had to complete a questionnaire that was very specific
8024402 university business is greatly respected and read by everyone i know who is looking to improve the quality of student life so it is an honor for us to be selected for inclusion
8024403 it highlights woffords commitment to create a living environment for our students that encourages interaction and a connection with each other
8024404 mcmillan smith amp partners worked closely with wofford toward a mutual goal the creation of a stimulating and highly anticipated senior year experience for students
8024405 the urban village environment creates a sense of community that engages immediately creates a positive experience and reinforces the student to college relationship
8024406 when i read about the projects some of these kids are doing i think i want to go
8024407 theyre really so exciting and theyre doing things that really need to be done its not just busywork they are in the midst of high powered things
8024408 one of the things that wofford does very well is prepare people to think and problem solve and learn new things and communicate
8024409 what these students are exposed to not only in terms of their field but also in terms of meeting people is incredible
8024410 theyre meeting really neat people people they wouldnt necessarily get to meet here at wofford or at any other school its very important for them to get away from school in the summer and not just work with the equipment theyll need to master but the people they must get along with as well its a wonderful opportunity
8024411 wofford has sent a number of students to various nasa institutions
8024412 we are a member of the south carolina space grant consortium being a member our students and faculty members can apply for funding from south carolina and the consortium will pay for their summer internship program
8024413 weve sent a number of students 13 or 14 students to the jet propulsion laboratory in southern california this year we dont have any at the jet propulsion lab but we have trey and brad at nasa ames in northern california we got another student marshall washburn computer science 09 into an internship at nasa langley
8024414 one of our students kristin kountz 09 is a chemistry major who is getting an emphasis in computational science and wants to go to medical school
8024415 shes very interested in research thats being done at vanderbilt universitys medical school
8024416 kristin took it upon herself before fall break to contact the person who is the head of undergraduate internship programs she told them shed be there on her fall break and asked to speak to them for a couple of minutes she was thinking shed be lucky to get a 15 minute interview with the person because of kristins initiative that person set up an entire day for her she had med students take her out to lunch they were so impressed with kristin that they offered her an internship by the end of the day
8024417 for 11 summers ive done research internships for faculty members at various government laboratories
8024418 that was so beneficial that i wanted the students to have opportunities like that weve been working with that for a number of years trying to get students into it
8024419 if i hear a really good talk from someone whos doing some kind of nifty research ill go up to that person afterward give them my card and tell them about woffords computational science program and the computer science program and what the students are able to do
8024420 when you first tell them about the students theyre like yeah uh huh but when you tell them what courses the students have had and what they know their tone changes considerably suddenly its oh really and theyre making eye contact and they become excited about the possibilities
8024421 making personal contacts is really good also sometimes just looking on the internet and seeing that someone is doing something really nifty and e mailing them or seeing programs that look interesting and getting the students to make the contacts and follow through
8024422 china fell in love with ping pong 40 years ago at that time china was still quite backwards and ping pong became something that we could show off to the world
8024423 ping pong requires very little space and very little to play only two people are needed to have a game i think ping pong is the most popular sport in china like basketball is in the u s other sports like diving are also very popular but not everyone has access to a swimming pool
8024424 after table tennis became an olympic sport more people began to get interested and more people wanted play table tennis
8024425 young people playing in my club dont go on to be professionals because they have to be really specialized
8024426 at the schools they are scouted for their speed agility hand eye co ordination endurance and a decision is made after assessing those things whether or not they should invest the time to go professional
8024427 im trying to get better improve my skills and my technique
8024428 i play with my friends at school and i want to get better so i can compete against them
8024429 young people want to play table tennis because they want to play it for fun not necessarily for professional or a career
8024430 its very popular many people play table tennis and many of my classmates play table tennis its more popular than basketball or football soccer
8024431 we continue to have concerns in particular for these eight children which is why we have asked the judge to review the case
8024432 whether the children are in any immediate danger simply because their parents choose to raise them in this religion
8024433 the substance of what theyre doing here is fundamentally the same
8024434 if it hadnt been for a parent of one of the children there they could have operated a long time
8024435 he had religious garments on robes skullcaps he came across as very religious
8024436 there were little houses out back and some kind of ritual circle that he had made
8024437 he had this doomsday theory that was fascinating that california was going to slide off into the ocean and send a tidal wave from west to east the spot the mountain where thornton is would be safe he had writings to support it the guy was a genius a maniacal genius
8024438 if it hadnt been for a parent of one of the children there they could have operated a long time
8024439 he had religious garments on robes skullcaps he came across as very religious
8024440 there were little houses out back and some kind of ritual circle that he had made

8024442 ellen goldey has been at the forefront of the national science foundation efforts to improve and enhance science education in america at the undergraduate level
8024443 it comes as no surprise that the nsf and sencer have chosen to honor her they have made a wise and strategically smart selection
8024444 professor goldey has been a long term leader in the sencer program beginning with her enthusiastic participation in our first summer institute and continuing though her subsequent distinguished service as a senior associate and core faculty member at institutes and sencer meetings
8024445 ellen plans to work to support the expansion of sencer courses at wofford and to assist peers on a regional and national basis in developing more effective assessment strategies designed to enhance achievement and deepen learning
8024446 we in the national fellowship board and the national center have the highest hopes and expectations for the success of ellens efforts and look forward to having the benefit of her advice and counsel as we plan for the future
8024447 er zal aandachtig worden gekeken naar het aantal verkochte nieuwe woningen maandag werd het beter dan verwachte cijfer over bestaande woningverkopen teniet gedaan door een aanzienlijke toename van de huizenvoorraad doordat executieveilingen de markt overspoelden
8024448 prijzen zullen niet stabiliseren met deze trend hierdoor is het moeilijk om de bodem te vinden van aandelenkoersen die gebaseerd zijn op amerikaans onroerend goed ook kunnen we het einde van afwaarderingen door banken zo niet voorspellen wat het vertrouwen in de financiele sector in het algemeen niet ten goede komt
8024449 i was really impressed with the caliber of civilians invited to the sis
8024450 within our seminar group we had an ambassador a corporate vice president and in steve we also had a professor with an extraordinary background
8024451 because of his military experience steve was able to talk the talk he was a mayor a ceo and he worked for exxon for 11 years he provided excellent insight and different perspectives being a professor of finance and having his high level experience in the corporate world he often added the economic impact to the discussions with regards to current events such as gas prices irregular warfare and iraq
8024452 i think with each group they said how can we come up with a mixture here where all three people will bring something to the party and bring in new and different ideas
8024453 i think that was their main objective as far as injecting us into the environment
8024454 we got to see firsthand what these students are being taught and how theyre reacting to it on a number of really important topics i was delighted with the topic they chose for us irregular warfare
8024455 it was 40 years between the time i finished my reserve duty and today
8024456 having been away from it for 40 years to have a chance to get immersed in it with people who work on some of these issues as a full time job was thrilling and quite encouraging i might add
8024457 at exxon we would have called manuel and people like him the high potential list
8024458 ask yourself what their sources are and what the authors agenda is another area emphasized at the war college was developing strategic courses of actions for any potential conflicts such as iran north korea africa or even china
8024459 the purpose of the war college is not only to learn about war
8024460 this is an exciting time to address problems issues and values associated with energy and sustainability
8024461 through this lecture series santee cooper provides the wofford community and the spartanburg community with a powerful forum for meetings and discussions with some of the leading thinkers in the world on these issues
8024462 energy policy opportunities and challenges are at the forefront of south carolinians minds this robust collaboration between academia and public power will foster critical thinking innovative dialogue and enhanced value to the state
8024463 for santee cooper protection and improvement of our environment are equal in importance to providing affordable energy
8024464 those objectives are breadth depth communication collaboration and conduct and a learning environment
8024465 ik weet niet of we aan het eind van het jaar kunnen zeggen dat we cashflow positief zijn geweest
8024466 we blijven met vechtlust kijken naar acquisitiemogelijkheden als de kans zich voordoet zullen we er bovenop spingen
8024467 kijkend naar de nettoschuldpositie van 1 2 ruim onder de doelstelling van maximaal 3 is er meer dan voldoende ruimte voor verder groei
8024468 er is veel consolidatie in onze sector veel bedrijven bieden zich aan het is alleen nog niet gelukt een goede match te vinden
8024469 de belangrijkste voorwaarde om dividend uit te keren is dat we winst maken
8024470 daarnaast moet de solvabiliteit minimaal 35 bedragen om 30 van de winst uit te keren in de vorm van dividend
8024471 has anyone ever told you youre like martha stewart on steroids or crack
8024472 we havent got a lot of sleep and we havent really done anything else besides look for her she was all i had when he was in iraq so he finally got back and now shes gone
8024473 so it was going to be the honeymoon that we had put off for a year and a half come back pack up and leave but im not real sure what were going to do now
8024474 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8024475 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8024476 check your departure airport to see if your flight may be affected
8024477 it could be any location because one facility is now processing flight data for everybody
8024478 there are cancelations due to weather from the hurricane but not due to this
8024479 were not going to let an unsafe condition exist its just going to be slower
8024480 choosing a four year undergraduate college is one of the biggest decisions a typical american family can make and for too many years information about the quality of american higher education has been monopolized by one publication
8024481 in conjunction with dr richard vedder an economist at ohio university and the center for college affordability and productivity forbes com inaugurates its first ranking of americas best colleges an annual list in this report the ccap ranks 569 undergraduate institutions based on the quality of the education they provide and how much their students achieve
8024482 wofford college outpaces cornell university duke johns hopkins and dartmouth
8024483 during the first week groups of 12 students collaborate to build a world in the second week they each write stories design games and illustrate their shared world while maintaining consistency the worlds will be displayed online using a wiki program so that students and parents can watch the world come to life
8024484 wofford is attempting to provide creative intellectual experiences of the highest quality for talented young people
8024485 shared worlds is a pilot program aimed at doing so by combining writing literature technology and the fantasy literary genre we hope to introduce additional initiatives that are equally creative and intellectually stimulating in the years ahead and believe this will serve as a prototype for such development
8024486 each group of 12 students chooses a genre science fiction or fantasy
8024487 then they create their imaginary world together drawing on each others strengths and interests whether its history or philosophy or science or something else it all goes in there they must compromise work together and make hard decisions
8024488 some schools draw distinct lines between the disciplines history is history literature is literature math is math
8024489 but at wofford its about cross pollinating about working together physics professors team up with poets and religion professors team teach with journalists sparks fly and students benefit from that kind of energy in a classroom
8024490 when i began i intended to study cultural perspectives on environmental change specifically change initiated by forces of modernization and globalization in developing nations
8024491 by observing the effects of aspects of development such as hydroelectric power projects economic initiatives and sustainability and conversation plans i wanted to explore the difficult conflict between traditional culture and modernization with primary emphasis on how this plays out in the day to day life during my travels i focused primarily on community based initiatives linking environmental conservation and management with cultural preservation
8024492 flexibility is a quality i had to prepare and develop just to absorb all the little problems and surprises that come up along the way
8024493 but overall everything went quite smoothly knowing that each day when i woke up and went outside that i would meet new people and try new foods the most unappetizing of which ranged from starfish to blood cubes to silk worms and engage with new problems and cultural encounters was both challenging and an incredible thrill of experience and sensory overload and amazingly enough the airlines never once lost my pack
8024494 even if just for the challenges that i faced each day in reassessing priorities and the way that people work together and interact i saw an incredible amount of diversity and life in a relatively short period of time and it will take a great deal longer than that to really process all that i encountered there were days when it was difficult to keep moving forward because i wondered what i was doing and then there were days when i felt energized and could not have wished to be anywhere else
8024495 there will be a great deal i have to think about and process but that will bring a new imperative to what i will do now
8024496 particularly with the responsibility i feel to share what ive learned with fellow students as a means to passing on that imperative of action and engagement
8024497 for the time being im investigating and applying to graduate programs in english and history with an emphasis on colonial studies
8024498 daar hebben ze nog geen financiele details over gegeven ik hoop dat ze daar iets meer over zullen toelichten
8024499 we did not just look at their english speaking ability although that was an important part of it
8024500 it was sort of a way to measure the kind of success they could have here by asking lots of cultural questions and liberal arts questions
8024501 programs like this fit in well with woffords united methodist heritage
8024502 we paid for 75 percent of the cost and the rwandan government picks up the rest
8024503 i want to go to medical school and become a doctor because ive always been interested in helping all people
8024504 i want to do a residency in psychology because there are not that many people who study the mind in rwanda
8024505 there are rwandan students interested in engineering and construction to build infrastructure from railroads to roads to building
8024506 there is a student who is interested in computerizing medical records and many of them are interested in the world of pharmaceuticals each of their interests are different but overall the common goal they share is developing their country
8024507 gezien de huidige koers van gustav maken we logistieke plannen om personeel te evacueren dat niet essentieel is voor productie of booroperaties
8024508 there are other programs around the country where students do research like things either to assist a professor or simply to do a project thats in the methodology of research but not really new or original but these are all original projects theyre things that havent been done before and at least in theory theyre all publishable if theyre successful
8024509 its really amazing some of the things these students have accomplished
8024510 and this is a community theyre all working on research full time for the summer there are a wide range of topics here the different projects may not have a lot in common in terms of research to talk about but the students can talk about methodologies and how things are similar and different
8024511 he is among a handful of most admired christians of the 20th century
8024512 i would like to do research later during grad school and even after grad school so this is definitely an advantage in terms of applying for grad school but also simply for the experience itself ive gotten experience working with other professors and students from other colleges who ive collaborated with on this project this program has also taught me that there is a lot more in research than i could have possibly thought before in science your projects are reviewed by peers and arent automatically accepted as valid or correct its been a great experience so far
8024513 one of the nicest features of the program is that the time from concept to acceptance and then project is very short you find out within a month whether youre in or not if you apply to a big grant agency it might take a year or more for undergraduate students a year or more is forever
8024514 if i had to go through this i could at least be an example of trying to live out whats right trying to stand strong and trying to just keep my faith intact
8024515 we gave the truth to the jury we are happy we had an opportunity to try our case
8024516 this lawsuit in my opinion should not have been filed because nothing happened
8024517 its a great vindication and shows us the faithfulness of god
8024518 ironically its the films that allowed me to progress spiritually to the point i left mormonism
8024519 there was indian cinema for the indian community gay and lesbian cinema was starting to mature there was black cinema
8024520 i realized theres 12 million mormons in this country and we dont have a cinema of our own
8024521 but after filming several other of the genres touchstone works dutcher renounced mormonism last year citing a theological evolution he calls
8024522 one of the best small pictures of its kind in recent memory
8024523 in one moment i went from being a true believer to knowing that everything i had thought about god everything i thought about the universe the way i looked at the world might be off
8024524 ironically its the films that allowed me to progress spiritually to the point i left mormonism if i hadnt been making films i doubt i would have reached that point
8024525 at that point the representation of mormons on tv and in movies had been pretty negative it was all polygamy and crazy people really extreme and marginal
8024526 one of my main impulses was to portray mormons as real people
8024527 too many badly made films in the marketplace too few good ones
8024528 one day in prayer all by myself i asked myself the question what if its all not true
8024529 it was an earth shaking moment of spiritual terror such a profound experience it was such a sense of loss i felt my faith leaving me and never coming back
8024530 richard became a local lightning rod because he accepted what might be called an ill informed and premature title like the father of mormon cinema
8024531 he didnt make it up nor did he ask for it but i think hes also done little to distance himself from it
8024532 what youre seeing on his face is exhaustion and despair
8024533 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
8024534 the case against barack obama the unlikely rise and unexamined agenda of the medias favorite candidate
8024535 while hype may not generate large box office receipts it is sure to become another prong in the right wing attack machine
8024536 citizens united head david bossie might be hopeful that as the campaign moves forward some right wing websites might offer the film as a premium as they have for the books
8024537 in order to get regular voters to go see the movie it will have to garner media buzz on the cable television news networks like the anti obama books have
8024538 looking at both the television advertisement for the film and its five minute trailer its clear that neither bossie nor alan peterson the films director have chops theyre no michael moore
8024539 another rich liberal elitist from massachusetts who claims hes a man of the people priceless
8024540 the guy at the country club with the beautiful date holding a martini and a cigarette that stands against the wall and makes snide comments about everyone who passes by
8024541 bossie is a political hatchet man whose career is based on smears and attacking democrats
8024542 his obama documentary will provide plenty of footage for use on the internet and in commercials but i doubt that in and of itself that
8024543 i assume that the overall theme of obama as socialist agent disguised as cult hero must be resonating in the political marketing surveys of the bossie types and the mccain operatives or they would switch to something more effective
8024544 going back to the days when he was unremitting in his attacks against bill and hillary clinton bossies forte has never been accuracy
8024545 it has been bloodletting and in that regard if hype gets any traction at all it is likely to be viewed as the political counterpart of the horror movie franchise saw v due to be released just before the election
8024546 het is speculatief maar we zullen deze nieuwe studie in dat geval waarschijnlijk ook doorzetten
8024547 op basis van metingen over meerdere jaren kan een claim worden gelegd op een causale werking van een product terwijl resultaten over e e n jaar alleen een symptomatische werking kunnen claimen
8024548 we verwachten dat de resultaten van het tweede seizoen overtuigender zullen zijn dan die van het eerste seizoen
8024549 it took us six weeks of collecting data 10 hours a day every day of the week rats dont take the weekend off
8024550 we would give the rats linoleic acid which is one of the most prominent fatty acids
8024551 the rats form a very strong conditioned response to what they have eaten if they can taste it
8024552 we conditioned the two groups and then tested them using 15 second trials we wanted to be able to say that any change in their behavior was because of the taste they were responding to what was happening in their mouths
8024553 the thing i liked is that we were able to provide behavioral evidence that supports the molecular cellular evidence shown by tim
8024554 its what the big boys do at big universities here we are at wofford running in the same race with them in those terms i think its a big deal for wofford students to have the opportunity to publish an article is great
8024555 i definitely think that working in the lab and getting these publications helped these students immensely
8024556 getting into two peer review publications is pretty unheard of for undergraduates even those who work in labs at major universities it helps not just because of the proof that comes with being published but because of the knowledge and skillset gained its a huge asset to our students going into graduate school thats what professors and graduate programs are looking for
8024557 dit komt met name door de divisie fagron en hogere overhead kosten
8024558 have recently made the most promising and innovative changes in academics faculty students campus or facilities
8024559 the formula used to determine which colleges and universities offer the best value relates a schools academic quality as indicated by its 2009 u s news ranking to the 2007 2008 academic year net cost of attendance for a student who receives the average level of need based financial aid the higher the quality of the program and the lower the cost the better the deal

8024562 this was a teaching technique that dr lewis jones used during interim classes at wofford several times over the years during his long and distinguished career
8024563 the first interim was in january 1968 i was on that trip with dr jones
8024564 working together to plan the yearly two day trip has become kind of a fun thing for each of us
8024565 its a good combination of baby boomers who were at wofford with dr jones and knew him as a teacher and then some senior citizens many of whom are wofford alums who just enjoy that kind of travel
8024566 the camaraderie on the trip is great most of the people on the trips have been doing it every year for 10 years
8024567 our goal is to give participants a first hand exposure to historical events and places of significance in their own backyards
8024568 the outcomes are a greater appreciation and understanding of our state its people and the significant role this has played in the history of our nation
8024569 participants tend to gain a curiosity leading to further reading study and participation in events relating to the area in which we travel participation in the orbiting seminar helps each person see and understand the importance of historical preservation and the threats posed to our state historic sites our hope is that each person will share what they learn with other people
8024570 the first year we went to portions of spartanburg upper greenville pickens and oconee counties the second trip was to the midlands and columbia the next year we went to the charleston area with the themes down to ashley and up the cooper weve been to beaufort georgetown edgefield and the pee dee area around bennettsville and cheraw
8024571 were discovering the up country or the cherokee trail if you will on day one
8024572 some of the places were going are the ninety six star fort which is a park now but was the scene of a major colonial outpost that got its name from being 96 miles from kiawah town
8024573 on day two were going to spend most of the day in abbeville which just recently won a significant national preservation award preserve america initiative well be looking at a typical southern railroad town of around 1900 that has maintained its personality as we visit museums several houses and churches as we conclude the tour we will have dinner at the famous yoders restaurant for mennonite cooking
8024574 a really important person in this picture is rodger stroup
8024575 rodger was on that original interim trip with me and then after that we both ended up in history graduate school at the same time at usc
8024576 we have actually been to greenwood and abbeville twice for scouting the first time we are just looking for places we might want to go the second time we get serious we really do a lot of work leading up to it but then we enjoy it when it comes its not really work in that sense
8024577 charlie is remarkable as a leader of excursions like this
8024578 hes really detailed as a planner and such a friendly outgoing person
8024579 one of the traditions of a lewis jones trip is that we meet local guides
8024580 arrangements are usually made for somebody who really knows the local territory to get on the bus and lead the tour we have local guides in most of the places were going
8024581 too often staff ratios in out of school settings are low and numbers of qualified leaders and staff do not meet requirements putting at risk the quality of childcare in these settings
8024582 the spotlight has shifted away from those working with school aged children and they have been left behind its a part of childcare that has often been the cinderella service
8024583 there are some very young children spending a lot of time in out of school clubs and the experience they have there can have a huge impact on all parts of their lives
8024584 this can be put towards training for out of school childcare
8024585 if he complies with all the terms of the agreement itll get dismissed
8024586 let us put our minds together and see what life we can make for our children
8024587 ik weet niet of we aan het eind van het jaar kunnen zeggen dat we cashflow positief zijn geweest
8024588 we denken dat er genoeg animo voor zal zijn de hele voorbereiding is achter de rug in de volgende fase gaan we potentiele kopers benaderen
8024589 we just basically told him the truth we showed him all the data
8024590 the reason we are doing this is because we are in a very strong position with production offices in 25 countries and direct relationships with hundreds of broadcasters

8024592 this is an exceptionally strong starting point from which to build further

8024597 aangezien al het goede nieuws al in de aandelenprijs verwerkt lijkt te zijn
8024598 thats a good question and it should be a simple one
8024599 but right now i feel like theres so many aspects of our great nation which could use a little bit of help or a lotta bit of help that its hard to pick just one
8024600 i think the most important thing is the economy we need to figure out the housing crisis we need to build up our middle class again right now the disparity between the uber rich and the uber poor its worrying and its not getting better we need to focus on a way to just get our economy back to get it back on track

8024693 i think theyll mccain and obama both govern from a place that is far less imperious
8024694 the nightly news is sort of the aggregator that will die the idea that someone will come home at 6 p
8024695 my guess is that its not particularly on his radar
8024696 were here to introduce him to 20 year olds smoking out of apple bongs
8024697 we dont have the ability to report that takes a lot of time to synthesize
8024698 they chose a place where it is literally a mile above the american people

8024704 these are folks who show up and show up with their celebrity but are using it to make sure people are conscious of an issue and raise awareness
8024705 these conventions are the focus of all media and so when you do have politically active celebrities who have become involved in an issue or cause what better place for them to go than where the entire national press corps is gathered in one place
8024706 it has got the potential to be a fun little sideshow
8024707 its becoming too much of a sideshow to be honest it looks like every celebrity who wants to dip their toe into politics wants to show up in denver
8024708 we live in a celebrity obsessed culture for good or for bad thats the world we live in
8024709 what we do is use that celebrity power for the common good
8024710 you need to get involved in an issue that means something to you
8024711 for people who cant think in a nuanced way and want to say that a celebrity is one thing then its going to be a problem
8024712 for people who understand that public figures are going to come in all shapes and sizes its fine
8024713 its like having the emmys oscars and grammys within two days of each other in different cities
8024714 these are folks who show up and show up with their celebrity but are using it to make sure people are conscious of an issue and raise awareness

8024723 were bringing our delegation from the 51st state of hollywood
8024724 the issue based organizations and the issue based causes have paired up with some of the celebrities and some of the corporate interests
8024725 it feels a lot more like were not just focusing on a party
8024726 theyve produced in a sense their own four day american idol
8024727 the single bottom line is whether either party can articulate a cogent comprehensive economic strategy that this country will respond to
8024728 this is their shot and i would hate it if they didnt have four hours of network time to make their cases
8024729 if youre looking for breaking news the convention is not the place to look for it
8024730 but if youre looking to understand the candidates better if youre looking to get a firmer grip on where they stand and where they go and to take a measure you need to watch
8024731 theres always the possibility a story could happen because of that
8024732 how are the clintons going to handle being second fiddle frankly its for the first time ever since being first fiddle
8024733 its a great story with a lot of different angles
8024734 when theres a pause in the action in the online room for brit hume you can see cameras crossing through and directors talking its a cool page 2 into the newsroom
8024735 itll be a rush because of the football schedule but well be prepared

8024748 theres no question that it was softer than it might have been but the results were fine
8024749 we didnt really pop in the bigger markets which is a little disappointing
8024750 but we have a family movie that we feel can still play over the labor day weekend
8024751 theres no question that it was softer than it might have been but the results were fine
8024752 we didnt really pop in the bigger markets which is a little disappointing
8024753 but we have a family movie that we feel can still play over the labor day weekend
8024754 we didnt really have a sense of what was going on out there we knew there was a potential for a problem
8024755 the state has that evidence now or i believe they do
8024756 im praying to become a heavenly comfort wife for you i feel so close to you
8024757 it appears the uc is attempting to secularize private religious schools
8024758 confirms that uc may apply the same admissions standards to all students and to all high schools without regard to their religious affiliations
8024759 any instance of gods guidance of history or any alternative to evolution
8024760 instructs that the bible is the unerring source for analysis of historical events
8024761 if scientific conclusions contradict the word of god the conclusions are wrong
8024762 we evaluate the courses to see whether they prepare these kids to come to college at uc
8024763 there was no evidence that these students were in fact denied the ability to come to the university
8024764 if it comes from certain publishers or from a religious perspective uc simply denies them
8024765 there are potentially all sorts of fraud issues associated with beazer to include corporate mortgage or investments in varying degrees
8024766 for a pattern of personal conduct which includes violations of company policies
8024767 local training will now enable us to further assist our partners to succeed and follows a recruiting drive earlier in the year for new channel partners committed to offering our contact centre automation enterprise ip telephony unified communications self service automation and sip supported voip solutions
8024768 consumers in australia and new zealand have become increasingly environmentally aware the impact a product has on the environment is now a significant factor in consumers purchasing decisions
8024769 weve gone to extraordinary lengths to have everything from ethernet cables to chipsets to unit housing recycled we are truly making the move to be more environmentally friendly in everything we do
8024770 the safety and integrity of our products is key to our relationship with our customers
8024771 certain chemicals and substances become labelled as hazardous materials due to government industry and consumer concerns d link acknowledges those concerns and guarantees the safety of our products for the end user
8024772 the most radically innovative technology in computing over the past 10 years
8024773 in moores law terms what weve done with gpus is extraordinary
8024774 few technologies have made the leaps that the gpu has over the past 10 years years ago the gpu was really just an accelerator an application specific integrated circuit now its a general purpose parallel computing processor
8024775 when i got started in my career in 1984 a cray x mp cost us 1 million
8024776 their computational capability has reached into the teraflops or 1 000 cray x mps
8024777 were so excited about via were optimizing our entire software stack for new via cpu nano
8024778 larrabee hasnt shipped so you dont know what it is and i dont know what it is
8024779 that said by the time it does ship nvidias technology will be so far advanced it wont matter
8024780 the internet doesnt run on x86 it just doesnt no matter how often intel says it does
8024781 its not giving us the closure we need today especially for her mother and the family
8024782 money is such a poor means of exchange for the value of a soul
8024783 we have been involved in extensive negotiations with plaintiffs and we hope we can reach a group resolution of the claims
8024784 based on advice from legal counsel and on prayerful reflection over this most difficult matter i believe that this settlement while costly is a responsible resolution for these individuals and their families and in the best interest of the diocese
8024785 of those 47 plaintiffs i dont know which ones im concerned with or which ones are concerned with me
8024786 in depositions that were made some of my accusers admitted that they didnt even know me
8024787 these are 47 families who have suffered from clergy abuse for years
8024788 they need to move on and the fact that money will be available soon is important
8024789 no woman can call herself free who does not own and control her own body
8024790 never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world indeed it is the only thing that ever has
8024791 it is absolutely astounding that at this stage of proceedings terria has not settled on a technology or even turned its mind to who its vendors will be
8024792 first egan said he would be asking telstra to take a major stake in terria despite telstra repeatedly making clear this is simply not going to happen
8024793 but most concerning of all egan made clear that none of the terrias existing shareholders is likely to be around in 10 years time australians will be relying on the nbn for decades to come and they need a builder that is committed for the long haul not fly by nighters
8024794 based on these efforts we remain highly confident that our systems and processes prevented the intrusion from compromising red hat network or the content distributed by rhn and accordingly believe that customers who keep their systems updated using red hat network are not at risk
8024795 since nakedextreme uses an unbundled local loop service it doesnt need to co exist with analogue telephony which means we can deliver broadband much further from the exchange
8024796 to date we have succeeded in connecting broadband customers living as far as 7 5 km from the exchange
8024797 with that increased radius we can increase the coverage area by more than three times compared with the previous 4 1km broadband delivery limit so we see great potential to fill in many of the blackspots that exist in metropolitan areas
8024798 chances are the cult members are going to do what she tells them to do
8024799 is in the middle of one of the greatest careers our industry has ever seen
8024800 united artists will continue to make the films under the credit facility and theres not going to be any changes
8024801 he did the catharsis interview on oprah this past may which was the smart thing to do and put all that behind him he has thick skin you dont get to be his age and his success level without taking some hits without having some purple hearts
8024802 he has always been willing to take chances in his career and what he did in the movie was amazing to me he has a great sense of humor and his work elevated the picture
8024803 its the first time that ive actually been able to figure out how to make my standup into a sitcom format which is totally unusual and totally different
8024804 its like a sitcom but with real people its kind of a different take on what is reality but what is comedy so its comedy but its also very real and different
8024805 thumpin it the use and abuse of the bible in todays presidential politics
8024806 heresy in the university the black athena controversy and the responsibilities of american intellectuals
8024807 america must stand firmly on the side of freedom and justice
8024808 drill here drill now drill here drill now four legs good two legs bad
8024809 the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
8024810 want americans to move to the urban core live in tenements take light rail to their government jobs
8024811 mr bush is the triumph of the seemingly average american man
8024812 hes not an intellectual intellectuals start all the trouble in the world
8024813 if theres a fire on the block hell run out and help
8024814 his ministry is a gift the episcopal church so desperately needs
8024815 bishop bennison should not be permitted to resume his episcopate in the diocese of pennsylvania under any circumstances
8024816 his credibility and lack of appropriate pastoral sensitivity demonstrate he could not effectively lead the diocese
8024817 i trusted him to be my pastor and he abandoned me
8024818 john distorted and perverted my understanding of god but charles stole the church from me
8024819 the value of one soul outweighs the many good works of the bishop
8024820 should not be permitted to remain as a bishop in the episcopal church
8024821 keep all the people of the diocese of pennsylvania safe from harm
8024822 there are frankly not very many people who possess charles unique combination of intellectual personal pastoral and spiritual gifts
8024823 bishop bennisons misconduct reflected fundamental aspects of his character that render him unfit to serve as a member of the clergy
8024824 the human brain is always trying to determine why things happen and when the reason is not clear we tend to make up some pretty bizarre explanations
8024825 christians and new agers paranormalists etc all have one thing in common a spiritual orientation to the world
8024826 i believe they do exist but im not sure about this
8024827 i guess we will find out if this is on the up and up
8024828 while it is difficult to know for certain the tendency to believe in the paranormal appears to be there from the beginning
8024829 what changes is the content of the paranormal for example very few people believe in faeries and elves these days but as belief in faeries faded other beliefs such as belief in ufos emerged to take their place
8024830 it is an artifact of our brains desire to find cause and effect
8024831 that ability to predict the future is what makes humans smart but it also has side effects like superstitions and belief in the paranormal
8024832 humans first started believing in the supernatural because they were trying to understand things they couldnt explain
8024833 its basically the same process as mythology at one point people didnt understand why the sun rose and set each day so they suggested that a chariot pulled the sun across the heavens
8024834 they didnt understand why a child was stillborn or why a drought occurred so they came to believe that such events had supernatural causes
8024835 all societies have invoked the supernatural to explain things beyond their control and understanding especially good and bad events
8024836 in many places even today people believe that disasters or bad luck is caused by witches or curses
8024837 i believe that new orleans had a level of sin that was offensive to god and they are were recipients of the judgment of god for that
8024838 paranormal beliefs are very strongly negatively related to religious belief
8024839 this may partly reflect opinions of christians in the samples who take biblical sanctions against many paranormal activities seriously
8024840 my guess is that religiosity has a lot to do with how you were raised and less to do with genetics
8024841 those people who may have a high genetic susceptibility to faith based knowledge may end up being highly religious or may end up having belief in the paranormal depending on how they were raised those people less susceptible to that method of forming beliefs may still end up being highly religious if they were raised in a religious family
8024842 among christians those who attend church very often and are exposed to stigma and sacrifice within their congregations are least likely to believe in the paranormal
8024843 conversely those christians who do not attend church very often maybe once or twice a year are the most likely to hold paranormal beliefs
8024844 are much less likely to consult horoscopes visit psychics purchase new age items
8024845 however among those christians who do not attend church there is a much higher level of participation in these phenomena
8024846 perhaps amazingly paranormal beliefs are not related at all to education
8024847 ph d s are as likely as high school dropouts to believe in bigfoot loch ness monster ghosts etc
8024848 many paranormalists claim that their powers only work sometimes or that they dont work if there is a non believer in the room
8024849 nothing will change in regard to cruises involvement with ua and he continues to have a substantial ownership interest in the company furthermore cruise and wagner will continue to work on film projects together

8024860 suppose for example youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that person can deliver on anything candidate y disagrees with you on half the issues but you believe that on the other half the candidate will be able to deliver for whom would you vote
8024861 the standards of learning for virginia public schools describe the commonwealths expectations for student learning and achievement in grades k 12 in english mathematics science history social science technology the fine arts foreign language health and physical education and driver education
8024862 virginia uses the standards of learning sol assessment program to test students in grades 3 through 8 high school students take the sol end of course test in various subjects and must pass at least six exams to graduate
8024863 twelve states alabama alaska idaho illinois michigan mississippi nebraska north carolina texas utah virginia emphasis added and west virginia received ds because they had pitched their expectations far below other states

8024865 no one really cares how many notes you can play or how fast you can play them if you cannot make a good characteristic sound so make that your first priority

8024868 criteria specific rating scales in the evaluation of high school instrumental performance
8024869 so were did it go wrong and how can we fix it
8024870 wisdom is not a product of schooling but of the lifelong attempt to acquire it

8024874 a systematic scoring guideline to evaluate students performance papers speeches problem solutions portfolios cases through the use of a detailed description of performance standards
8024875 rubrics should be clear easy to use and understand appropriate to the task and aligned with goals
8024876 by using a rubric students become more aware of their potential strengths and weaknesses in completing assignments
8024877 rubrics help students become more thoughtful judges of the quality of their own and others work
8024878 a rubric is a written description of what is expected from students in order for them to meet a certain level of performance
8024879 it was bogus shadows are shadows they are nothing like real things
8024880 i agree with him even if the people are held so that they can only see the shadows they are being held by real things that they can feel and the cave wall is real so what reason would they have to believe the shadows are real when they have real things around them
8024881 thats a good question why dont we take a deeper look at platos theory amy what do you think platos response to katherines question would be
8024882 teachers can adapt instruction on the basis of evidence making changes and improvements that will yield immediate benefits to student learning
8024883 students can use evidence of their current progress to actively manage and adjust their own learning
8024884 provide insight into students thinking and ensure that no student is invisible in the class
8024885 ask students to explain their answers whether or not the answers are correct ask students to share their solution strategies with the group call on students who dont volunteer put together small group work
8024886 probe the breadth and depth of what students know can do and value
8024887 collect information about students preferences interests ideas opinions and feelings
8024888 encourage students to clarify extend and fully articulate what is inside their heads
8024889 objective information about the quality of teaching and learning in urban schools monitor the quality of instruction and compare schools and teachers within each school

8024895 we want ten million dollars phone in your pledges america when we get to ten million we will shoot brian williams and katie couric live on tv
8024896 need to be curious about how children are learning teachers need to let that curiosity guide them rather than be guided by a preconceived notion of an exact body of knowledge that children have to have an attitude of inquiry enables us to really appreciate what children have to say if we allow ourselves to really listen to follow childrens interests and then create environments that are engaging and exciting then we wont feel pressured to push children beyond their current levels of interests and abilities if were going to do right by children we have to find ways to honor what they think and create environments that allow their thinking to grow we must give children lots of opportunities to show how they understand things understand in telling it to someone understand by drawing understand with some kind of construction we should never settle for a child parroting a particular bit of knowledge
8024897 we have to listen to children provide opportunities for them to talk and talk a lot and try to understand what they have said
8024898 so that they can adapt their own work to meet the needs educators can find out what the students need to know through observations classroom discussions individual student teacher conferences dialogue with the teacher provides the opportunity for the teacher to respond to and reorient students thinking
8024899 assessment formats questioning class discussions oral examinations journals and logs and conferences and interviews during student teacher conferences both parties speak together with the purpose to understand how to work effectively together
8024900 teachers obtain a lot of valuable information about student achievement by talking with them
8024901 see disadvantages or problems in this personalized one to one approach claim
8024902 how can it be done with thirty students per class a fifty minute period and students who must disappear as soon as the classes are over
8024903 how else can you get to know students and their writing talking to a whole class is just not efficient after reading their papers i know that each one needs different kinds of help
8024904 nowhere is classroom assessment more of an art then when using communication to track student growth and development
8024905 have goals but not predetermined directions we listen we ask questions we observe we demonstrate strategies and we respond with necessary information or answer to questions in the conference one on one situation permits a very different kind of interaction because the teacher does not and should not totally control the agenda with student interaction comes the kind of unpredictability that makes lesson plans and syllabi inappropriate and useless the conference is a dialogue in which teacher talk includes several general activities listening questioning observing showing and telling
8024906 before each round of conferences set the purposes of the conference i e establish a good working relationship with your students clarify your expectations for papers answer questions students have elaborate on your written comments check students understanding of written comments of course material of assignments keep the conference focused on what most needs work and on whats appropriate for where the student is with the assignment keep comments specific to the work and elaborate on them only
8024907 an agenda lose focus and are in danger of being totally teacher dominated
8024908 during conferences get students talking generating ideas articulating plans experimenting with language posing questions responding critically to their own ideas and drafts you may need to work to resist the urge to do all the talking and because some students will be uncomfortable meeting with you individually theyll be glad to let you do all the talking encourage students to write down specifics that emerge from your conversation ideas plans for revisions clarifications you should be concerned if students arent writing anything down and you should prompt them to do so thoughts and conversations are very ephemeral after a round of conferences is over spend some class time talking about them asking students what was helpful about the conferences sharing some students effective ideas and strategies with the whole class explaining what youve discovered many students need explained reflecting on what you learned from the conferences asking students for suggestions for improving the next round of conferences
8024909 key context factors which if attended carefully will keep bias from creeping into assessments and will maximize their accuracy
8024910 authors put in a lot of time and try multiple strategies to get their pieces right the teacher makes it a priority to record her interactions with students during these discussions
8024911 one to one setting of the conference is a superb teaching environment but that does not mean that putting a student and a teacher together will automatically result in better teaching and more learning no mystical transformation takes place ineffective teachers can remain ineffective indifferent or slow learners can remain indifferent or slow what the conference does provide is a setting where a different kind of teaching can take place
8024912 opens unique possibilities you can ask follow up questions to get beyond a particular response to explore its origins if you find misconceptions you can take immediate action to correct them you can follow up the failure with a few carefully phrased questions to see if it was due to a lack of prerequisite knowledge or to poor quality reasoning on the students part unlike some other forms of assessment personal communication can be spontaneous allowing you to take advantage of unexpected opportunities to assess and promote achievement i e when you sense a need for a bit more information on student thinking you can strike while iron is hot and take advantage of a teachable moment
8024913 teaching is intellectual and ethical work it takes thought reflection and caring to do it well we should embrace students as three dimensional creatures with hearts and minds and skills and dreams and capacities of their own as people much like ourselves sandel 2002
8024914 one must caution that simple blanket solutions to academic difficulties end up exhausting time resources and motivation
8024915 persistent pattern of inattention or hyperactivity impulsivity that is more frequently displayed and more severe than is typically observed in individuals at a comparable level of development

8024931 i think young girls are being forced to marry older men and i think that is rape
8024932 this seems to be crossing state lines and to be more than the states know what to do with
8024933 people cannot pick and choose which laws they want to abide by
8024934 are not doing a very good job of it you can go to any town in this state and find polygamists
8024935 if polygamists are working hard holding down jobs as far as im concerned we ought to leave them alone
8024936 the states and local governments are better able to understand those issues and separate out what really needs to be dealt with and what can be let go
8024937 i dont agree with the practice of polygamy but whether the federal government should go in
8024938 i just get concerned about how much power the government has
8024939 a comprehensive federal response should minimize if not eliminate the possibility that persons within the flds who may be predisposed to commit polygamy or other crimes will simply move their operations to another location
8024940 i am still waiting for a response to that request
8024941 a lot of people expect me to ask softball questions
8024942 they will not be softball they will be fair in fact im going to ask the identical questions to both candidates we flipped a coin and obama goes first for one hour and then john mccain will be in a cone of silence for an hour
8024943 i will ask the identical questions to john mccain so theres no bias theres no gotcha on one and not on the other no well he was too hard or too soft the identical questions and we call it a civil forum because i think you can disagree without being disagreeable without demonizing the opposition
8024944 working on this for about a month questions that dont have any wiggle room so that people just cant go into the well
8024945 what did you think of that when that was playing out
8024946 well i think theres a fundamental difference because evangelicalism and mormonism
8024947 theres no doubt about it and theres some things that mormons hold to that are not historic christianity that all lutherans all methodists all baptists all pentecostals all catholics protestants hold true
8024948 for instance all christians believe in the trinity mormons deny the trinity so thats a fundamental difference
8024949 all christians believe in the old testament and the new testament mormons believe in additional books that historic orthodox christians reject there may have been a misunderstanding on that but i dont even think thats the whole issue i think that there are other issues involved in terms of who has had experience who has had leadership and who understands my problems
8024950 it says he served gods purpose for his generation and then he died and thats my life verse he did serve gods purpose that which never changes but he did it in his generation he did it in a contemporary and relevant way he did the timeless in a timely way he did that which never changed in a world thats constantly changing and thats all that any of us can do my goal is to serve gods purpose in my generation and then ill die then the next guy will serve gods purpose in his generation and i believe god has a purpose for every life and if youre alive if your hearts beating god has a purpose for your life god has never done anything without a purpose
8024951 what harm is there in allowing a preacher to ask specific questions which many would like to know the answer to
8024952 was it really fair for bush to lower the taxes of people who have yachts and private planes and multi million dollar homes and at the same time start a war that the rest of us have to pay for
8024953 hate is preached in every church in america in its own subtle way all you have to do is open your ears and listen pat robertson and james dobson are the kings of hate
8024954 im a christian and even i agree that there is separation between church and state for a reason ive never heard of a debate solely on religious issues ever before in a presidential campaign what is going on and why isnt anyone disturbed by this
8024955 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
8024956 is it me or is mccain full of more vim and vigor enthusiasm than the layed back liberal nobama
8024957 imho mormons are a sect of christianity because they believe that jesus christ died for their sins
8024958 but getting a direct answer to a direct question is not easy when dealing with politicians
8024959 it is not a good thing to mix religion and politics the catholics are the reason why our economy is in a bad shape
8024960 im christian and also lds same thing i believe in the old and new testament
8024961 performance assessments typically ask students to show the processes of their thinking and reasoning so educators can make direct inferences on the nature and depth of students understanding
8024962 teacher creativity and initiative in planning lessons assessments and classroom organization
8024963 both logical and empirical evidence should be presented in order to draw valid inferences from performance assessments
8024964 grande fue la sorpresa al saberse la noticia de la derrota chilena recib mosla con frialdad y sepamos sacarle su utilidad
8024965 creer dice que los chilenos empezaron el match de manera magn fica no es verdad el error consisti precisamente en la prisa y la impulsividad gastadas en ese primer tiempo es una de las causales de la derrota los chilenos somos precipitados salimos a toda m quina pero paramos de repente sin motivo y como asustados de nosotros mismos no tenemos medida ni para beber ni para trabajar ni para divertirnos queremos hacerlo todo de golpe hasta extenuarnos hay cosas en nuestro temperamento que celebramos como buenas cualidades siendo as que son defectos
8024966 el individualismo es otro punto malo muy malo y de resultados negativos el jugador no debe tratar de lucirse sino de ganar la partida todo lo que se haga fuera de este fin es tonter a superficialidad vanidad solitarismo y derrota en esto queda retratada la sociedad chilena desligada llena de islas dividida en grupos hostiles vemos as como el deporte tiene una tr gica concordancia con la marcha de la naci n

8024977 and have had to cope with that kind of a situation it is not in the best interests of that 12 year old child or of any of the other siblings in the home

8025015 we think that human beings are mysterious but actually we wear our thoughts on our sleeve people give off lots of subconscious signals about what theyre thinking and we used to be sensitive to that kind of communication
8025016 we spend so much time communicating through machines computers and cellphones were losing our ability to communicate with other human beings most communication is not verbal its visual it looks like magic but its really like learning another language

8025020 the original has some qualities that cant be reproduced but a remake could have its own very different strengths and qualities
8025021 up until now i have always thought that pennsylvanias criminal justice system provided sufficient tools to deal with sex offenders such that civil commitments were not necessary
8025022 this case has demonstrated an unfortunate loophole regrettably george feigley fit through it
8025023 clearly this is a case that because of its age and its intensity has escaped statutes that we drafted that apply directly to sexual offenses
8025024 harassment is one of those legal words that is difficult to define figuring out where the line is between free speech and unprotected harassment has consumed many courts
8025025 i think what were doing is informing the public in a positive way
8025026 whether the system steps up and gets feigley out of our neighborhood or not at least were doing something to protect our kids
8025027 so far i think we have not seen the kind of political reconciliation thats going to bring about longterm stability in iraq
8025028 but the same factors that led me to oppose the surge still hold true the strain on our military has grown the situation in afghanistan has deteriorated and weve spent nearly 200 billion more in iraq than we had budgeted iraqs leaders have failed to invest tens of billions of dollars in oil revenues in rebuilding their own country and they have not reached the political accommodation that was the stated purpose of the surge

8025043 society thirsting for more control of more people substitutes religion for the spirit the body for the soul an identity for the individual and science and data for truth in this direction lies insanity increasing slavery less knowingness greater scarcity and less society
8025044 scientology has opened the gates to a better world it is not a psycho therapy nor a religion it is a body of knowledge which when properly used gives freedom and truth to the individual

8025059 one way to approach that discomfort of being around someone who swears a lot is to think of it as a problem of translation rather than a problem of appropriateness
8025060 all were asking for is some clarification on your ideas about flds owning property
8025061 i can honestly tell you i have no bias against flds i dont have a bias for flds or for people who have been formerly flds i truly have no view on that issue
8025062 i believe that in the long term efforts toward where this trust is going that the most appropriate thing is to allow and create the opportunity for people to be able to own their property and be able to control it im not going to put a religious test on that
8025063 the issue is if i own a piece of property and i own it like you own your house and then someone comes along and says but because of your religion were going to put on some extra restrictions
8025064 i want what ive wanted all along which is all the potential beneficiaries to have a say in how the trust is managed
8025065 it couldnt have been very easy for her to just drop it
8025066 women are realizing were not being recognized were being treated like second class citizens
8025067 i have been surrounded my whole life by very strong strong women i mean this sincerely i think you can tell the comfort a man has with women and whether or not he gets it or not by the women if the women around him are strong
8025068 what is the greater obligation of the country to give some very very wealthy people who are good people an additional hundred billion dollars in tax cuts or provide healthcare for every american solve every story youve heard up here
8025069 i really think youve got to let this sink in democrats this is not something thats beyond our reach its all about what your priorities are
8025070 our governor is out of town up in denver for some big party theyre throwing there
8025071 he was the picture of confidence but in some ways the confidence in ones self and confidence in ones country are not the same
8025072 i dont think he realizes what ordinary american families are going through
8025073 i dont think the bush administration understands what ordinary americans are going through but i do and thats why im running for president of the united states of america
8025074 i wish we could have done this in private because you know i dont know whether i would have made it through a lot of the tough times in my life without you guys
8025075 youre a big deal the democratic partys been my home the delaware democratic party has been my family
8025076 the deal would allow some states to cast votes for both obama and clinton before ending the roll call in acclamation for the illinois senator
8025077 and didnt michelle obama do a wonderful job tonight as well
8025078 this was a great night not only for the obama campaign but for our nation
8025079 barack and i are going to work hard to make you proud he is more than ready to be commander in chief
8025080 we have to do our part we need to register voters
8025081 when people know who barack obama is when they know what our family stands for
8025082 we want to make sure that beyond the glitz and the confetti and the celebrity that we talk about the facts
8025083 wed still be the land of liberty and a great nation but im afraid that the policies of barack obama would make america a weaker nation
8025084 barack obama was awol nowhere to be found on the issue of immigration

8025107 at the end of the day scientology is a business that operates as a cult pretending to be a religion
8025108 what they do to recruit actors is one thing what about the little children they get into the sea organization you hear my story and i got out and i got some sad tales and maybe i got ripped off for a good chunk of money if you look at that as compared to someone who joins the sea org its not even comparable a hundred hours probably is what the average sea org person works a week and then you get that for 50 years 40 years because they get them when theyre teenagers i mean thats taking peoples lives away thats enslaving somebodys mind
8025109 everybody has a right to believe what they want to believe but i dont believe that anybody has a right to trick anybody to hurt anybody to harm somebody for their own purposes
8025110 as everyone knows we are the ufo capital of alabama
8025111 we have come to realize that our somewhat different reputation and worldwide fame of having alleged ufo sightings should be fostered and cherished
8025112 theres a growing shift toward healthy plant based diets especially among people looking to lose weight and keep it off
8025113 theyre made to eat forage and were making them eat grain
8025114 mr banting was a fat man at age sixty five the five foot five banting weighted in at over two hundred pounds
8025115 banting was recently retired had no family history of obesity nor did he consider himself either lazy inactive or given to excessive indulgence at the table
8025116 nonetheless corpulence had crept up on him in his thirties as with many of us today despite his best efforts he took up daily rowing and gained muscular vigor a prodigious appetite and yet more weight
8025117 he cut back on calories which failed to induce weight loss but did leave him exhausted and beset by boils
8025118 luckily for banting he consulted a surgeon who had recently been to paris the doctor had just heard the great physiologist claude bernard lecture on diabetes
8025119 a diet of only meat and dairy would check the secretion of sugar in the urine of a diabetic
8025120 excessive obesity might be allied to diabetes as to its cause and if a purely animal diet were useful in the latter disease a combination of animal food with a vegetable diet that contained neither sugar nor starch might arrest the undue formation of fat
8025121 he ate three meals a day of meat fish or game usually five or six ounces at a meal with one or two stale toast or cooked fruit on the side he had his evening tea with a few more ounces of fruit or stale toast he scrupulously avoided any other food that might contain either sugar or starch in particular bread milk beer sweets and potatoes
8025122 despite a considerable allowance of alcohol in bantings regimen four or five glasses of wine each day a cordial every morning and an evening tumbler of gin whisky or brandy banting dropped thirty five pounds by the following may eight months later and fifty pounds by early the next year
8025123 i have not felt better in health than now for the last twenty six years he wrote
8025124 had entered the english language as a verb meaning to diet
8025125 gouty obese and nervous we strongly recommend him to bant
8025126 did what members of established societies often do when confronted with a radical new concept they attacked both the message and the messenger the lancet like todays newsweek first whined that bantings diet was old news second that his diet could be dangerous
8025127 its a glimpse of what the long tail might look like

8025131 so then what in the world drew so many poor people to early quakerism what in the world drew unsophisticated me free coffee and cookies after meeting
8025132 i do apologise to you for my 2003 letter which was poorly drafted and i regret open to interpretations which i did not intend
8025133 i expected an apology in which he admitted he got the whole thing wrong until that happens there will be no peace
8025134 the matter is not concluded yet and it is a lot better to try to make progress on these issues at a personal level rather than through the press
8025135 weve looked at these issues and we have the same rights as other citizens and will continue to exercise them legally and well

8025142 real emergency at present is the need to focus public opinion on the situation in south ossetia where there is no way of opening the humanitarian corridor the pope called for
8025143 we dont know unfortunately what we do know is through non official sources how the local villages are especially the georgian minority
8025144 we know there are burned out homes and fields destroyed villages etc there might be an even more serious situation there of which we are ignorant because we dont have access to that area
8025145 we have refugees who would like to return and who might be prevented from doing so because we must wait to see what type of norms are established and if they would be permitted to return to their homes

8025152 the current government mandate puts the company in a position of having to compete with foreign oil for feed for our livestock

8025183 just a couple of months ago it was an older gentleman that was killed and right before when i was first moving in it was another man that was running across the street and was killed
8025184 there was really no lighting there to tell you the truth i didnt even know there was a bus stop there until a while ago

8025208 ik kreeg veertig mensen onder me die hele andere idee n hadden over het werk dan de leiding in de bilt daar zat ik tussenin ik heb wel veel geleerd
8025209 daar heb ik een weeradviesbureau voor de landbouw opgezet in 2001 heb ik samen met een collega dat bureau van dlv gekocht nu ben ik eigen baas van weeronline bv en mijn compagnon en ik hebben vier werknemers in dienst
8025210 ik had als voordeel dat ik wel eens voor de camera had gestaan en verder was ik gewoon mezelf
8025211 ik kon maar vier dagen in de studio proefdraaien dat is heel weinig ik werd echt in het diepe gegooid maar het ging goed ik heb de eerste keer zonder veel haperingen doorstaan
8025212 wij werken zonder autocue dus je hebt geen tekst voor je en dat is spannend in het begin stond ik het laatste half uur voor de uitzending stijf van de stress ik had een dichtgeknepen keel mijn hart bonkte nu ben ik nog steeds wel een beetje gespannen van tevoren maar je moet natuurlijk ook niet te nonchalant worden anders kom je bijvoorbeeld te laat in de studio
8025213 het beeld moet het meeste werk doen ik wil niet mezelf op de voorgrond zetten maar me in dienst van het verhaal stellen je moet het niet te veel leuk willen maken met grapjes
8025214 ik kan zeggen het wordt rotweer of het gaat wel een beetje regenen maar verder is het een mooie dag de manier waarop je het neerzet bepaalt het gevoel dat mensen erbij krijgen
8025215 daar houd ik rekening mee bij de presentaties bijvoorbeeld zaterdagochtend langs het voetbalveld zal het wel koud zijn ik wil het weer tastbaar maken en goed overbrengen
8025216 ik heb wel een soort zendingsdrang verder beschouw ik het nog steeds als een erebaan

8025240 una vez m s este documento demuestra que en las cuatro esquinas del planeta se maltrata a la libertad de expresi n incluso en las democracias faltan por llevar a cabo algunos progresos
8025241 este informe censa las peores violaciones de la libertad de prensa cometidas en los estados represivos desde corea del norte hasta eritrea pasando por cuba y turkmenist n pero tambi n se interesa por las democracias en las que faltan por llevar a cabo algunos progresos
8025242 de ahora en adelante nos sentiremos preocupados por la evoluci n de la situaci n en 2007 ha a adido la organizaci n en el mes de enero han matado a seis periodistas y a cuatro colaboradores de los medios de comunicaci n
8025243 pero m s all de estas cifras referidas sobre todo a los periodistas muertos o encarcelados reporteros sin fronteras quiere dar la se al de alarma al t rmino de un a o 2006 marcado por la poca ambici n y a veces incluso la renuncia de los pa ses democr ticos a la hora de defender los valores que est n destinados a encarnar aunque todo el mundo o casi se reclama de los derechos humanos a la vista de los silencios y las pr cticas de unos y otros cabe preguntarse quien tiene ahora la autoridad moral requerida para encarnar una defensa sin complacencia de estas libertades
8025244 we did not defend properly on two occasions and it completely changed the face of the game
8025245 akinfenwa is a big strong lad and at times we did not handle him well enough at times we got too close to him and i am obviously unhappy about the result
8025246 last season was highly embarrassing and we mentioned it before the game but the important thing is to play the way you can and we did that
8025247 it is important in cup ties when you play lower league opposition that you score early
8025248 that releases the pressure because the pressure is on you no matter what people say
8025249 when you go out there is pressure to perform but i dont think we can have any complaints we performed
8025250 it sounds morbid but i enjoyed watching saints play unfortunately it was against my team
8025251 their movement and application was brilliant and we got ripped to bits
8025252 we are all gutted and the players are hurting but if we can learn from that then we can do all right at our level
8025253 im disappointed but you have to give them a lot of credit
8025254 they worked extremely hard for it and ultimately we werent bright enough on the night to win
8025255 i would never question my team for not putting a shift in as i think they did hartlepool seemed to have that extra edge in front of their home crowd
8025256 we gave them a sloppy goal our last man was caught in possession and you expect to get punished and they worked extremely hard for their chances
8025257 we had chances we hit the bar twice and had a stonewall penalty turned down but its not a night for excuses they got though and good luck to them
8025258 im not too downhearted we have to just get on with it we are in the premier league and looking forward to it
8025259 i think we have played exceptionally well in our two games in the top flight so far and im looking forward to saturday

8025265 im asking people to step up to the plate and when they get their chance to go and take it ive got to say that from one to 11 tonight they all performed
8025266 it shows that we have a very strong squad of players here and competition brings out the quality in people
8025267 i thought luciano becchio led the line fantastically and that some of the combinations in the middle of the park and some of the movement in the final third was excellent
8025268 quite honestly we couldnt cope with the front lads once the second goal went in it was disappointing to say the least
8025269 if you defend like that youre going to get beat against any level of opposition and i thought the two centre forwards bullied our defenders from start to finish
8025270 im not used to coming to leeds and losing i usually enjoy coming here and putting one over on them but they thoroughly deserved it

8025280 our eight year national nightmare of mendacity mediocrity and economic misery with millions of americans losing their jobs their savings their homes and their hopes will soon end
8025281 dispel eight years of pain and shame barack obama is his name call roll
8025282 the first thing i really noticed was at civic center park when i was in the food not bombs area
8025283 i was planning to march with the group that night
8025284 the group first gathered outside the city county building getting ready to march but the police blockaded us
8025285 we moved to the sidewalk a few people stayed in the street because we didnt want a confrontation but it didnt matter
8025286 people started pleading let me go i want to go home
8025287 we asked why we were being detained but they wouldnt talk to us they told us to sit down and we sat down
8025288 then they said that anyone with a photo i d could show it and be let out of the circle and anyone without i d would be arrested i saw a handful of people hold up their i d and police walked up to them grabbed them and took them out i dont know if they were arrested
8025289 they set up an arrest squad two police per protester and talked about who to pick get this one with the bandana or get that one in the black they were targeting individuals
8025290 the arrest process was the two officers picked you up searched you took your bag and everything except your money
8025291 then i was taken to another area loaded onto a bus that took us to a warehouse in a denver industrial park
8025292 they pumped in cold air in these big white tubes all night and all day the next day it was freezing in there i was lucky i had a jacket but other people were in shorts and t shirts we asked them to turn off the cold air but they didnt
8025293 eventually they put all of us in metal leg shackles and re handcuffed us in pairs with our right hands together right hand to right hand so it was difficult to move
8025294 they gave us sandwiches baloney or peanut butter and jelly and there was water in a big jug in each cage
8025295 we were utterly confused we did not understand why we were being detained we hadnt been read our miranda rights we didnt know what wed done to merit such a violent response or why the special operations police were needed
8025296 after they shackled us they put us in a van with no windows and took us to the courthouse where we were supposed to speak with a judge to hear the charges against us
8025297 the attorney explained we had three choices plead guilty and post a 300 bond 500 if you were from out of state or accept a plea bargain that dropped all the charges but one that you had to pay 141 for or plead not guilty and either post your own bail or wait in jail til your court date
8025298 then they walked us out of the courthouse and we saw another group from the protest walking in we were the first group to meet with a judge and a lawyer
8025299 then they took us back to the warehouse the only place to sleep was on a chair if you got one or on the concrete floor
8025300 i was really worried because i could not get any responses from the police
8025301 in the cells we talked to each other about where we were from the places wed been and if wed been in situations before we reassured each other of our rights made sure everyone knew the peoples law project hotline number and that it was really important to get names and badge numbers
8025302 then the bus took us to the city jail the one out on smith road
8025303 i got out on tuesday around noon we learned we were the first wave of protesters to make it all the way through the process 7 p m last night to noon today mobile alerts

8025307 investigations by unama found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men
8025308 the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations
8025309 under international law and national law in afghanistan there should be better coordination with the afghan government to protect the traditions and lives of our people
8025310 were going to stay the course and go on as we have
8025311 nato forces that are operating in afghanistan take every precaution to try to avoid innocent civilian casualties
8025312 and you need to stand that in stark contrast with the militants and the taliban in afghanistan which put innocent civilians in harms way to try to prevent nato from taking the action thats necessary to stop them
8025313 the people can be assured this is the polices job
8025314 it is my order to him to be soft and gentle ask them to come out soft and gentle they want a spark they want someone to hit someone when they hear just one shot they say we won
8025315 the governments endurance has come to an end the government has been patient and gentle all the time i would like to tell the people who are out there if you dont want yourself or your family to be in trouble please go home
8025316 if you want me to leave you will have to kill me and take my body out of here
8025317 all 150 of us were rounded up for a short while before police arrived and talked them down to the ground floor
8025318 senator clintons speech and president clintons speech wednesday will be significant statements about the future of the democratic party and the importance of the election of barack obama
8025319 as the republicans whine outside in their pathetic display of support for the bush mccain agenda our historic convention is moving along full steam ahead
8025320 i dont think the bush administration understands what ordinary americans are going through
8025321 you see barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to
8025322 you see thats just not how he sees the world he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future he knows that that thread is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
8025323 when evaluating the information to be included please remember we are looking to identify significant historic or scientific qualities that make these areas special unique and worthy of additional protection or recognition
8025324 to put it in more simplistic terms we are looking to identify the wow factor for each of these sites
8025325 we rely on fishing as a source of food and jobs
8025326 those who live in the cnmi have no interest in ceding their cultural heritage to the federal government under the auspices of environmental protectionism
8025327 this is an opportunity for president bush to do something really good that will be looked at as a high point of his administration if he does it right
8025328 by right i mean he gives big broad protections and full protections around these islands and atolls not postage stamp protections
8025329 it would be one of the most significant environmental achievements of any u s president
8025330 it could be any location because one facility is now processing flight data for everybody

8025338 howard industries runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for jobs
8025339 it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
8025340 its a real contradiction between our proclaimed values of hard work and family in mississippi and the actions of local law enforcement and ice i think its a real affront to our values theyre creating their own terrorism by going after workers
8025341 by any yardstick it was another rough quarter for bank earnings but the results were not unexpected as the industry coped with financial market disruptions the housing slump worsening economic conditions and the overall downturn in the credit cycle
8025342 scientists have 10 years at the most to find a solution or theres not going to be a citrus industry in florida

8025344 what we hope to find is four or five brass bullets but weve got to hurry because i dont want to find a solution for a dead industry

8025382 we want this to be true to the game of baseball
8025383 we dont want our bat to suddenly change the parameters of the game we want to fit comfortably in those parameters and i think we will
8025384 i accepted i was not major league caliber at that point
8025385 the result is that it is very strong and as a result of it being strong it is very safe

8025396 hes a veteran a laid back guy and we play at a different level we like to run and do all those kinds of things we were just looking for a little different thing thats probably why it didnt work out here
8025397 we are told that barack obama believes too much in an america of high principle and bold endeavor but when john kennedy called of going to the moon he didnt say its too far to get there we shouldnt even try our people answered his call and rose to the challenge and today an american flag still marks the surface of the moon yes we are all americans this is what we do we reach the moon we scale the heights i know it ive seen it ive lived it and we can do it again
8025398 ive discussed with barack several nuances and details that he put in his program for space
8025399 the space program is the symbol of this nations technological prowess and barack understands that just as john kennedy understood it
8025400 but they always had holes or were damaged never had we found a whole tomb like this one intact
8025401 weve been doing the disaster recovery survey annually for the past four years and this year we expanded the list of countries we surveyed
8025402 this was the first year that we added virtualization questions into the mix since that technology is clearly changing a lot of the ways that people are looking at the disaster recovery plans
8025403 clearly companies cannot consider their disaster recovery plan as something they can put on the shelf and let it collect dust
8025404 the number one reason that dr tests fail is that people dont do what they are supposed to do
8025405 weve seen that organizations that use automation can reduce this risk
8025406 information technologies are getting more integral to how people do business
8025407 in the past for example e mail was something that was nice to have but it wouldnt ruin the business if it went down now e mail and messaging are tier one applications for many organizations
8025408 virtualization is forcing folks to take a hard look at what they were doing in the past
8025409 we are seeing rather than minor tweaks more of an overall redesign of the total it environment
8025410 newspaper editors use of those two criteria to select stories for publication has become so ingrained after 400 years of analog technology that few editors or newspaper executives are able to fathom any other possible or apt practices for story selection moreover they came to believe that producing a common edition for everyone is their reason for being forgetting it arose as a limitation of their technology
8025411 a partially complete story that informs the public now is more valuable than a complete story later
8025412 more than 1 4 billion people have gravitated online because they are using access to it plus older portions of the cornucopia such as niche magazines topical television channels and even now cherry picking parts of newspapers web sites to satisfy their own uniquely individual mixes of common group and specific interests better than can any newspaper editors guesses of what interest them can
8025413 the money was supposed to go towards our vacation but we probably lost that much in the casinos
8025414 whether were together or not in 10 years 20 years 40 years well have the magazine layout to look at and remember some incredible sex filled times
8025415 t he most dangerous candidate ever to run for the white house
8025416 this is not a traditional concerto that sets up a contest or contrast between the soloist and the orchestra
8025417 its a memorial piece like bergs violin concerto and the orchestras role is to create a sense of vast space its as if the violin is travelling through this space as it sings
8025418 we plain ran out of time the android bluetooth api was pretty far along but needs some clean up before we can commit to it for the sdk
8025419 the comments are unlikely to be taken as an innocent mistake by those democrats who continue to be angry with the former president for they say not supporting the illinois senator wholeheartedly if not implicitly undercutting him
8025420 most probably crashed thats why we are concentrating our search within a 20 mile radius
8025421 it was to be expected that the leipzig trade fair would try to keep the topic in its 2009 programme as well by announcing its date
8025422 but they will have to do it without the industry for the most part the lead trade fair will take place in cologne in 2009 and beyond
8025423 whatever happens in germany in 2009 outside of cologne cannot claim to represent this sector
8025424 most indications are that gustav will be an extremely dangerous hurricane in the northwestern caribbean sea in a few days
8025425 we had to leave the house before it got worse
8025426 i knew it was coming but i was hoping to be out before it came
8025427 no more tax breaks for big oil companies invest this money in clean energy sources like solar and wind instead
8025428 big oil earned 236 per american driver in the last year
8025429 with climate change and globalisation the ageing of the population is one of the major challenges europe must face
8025430 from 2015 onwards deaths would outnumber births and population growth due to natural increase would cease
8025431 positive net migration would be the only population growth factor however from 2035 this positive net migration would no longer counterbalance the negative natural change
8025432 my friends we spent 3 million of your money to study the dna of bears in montana now i dont know if that was a paternity issue or a criminal issue
8025433 but the point is it was 3 million of your money
8025434 a lot of it is religious language and he would abbreviate common phrases with one letter so righteousness would become an r wickedness would become a w so seeing how severely he was abbreviating things was quite helpful
8025435 the interesting thing about the journal is what you get is a raw unedited version of things
8025436 when history is written it is largely based on a sanitised version shorthand is a way of storing away information
8025437 this is a warts and all portrait of what was happening on the ground its the eerie privilege of peering over the shoulder of one long dead and looking into their world it is in many ways an ordinary diary wesley was quite often depressed about things and you see him struggling in depression and you see his faults as well as his strengths and virtues
8025438 there was a suspicion of lay preaching and methodism was frowned upon by the established church
8025439 my brother and i having promised each other that we would neither of us marry or take any step towards it without the others knowledge and consent
8025440 he john is insensible of both his own folly and danger and of the divine goodness in so miraculously saving him
8025441 sally is slowly recovering her strength after her miscarriage last week
8025442 how far it was occasioned by our late affliction i cannot say but my brother has cast poison into the cup of temporal blessings and destroyed as far in him lay all future usefulness to the church
8025443 has definitely had conversations with microsoft about doing a new halo game and is very excited at the prospect
8025444 action not words action for the many not the few action for hard working families needing desperate relief bold action difficult long term decisions
8025445 dogs bark cats miaow and the labour party puts up taxes
8025446 i think we have to accept that exclusivity is not a thing of the past but it is probably with publishers
8025447 level 5 also did nintendos professor layton for the ds
8025448 i dont think sony can snap up level 5 because believe it or not they have been a lot more succesful on nintendo platforms than with sony
8025449 were going to have less 3rd party exclusives because its getting too expensive to keep them exclusive
8025450 there are plenty of companies who are willing to make 360 exclusives because ms has a system that the masses enjoy unlike sony
8025451 there are plenty of companies who are willing to make 360 exclusives because ms has a system that the masses enjoy unlike sony
8025452 christ but the truth of the matter is that there are some core sony franchises that people associate with sony that have steadily defected to the 360 and in some cases the wii as well over the last few years
8025453 this coming from the company who just flushed all their ps2 profits down the drain with the ps3
8025454 we still have developers working on popular core gaming franchises but we need longer to complete these games approximately two to three years
8025455 how many hoola hoops can you keep going at the same time
8025456 hey i already have a wii but i can now afford a second or maybe even a third console
8025457 thats it im done no more for this gamer the logic of having to wait 2 to 3 more years for a good game is absolutely batshit crazy

8025479 pirate why do you have a steering wheel in your pants

8025481 it shingles occurs in all age groups but it increases in incidence slowly and the curve starts to increase more rapidly somewhere around age 50
8025482 and then the increase gets steeper and steeper as you get older and older
8025483 given that the risk of having at least one reactivation to herpes zoster is 15 per cent to 20 per cent there are likely a significant number of zoster cases occurring each year in canada
8025484 that suggests that whether or not chickenpox vaccine causes an increase that there might have been an increase even without that

8025488 i hope the obama people are not counting on this speech to heal the obama clinton voter rift
8025489 those people hillary cant solve it for em only obama can solve the problem that hes got with them they voted for her because they like her and because they developed a problem with him remember he begins to lose primaries when he is on the verge of becoming the nominee his problem is his problem and not one she can solve
8025490 is there something she can do to tell women and lunchpail democrats to go to him
8025491 the people were talking about here older white blue collar voters theyve got a problem with him and shes not going to be able to solve it for them the obama campaign is fooling themselves if they think shes going to be able to do that tonight
8025492 were here to say thank you to hillary and to protest the fraud perpetrated on us by the democratic national committee
8025493 it wasnt a contest it was a foregone conclusion they the dnc leadership just decided that barack obama was going to win
8025494 its going to be the first time since 1976 that i havent voted i just dont trust obama i think hell do more harm than good
8025495 were here to tell the democratic leadership that its not okay to ignore 18 million voices
8025496 i dont trust obama he flip flops all the time we dont know anything about his past how do we know hes not some kind of militant im voting for mccain
8025497 theres a lot of us who feel pissed and angry at the party for the way hillary was treated there was a lot of sexism in the media and the whole process seemed rigged against her
8025498 at the moment i dont know who i am voting for i want to be able to forgive barack obama but what happened to hillary bugs me i dont know though that i could bring myself to vote for a republican
8025499 i was unhappy and upset that she lost but im going to be voting for obama in november
8025500 hes a brilliant leader and we have to have unity in the party to win the election
8025501 im disappointed hurt and angry about hillary but im not deluded
8025502 four more years of a bush presidency under mccain would be a disaster for our country
8025503 were not going to shoot ourselves in the foot in november hillary rocks but any true democrat will vote for obama
8025504 this was an endlessly fascinating process already and its still got some twists and turns between now and november
8025505 but underneath that and in the background there is also a different story which we dont want to unearth much on the convention floor because its not really what were trying to do but which you should be mindful of
8025506 it seems to me everyone in the world should be obsessed with this
8025507 this is not an easy choice but this is the only chance to save peoples lives
8025508 we expect russia to live up to its international commitments reconsider this irresponsible decision and follow the approach set out in the cease fire deal
8025509 we will have to react somehow to react of course in a military way
8025510 russia is making i would say a number of irrational decisions
8025511 we hope that they hear the loud voices from the international community and understand that its not in their long term interests to take these kinds of actions
8025512 the only place these people want to be is home and they cant go home because of what has happened to them
8025513 must understand that its violations of international law carry consequences
8025514 we obviously cant allow what russias done to go without there being some consequences
8025515 the next president must bring to office a clear eyed view of our nations role in the world as the defender of the oppressed and a force for peace
8025516 in the end confusion about such questions only invites more trouble violence and aggression
8025517 now i missed a few years of the cold war as a guest of one of our adversaries but as i recall the world was deeply divided during the cold war between the side of freedom and the side of tyranny
8025518 the cold war ended not because the world stood as one but because the great democracies came together bound together by sustained and decisive american leadership
8025519 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
8025520 if he really thinks that by liberating iraq from a dangerous tyrant america somehow set a bad example that invited russia to invade a small peaceful and democratic nation then he should state it outright
8025521 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias

8025523 his name and what he achieved its so far out of any players reach in his time or any player who has played since its almost like he played a different game to what were playing

8025525 the worlds spiritual home of cricket don being by far the best cricketer of all time
8025526 it will not only be the bradman museum but it will be the international cricket hall of fame whose captain will be don bradman and the team will be obviously the best
8025527 the initial team of 12 people will be from all over the world i dont know exactly who they will be but they will include people like sachin tendulkar from india
8025528 as the hall of the fame is implemented we will be setting up to embrace the other cricket nations like india and pakistan
8025529 he gave australia pride and hope at a time when through the depression and wwii we really needed it
8025530 we had a tiny population then and the fact that he could go out and be the worlds best gave a lot of hope to australia
8025531 i think its one of the reasons why australia does so well in sport now we can approach any sport and challenge the worlds best we dont feel diffident we dont feel that we cant win at any sport that we do
8025532 i actually have a letter from him where he talks about fame being his unsought companion all his years and thats how he felt a very modest man

8025537 master of my destiny means i control what goes on in my life
8025538 if im a great man if im a superstar if im what i want to be its because i achieved it if im a bum if im something bad then its because i allowed it to happen every decision i make in my life is all mine
8025539 being a good man having good morals and being a great person thats what it means
8025540 every time i get down or feel good i look down on my arms and know this is the reason im here
8025541 i have the power to change how i feel whatever im doing in my life
8025542 im a huge critic of myself when i got hurt i got down a little bit
8025543 i was all worried about not being able to come back and play at the level i can
8025544 that negative talk is the worst thing you can do
8025545 i credit myself on being the most positive person in my life talking myself up knowing i can do whatever i want
8025546 it was a lot of hard work getting back but it was worth all the pain and stuff i went through in the offseason to get here
8025547 i think weve still got a lot of stuff to prove
8025548 a lot of people think its going to be a one year wonder and that drives us kansas has never been to a bowl two years in a row and thats something were looking to do as far as the chip on the shoulder i think its still there

8025556 what it is the same bunch of criminals that are perpetuating imperialist aggression and war with the same devastating consequences directed against the people the war is a war against the people
8025557 people who think that are looking for a way to avoid acknowledging how bad things are so this is an opportunity for them the people who are in the thick of how bad things are dont say that the gap in between the wealthy and the poor living in the united states is greater now than at any time since the depression so the people saying those things must be on that end of being benefited they are not on the end of being stomped on
8025558 its a slogan and if people were just going off the slogan then they were wrong
8025559 its not two parties theyre two sides of a coin
8025560 i do not foresee any improvement in these issues for at least a year
8025561 declared him medically fit to run for political office and free of any symptoms
8025562 you have got to understand that while he was in prison on charges that were never proven there were attempts to kill him
8025563 at that time he was surrounded by fear all the time
8025564 in fact many people were very impressed to see mr zardari go through the trauma of the assassination of benazir bhutto but still hold himself together hold his family especially his children close to him at this very difficult time

8025696 federal law enforcement is working hand in glove with the aurora police department because this matter is currently under investigation there is little we can say right now

8025699 the number of people without health insurance coverage decreased to 45 7 million people in 2007
8025700 generally what the report shows is that there has been some change but its pretty minor
8025701 this isnt progress the changes are insignificant and we would need to see this happen for 10 years to say there has been progress
8025702 you have to remember that the numbers in the report are from last year this year americans have been faced with record high petrol prices and rising food prices unemployment is also up meaning fewer americans have access to employer health benefits
8025703 in 2006 the number of poor elderly people would be higher by 12 6 million people if social security payments were excluded from money income more than quadrupling the number of poor elderly

8025709 axon is a global leader in its field we believe there is room for a counter bid closer to 700p a share

8025711 we are in the process of setting up the pension venture with hsbc there will be only two shareholders in the venture bocom and hsbc
8025712 in the second half of this year we will adjust and improve the structure of our loan clients and monitor the potential risk of assets more closely
8025713 this is a continuation of a story where weve showed strong growth for the last few years for oil services such as us its about customer spending and theres no sign of that slowing overall our markets are robust and the demand for our services remains high we expect the strong growth to continue and believe results for the year will be ahead of expectations
8025714 the strength of the share price into the results suggests a positive announcement was anticipated even so valuation remains very attractive in our view and we expect only positive news from wood group going forward

8025717 very well i concede that i was the woman you saw in the fountain i thought i was unobserved it was careless of me

8025719 of course they would and who could blame them a reputation dies all too easily as you must know major falconer
8025720 so why are you different why did you admit it
8025721 i am not different i do not wish you to be the ruin of my reputation major falconer but equally i know that you saw me so what can i say
8025722 i was bathing you saw me it would avail me little to pretend otherwise so i must rely on your behaviour as a gentleman and hope you will not speak out

8025724 the dollar has been in a bear trend since 2002 that is now reversing and we are now embarking on a four to five year dollar bull market the pound will probably be supported at its current level of around 1 83 for a while but next year we forecast it will drop to the 1 65 to 1 70 level
8025725 could i see it down at 1 50 or below by 2011 certainly i could in any case a 2 pound looks to be gone for at least the next five years
8025726 the last six or seven weeks have finally seen that gordian knot of whether to worry about inflation or growth sliced there has been a dramatic turnaround in energy prices and there is this growing sense that inflationary worries are starting to recede into the background
8025727 sterling has a history of falling very sharply against the dollar
8025728 it did so in the early 1980s and 1990s so it would not surprise me if it dropped significantly however we expect it will bottom out at around 1 75 the long run average price of sterling against the dollar is 1 64 as of yet we are still above that
8025729 the fallout of the credit crisis will continue to dampen the global economy over the next 24 months with sharply escalated oil and food prices beginning to test inflation expectations
8025730 this presents huge socio political as well as economic risks in the next three to five years opportunities may be limited in such a scenario
8025731 would put more pressure on the treasury to explicitly back the liabilities of the gses
8025732 the treasury would opt for one of the earlier options to avoid
8025733 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
8025734 we feel that it is far from inconceivable that we would see an average of 100 banks fail in the us a year for the next three years
8025735 higher and rising inflation is having an effect on pay negotiations in the private sector but pressure on profits is also a key part of the picture as the economic outlook worsens

8025789 grande fue la sorpresa al saberse la noticia de la derrota chilena recib mosla con frialdad y sepamos sacarle su utilidad
8025790 creer dice que los chilenos empezaron el match de manera magn fica no es verdad el error consisti precisamente en la prisa y la impulsividad gastadas en ese primer tiempo es una de las causales de la derrota los chilenos somos precipitados salimos a toda m quina pero paramos de repente sin motivo y como asustados de nosotros mismos no tenemos medida ni para beber ni para trabajar ni para divertirnos queremos hacerlo todo de golpe hasta extenuarnos hay cosas en nuestro temperamento que celebramos como buenas cualidades siendo as que son defectos

8025797 well just let the record speak for itself but it is coming out on election day
8025798 weve done a little bit of the campaign for this record already where we came up with this idea because weve liked a couple of viral campaigns that had happened in the past but then we realized we didnt have the money or the time to hire those publicity firms to do it for us

8025819 therefore my dear brothers stand firm let nothing move you always give yourselves fully to the work of the lord because you know that your labor in the lord is not in vain
8025820 what do we do when if we get to heaven
8025821 the major problem is that if everything is perfect then all the things we consider good lose their impact if nobody is in trouble then kindness is unnecessary if nobody loses then winning is meaningless all that remains is perfect manners at all times and that seems a little stifling
8025822 everything is perfect in heaven then all things we consider good will lose their impact
8025823 it will be so different from what we experience here that it is not possible to express in terms we can understand whilst still in our human bodies
8025824 everyone should be quick to listen slow to speak and slow to become angry
8025825 stick and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me
8025826 the tongue is also a fire a world of evil among the parts of the body it corrupts the whole person sets the whole course of his life on fire and is itself set on fire by hell
8025827 out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks matthew 12 34b
8025828 one of these days you are going to die on the bowling lane
8025829 and now these three remain faith hope and love but the greatest of these is love
8025830 love is patient love is kind it does not envy it does not boast it is not proud it is not rude it is not self seeking it is not easily angered it keeps no record of wrongs love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth it always protects always trusts always hopes always perseveres love never fails
8025831 the lord is my shepherd i shall not be in want he makes me lie down in green pastures he leads me beside quiet waters he restores my soul he guides me in paths of righteousness for his names sake
8025832 therefore jesus said again i tell you the truth i am the gate for the sheep
8025833 for where your treasure is there your heart will be also
8025834 do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven where moth and rust do not destroy and where thieves do not break in and steal for where your treasure is there your heart will be also
8025835 the love of money is the root of all evil
8025836 was just thinking now it is not money that could make me feel fulfilled it is the thought of being able to use money wisely i e according to gods will and being able to help others with my extra money
8025837 i am the vine you are the branches if a man remains in me and i in him he will bear much fruit apart from me you can do nothing
8025838 who needs god when i already have the human capacities and the powerful network to pursue what needs to be done
8025839 god opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble
8025840 when pride comes then comes disgrace but with humility comes wisdom
8025841 do not take revenge my friends but leave room for gods wrath for it is written it is mine to avenge i will repay says the lord
8025842 being kind to your enemies just so you will heap burning coals on his head i found this a huge contradiction in itself isnt this a little hypocritical aint true kindness supposed to come from your heart and not because itll bring your enemies to hell
8025843 if your enemy is hungry feed him if he is thirsty give him something to drink
8025844 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado

8025850 be the change you want to see in the world
8025851 if women want any rights more than theys got why dont they just take them and not be talking about it
8025852 whatever is true whatever is noble whatever is right whatever is pure whatever is lovely whatever is admirable if anything is praise worthy think about such things
8025853 you have heard that it was said eye for an eye and tooth for tooth but i tell you do not resist an evil person if someone strikes you on the right cheek turn to him the other also and if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic let him have your cloak as well if someone forces you to go one mile go with him two miles

8025868 yell out that you love them at the top of your lungs and dont worry if their parents are right there
8025869 dont do things like have smelly green sneakers you might get attention but attention aint the same thing as love
8025870 one way is to take the girl out to eat make sure its something she likes to eat french fries usually works for me
8025871 just see if the man picks up the check thats how you can tell if hes in love
8025872 lovers will just be staring at each other and their food will get cold
8025873 romantic adults usually are all dressed up so if they are just wearing jeans it might mean they used to go out or they just broke up

8025881 some lovers might be real nervous so they are glad that they finally got it out and said it and now they can go eat
8025882 i know one reason that kissing was created it makes you feel warm all over and they didnt always have electric heat or fireplaces or even stoves in their houses
8025883 you can have a big rehearsal with your barbie and ken dolls
8025884 you learn it right on the spot when the gooshy feelings get the best of you
8025885 its never okay to kiss a boy they always slobber all over you thats why i stopped doing it
8025886 if its your mother you can kiss her any time but if its a new person you have to ask permission
8025887 i look at kissing like this kissing is fine if you like it but its a free country and nobody should be forced to do it
8025888 spend most of your time loving instead of going to work
8025889 dont forget your wifes name that will mess up the love
8025890 be a good kisser it might make your wife forget that you never take out the trash
8025891 dont say you love somebody and then change your mind

8025894 so here s the solution to raise great kids focus on your marriage there are three keys to a successful marriage and family 1 recognize that we ve already chosen the perfect spouse no we would not choose better next time 2 recognize how often our fight or flight instinct overrides our passion in marriage to create a happy marriage we need to go from the fantasy it s his her fault that i m unhappy to the truth i wouldn t do any better in my next marriage so i might as well give 100 percent to this one and 3 recognize that if we build a great marriage we create a great role model for our kids and they learn self reliance and cooperation in the process
8025895 scientists have discovered that couples begin to grow fed up with each other after just four years and are at peak risk of divorce just before their fifth anniversary researchers in the us russia and scandinavia investigating the longevity of relationships found that the honeymoon period lasts for less than five years with most divorces likely to happen between five and 10 years into the marriage if couples get through this patch then the chances are theyll stay together indefinitely
8025896 to assess both their causes and their human and policy consequences
8025897 rather than visiting the same familiar haunts and dining with the same old friends couples need to tailor their date nights around new and different activities that they both enjoy says arthur aron a professor of social psychology at the state university of new york at stony brook

8025935 chris jericho is the single greatest thing on any wrestling show right now

8025938 this shawn michaels chris jericho feud is borderline unwatchable i get it they hate each other just fight already

8025941 the chinese have destroyed all his papers his passport everything
8025942 so were not sure what happens when he gets to san francisco
8025943 we are also deeply shocked and anguished to hear of the atrocities and violence meted out to the innocent christians and churches in orissa as a backlash of the sorrowful event
8025944 and we are praying for an immediate halt to the violence
8025945 what is most disturbing is that these attacks seem to be well organized and orchestrated
8025946 we have reports that the vhp have actually held strategy meetings in order to plan and coordinate this campaign of violence against peaceful christian families and churches
8025947 we thank god that the government officials are protecting our bible college campus and trying to protect our people
8025948 and now there is great tension prevailing and christians are running away for their lives
8025949 we must pray with all earnestness for the suffering church in orissa at this time

8025966 its becoming time to give some credit to the in ring efforts of mark henry
8025967 the worst thing about tonight was the rhodes dibiase defeat at the hands of cena
8025968 edge vs undertaker is the current match of the year and i dont get how anybody can say otherwise
8025969 was it just me or was cenas application of the stfu really sloppy and unbelievable
8025970 im so tired of reading rave reviews for edge who has rapidly become not just the most overrated
8025971 the angle styles match was fine until the overwrought overbooked finish
8025972 jericho being thrown into a match with kane for no reason halts the momentum from the months of great character building

8025980 we mourn and lament this tragic assault on reason and justice in india the killing of saraswati and his associates is deplorable to the christian community but the response of the vhp to attack innocent christians is sickening
8025981 the government must act now to protect those who are most vulnerable the current number and distribution of security forces in orissa is nothing like enough to deal with the problem we appeal to the prime minister of india to lead a delegation to meet the victims as a matter of urgency we appeal to the international community to raise their voices to bring peace in an area where more people will die unless something is done urgently
8025982 we condemn both the murder of saraswati and his associates and the horrific attacks which have taken place subsequently and send our sincere condolences to the innocent victims of violence in orissa
8025983 these incidents send a tragic signal that large parts of orissa are not under the rule of the law but under mob justice
8025984 we urge the indian government and orissa state government to bring a decisive end to the cycle of terrible violence by restoring order and protecting the vulnerable christian communities who have become the scapegoats the current violence must be urgently brought to an end and then we will look to the orissa government to deliver prosecutions of the perpetrators to compensate the victims properly and to demonstrate to the world that the rule of law does still apply in india
8025985 address the widespread allegations included those made by the national commission of minorities of incitement to violence by hindu extremist groups specifically the vhp and its local leader swami lakhmananda saraswati and ensure that any extremist religious groups found to be complicit in inciting violence are banned in orissa state
8025986 i am also pleased by his support of vouchers for catholic schools like brophy
8025987 catholic priests should pray for anyone and everyone but i dont think we should endorse or campaign for political candidates
8025988 i believe the best forum for voters to see the candidates in their work clothes is in a debate
8025989 the debate format presents the opportunity for the candidates to not only

8026001 unfortunate events have taken place in orissa in recent days
8026002 i appeal to the governing authorities in india to intervene to save the lives of the many who are being victimized in the current crisis

8026167 did anything come up through the floor stay in the car while i go see what we hit
8026168 i dont know how it stayed in the well like that
8026169 i felt it pounding around in there right behind my seat
8026170 i thought it was going to come right through the car
8026171 so now i go up that exit ramp and see if that gas station has a tow truck dave why dont you come with me and tom you stay here with mom and jim
8026172 i dont want to pull it on that bad wheel
8026173 its pert near off already likely drop right out when we lift er up so step back
8026174 i dont know i was thinking the same thing but its been over a year ago since dad replaced the u joint besides this wasnt the drive shaft it was the axel and dont forget moms been driving this car for a year without us shes awful hard on cars
8026175 in the morning hes going to take me to the junk yard to get the parts we need and let me do the repairs myself

8026178 i liked it better than the other one they had
8026179 a previously unknown indian hacker successfully breached the it defenses of the best western hotel groups online booking system and sold details of how to access it through an underground network operated by the russian mafia
8026180 we have found no evidence to support the sensational claims ultimately made by the reporter and newspaper
8026181 most importantly whereas the reporter asserted the recent compromise of data for past guests from as far back as 2007 best western purges all online reservations promptly upon guest departure
8026182 there was one instance of suspicious activity at a single hotel with respect to 13 guests who are being notified we are working with the fbi and international authorities to investigate the source of the other claims which were never presented to us for investigation prior to publication of the herald story we have found no suspicious activity to support them
8026183 some guy wrote a poem about pumpin gas to a mouse
8026184 no thats the poems name but come to think of it yes he wrote it to a mouse that he accidently dug up with a plow it was nesting underground like that little one we found when we were laying the sewer pipe with dad were you with us the day that happened
8026185 nope ida remembered a thing like that was it dead
8026186 we thought so at first he was curled up in a ball dave picked it up and it scared us when it moved real slow like it was coming out of a coma then dad explained that it had been hibernating in its little nest below the frost line it was still groggy when dave put it back down on the ground
8026187 we kept digging the sewer line and it crawled off into the trees like it was sleep walkin
8026188 seems like you should have killed it what if that same mouse gets in the house some day mom hates mice
8026189 then we would kill it because it would be in our space but at that moment we had broken his space
8026190 theres a book by john steinbeck called of mice and men and the title comes from that poem im not sure why it would be another two years before i would actually read of mice and men and know why the title was perfect anyway i guess i thought of the poem because this trip has not gone the way dad planned
8026191 the owner had to go back to the junk yard to get dad one more part so he asked dad if he minded tending the station til he got back theres nothing we can do on the car until then
8026192 i guess i offered to pump gas but he said hed better stick to what clee set up its kind of weird i mean the guy left dad in charge of the place theres nobody else there right now but dad told me to come back and tell mom it will be another hour or so
8026193 i can turn the channels and everything from right here
8026194 here take him a bucket of ice your husbands over there workin in the heat poor mans going to want a shower before you hit the road and the boys look like theyre enjoying the pool just keep the room key no hurry were mostly empty anyhow
8026195 im going to take some sandwiches over to dad and then come back to put my feet in what did you find out over there dave is he almost done i feel bad us over here and him working out in this heat
8026196 its okay mom hes just keeping an eye on things til clee gets back
8026197 clee just went to get one more part dad needs its not even gunna cost us because clee says it should have been attached when they bought it dads almost done i was just over there and he sent me back let me take the lunch over to him you just wade your feet really mom everythings just perfect just perfect
8026198 a well youre digging a cistern well all youll get is salt water round here why do you think they call it the salt river
8026199 i didnt need it clee had some free time toward the end and it went fast with his help im going to take a quick shower and change out of this shirt unfortunately i didnt bring another pair of pants but well be home before you know it
8026200 he wont take a penny for everything he did for us not even the tow
8026201 what but he did so much what about the parts
8026202 i paid for the junk yard parts of course but that wasnt bad at all i tried to put the money in his pocket but he wouldnt hear of it
8026203 an leae us nought but grief an pain for promisd joy still thou are blest compared wi me the present only toucheth thee but och i backward cast my ee on prospects drear an forward tho i canna see i guess an fear
8026204 dad told me to tell you boys just to stay here and swim theres nothing you can do over there
8026205 he said if he needs one of you hell come get you so put on your suits and enjoy the pool we dont have to check out until noon
8026206 maybe he has to do that to pay for the repair sort of like washing dishes at a restaurant when you dont have enough to pay
8026207 i cant be swimming over here while dads pumpin gas over there
8026208 dad did say hed call us if he needed us
8026209 and if theres one thing ive learned its to stay away until dad needs me
8026210 because the forerunner was invented by charles moncky in 1858
8026211 you can use tools and not know their names its only when two people are working together or trying to teach that agreeing on the names of things matters sure i know all of his tools and what they do
8026212 now that youre away he calls me to bring him tools but if im not sure which one hes talking about i just ask him
8026213 well sure how else would i know what to bring id ask him which ones the crescent wrench and hed say its an adjustable wrench with a thumb knob that opens and closes to fit the nut bring the big one it says crescent right on the handle not the little red one center of the board to the left of the ball peen hammer like that
8026214 wow jim youve got it made i used to think dad thought boys were born knowing the names of tools
8026215 i started some complicated triple knot with no name and he yelled again just throw a half hitch
8026216 yes i said it dave and i had been working with him all spring break tearing down that building in mt clemens to get the wood to build the house now it was saturday it was late and dark and drizzling we still had to drive out to the property and unload it all in the barn before going home we were all tired and i just kinda snapped
8026217 he said you mean to tell me you dont know how to tie a half hitch he was mad and i said no dad i dont why dont you come over to this side of the trailer and show me a half hitch
8026218 i dont know where i got the courage but i did dad shook his head all the way as if he was about to tie a grown mans shoe but he calmly showed me how to tie a half hitch and explained why it was perfect for this situation he started out sarcastic like how could i have a 16 year old son so ignorant of knots but then doing it step by step like that he mustve remembered the time somebody had shown him how after he was done he took a deep breath looked up at me and said im sorry i never taught you that before now the teeth were gone from his voice and i felt bad for talking back to him
8026219 all you did was ask him to show you i do that all the time
8026220 theres nothing wrong with a question but i asked it just to yell back at him i think i wanted him to feel that way and then when he did i felt like a creep
8026221 thats why im taking dad at his word that hell call us if he needs us
8026222 the mad part i mean hes more like the teach you how part now
8026223 life is the meal god serves while were reading our hand written menus

8026228 pero he recibido tambi n otro tipo de contactos llenos de reproches cargados de odio regados de violencia intolerancia agresi n y con un esp ritu inquisidor que no cre que anidara todav a en gente de mi comunidad he sido amenazado agraviado insultado difamado calumniado y peor a n han sufrido ese tipo de atropello miembros de mi familia no me refiero a los impunes foros de internet sino a e mails cartas y llamados recibidos
8026229 aquellos que piensan que la sra presidenta de mi pa s me paga por verso recital u opini n simplemente est n expresando su propia escala de valores y asumiendo que ellos mismos podr an torcer sus convicciones a un precio determinado yo no
8026230 viste fulano ahora ya no est en contra de cristina
8026231 y claro si la empresa para la que labura arregl con el gobierno
8026232 nunca discuto una cr tica sea como sea y venga de quien venga pero en este caso no recib opiniones sobre la conformaci n est tica del tema de su m trica de sus rimas de sus sonidos de la destreza para ejecutarla sino una violenta y censuradora mirada hacia el contenido de mis ideas y mi conducta bien t pico de tiempos de inquisici n y dictaduras
8026233 basta con esa cuesti n de los derechos humanos basta de juzgar a militares basta de exhibir a hebe de bonafini en cada acto ni a la carlotto nos bancamos ya eso termin es el pasado hay que archivarlo
8026234 hay que juzgar a los guerrilleros o no qued alguno vivo
8026235 se critica a cristina por autoritaria qu otro presidente hubiera soportado cien d as con rutas cortadas desabastecimiento y amenazas constantes sin disparar un solo tiro ni reprimir en ninguno de los cientos de cortes de caminos que hubo entre el 19 y 20 de diciembre de 2001 murieron 31 personas en la represi n del gobierno de de la r a a las manifestaciones populares el matrimonio montonero tuvo la actitud m s tolerante y democr tica frente a las protestas de la ciudadan a que se recuerde en toda la historia argentina
8026236 es ticamente correcto que la clase media y alta de buenos aires salgan a golpear cacerolas por las retenciones del campo cuando jam s las golpearon por las flacas jubilaciones que cobran nuestros viejos ni por los chicos que tienen hambre ni por los sueldos docentes ni por la carpa docente ni por la privatizaci n vergonzosa de nuestras empresas en los 90
8026237 tiene autoridad moral la sociedad rural de pedir m s institucionalidad cuando apoy a cuanto gobierno de facto hubo en la argentina este campo hoy indignado es el mismo que aplaudi a menem a lo largo de la d cada del 90 s es el mismo
8026238 quienes piensan leg timamente que los ruralistas tienen raz n por qu lo expresan a trav s de mails o comentarios tan agresivos tan cargados de odio tan faltos de argumentos racionales qu nos pasa a los argentinos y argentinas que nos cuesta tanto bancarnos a una mujer como presidenta muchos de los adjetivos de esos mails muchos de ellos enviados por mujeres muestran el peor machismo se la llama a cristina puta conchuda turra tilinga y al mismo tiempo los argumentos brillan por su ausencia

8026243 ohhhhhhh its not a water balloon its an air balloon with water in it a decoration on a friends locker sounds like a fool proof plan to me lets get you some more tape
8026244 its cool that youre decorating a friends locker and i appreciate your clarifying that this balloon filled with water is not a water balloon it was a cute little thing about the size of an oblong tennis ball but lets skip the locker part and go straight to that break it in the sink part hows that sound
8026245 if we could always remember to treat people in the present like well wish we had in 20 years it would make us wise beyond our years
8026246 ive been doing a lot of interviews and stage shows and half the questions are like will mgs4 be coming out on 360 or other formats and in the near future i hope theyll ask me about metal gear about us about our future projects and will stop caring about the hardware

8026269 i have actually severed a limb but i will bleed to death before i admit that i am hurt
8026270 it didnt fall into my outstretched hands so im completely clueless
8026271 i have no idea what you just said and am hoping desperately that i can fake it well enough so that you dont find out
8026272 i am used to the way you yell at me and i realize it could be worse
8026273 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8026274 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8026275 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8026276 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8026277 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8026278 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals
8026279 ongoing investigation and yesterdays action was just the first part
8026280 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs
8026281 it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
8026282 makes people happy to see their pictures in the paper

8026284 in order to enter that discussion to carry out ones responsibilities as a citizen one must be informed accurate information will not always come directly from the government but may be offered by an independent source and the maintenance of freedom and democracy depends upon the total independence and fearlessness of such sources

8026286 credits the improvements in iraq to anything but the surge
8026287 i know the surge worked i was there i saw al qaida decimated
8026288 will not stand by and let the incredible progress of our troops go unnoticed by the american public and lawmakers from either side of the aisle
8026289 senator obama has said that he would still oppose the surge if given another opportunity and has pointed to every outside factor but the surge to explain improvements in iraq we hope he will listen to the veterans who have served there and support this important resolution for the sake of the troops
8026290 check your departure airport to see if your flight may be affected
8026291 we have our engineers looking at it and were doing a complete investigation
8026292 thank you so much for sharing with us this valuable piece of information that is in no way extremely obvious and well known by every sentient being in existence and even some non sentient ones such as fruit flies
8026293 he threw 50 pitches and he was strong and hes ready to go friday im excited and because hes excited so are we
8026294 did a real good flat ground session and had a really good bullpen and hes all set to go
8026295 yes we wouldnt let him throw a side until he was symptom free
8026296 well always check with everybody but were pretty comfortable that hes ready to go
8026297 he probably couldve pitched the other day but we always try to do things the right way even when its not easy to do i think were real comfortable backing him up because now he can go out and pitch and not think about it and go out and compete
8026298 obviously you saw we have thurston here and theres a pretty good chance that were going to activate thurston for this game
8026299 mikeys doing real well he did a bunch of core work today and had a strengthening exam with the trainers he wont hit today but if everything goes like they think it will hell hit off the tee tomorrow hes doing very well
8026300 yes i think that hip is going to be sore from time to time just because he has that condition but thats never stopped him from playing or playing well
8026301 i dont think we allow ourselves to get caught up in that
8026302 what makes this place so special i dont think is the building its what happened in this stadium theres so many great players and great teams that have come through here thats what makes this place so special
8026303 any team can erect monuments but the reason those monuments are up is because theyre great players thats no secret
8026304 but were moving what a hundred yards the only difference from where i sit is that their payroll will go up a bunch more and make it harder for us
8026305 even though his numbers are really good for a guy who hasnt picked up a bat in four or five days youre probably not going to see the hitter youre looking for
8026306 as long as it doesnt make the game go too slow i think its good there have been some tough calls this year and theres always going to be tough calls guys are having enough trouble calling outs on the bases and strikes and this and that so to make a call about 100 feet away after someone smokes the ball off the wall i think its a good thing
8026307 there is a lot of pre emptive demolition going on this is already having a visual impact cities are beginning to look like broken teeth
8026308 we are spending public money demolishing buildings to avoid this ill thought out stealth tax
8026309 swindon like many other towns across the country could suffer if regeneration projects are shelved as a result of this
8026310 there is no nation on earth powerful enough to accomplish our overthrow our destruction should it come at all will be from another quarter from the inattention of the people to the concerns of their government from their carelessness and negligence i must confess that i do apprehend some danger i fear that they may place too implicit a confidence in their public servants and fail properly to scrutinize their conduct that in this way they may be made the dupes of designing men and become the instruments of their own undoing
8026311 where does the seeming hate and vitriol of racism come from and what would the world be like if we were all a little bit nicer to each other

8026314 god governs in the affairs of man and if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid we have been assured in the sacred writings that except the lord build the house they labor in vain that build it i firmly believe this i also believe that without his concurring aid we shall succeed in this political building no better than the builders of babel

8026336 nothing more than turning our heart toward god and receiving in turn his love
8026337 silence and solitude are the outward physical manifestations of the inward surrender of the heart
8026338 but w e have not surrendered all else to attend to it alone
8026339 as thou art in church or cell that same frame of mind carry into the world into its turmoil and its fitfulness
8026340 this is actually the first time ive done interviews since ive been here so its actually been kind of nice not to have to deal with all that after being in the la media for five years
8026341 obviously ive got such a ways to go and i think i can get so much better
8026342 but i feel good about what ive done im not satisfied or content with the way things have gone but its a great opportunity for me to be around these coaches and learn from them
8026343 i just want to go out and enjoy it i come out here and enjoy every day there is uncertainty i hope it does work out i hope i can be a part of this but you never know
8026344 obviously they want to give a good accounting of themselves whether they are handing it off or whether they are making a play on a naked bootleg or a screen or a drop back pass
8026345 i just want to see where they are with our system
8026346 theres so much going on and so much that you have to know from audibles fronts coverages everything
8026347 for me getting all the reps in college at sc and then to get here and not get as many thats definitely the biggest challenge for me to overcome
8026348 theres too many what ifs and then youve screwed up what you need to do which is your job
8026349 im good right now like ive said since the spring whatever happens is going to happen ive got a better perspective now i would say
8026350 this guy came into this store just minutes ago he was older than us maybe 60 and he said i would like some real rock records not like the ones the young listen to like the one youre playing now
8026351 i have a lot of good things to say about your mom

8026356 bill clinton knows a little bit about trying to yank the economy out of the doldrums
8026357 it wouldnt make sense for me to want to edit his remarks
8026358 during the course of a 19 month campaign i think that youre on the television screen youre in big auditoriums but sometimes who you are may get lost
8026359 the fact is we had a very hard fought primary there are going to be some of senator clintons supporters we have to work hard to persuade to come on board thats not surprising
8026360 the clintons love this country they love the democratic party and they are going to be active participants in our campaign for the remaining 70 days
8026361 it seems to be a little more of a problem than i anticipated
8026362 all you need is 200 people in that crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
8026363 we need in the white house starting on january 20th barack obama and joe biden
8026364 still doesnt believe that women deserve equal pay for equal work
8026365 he doesnt believe that women deserve the right to choose
8026366 he would turn the clock back when what we need from our president is forward movement more progress the kind of opportunities that we expect for the next generation of americans
8026367 what obama has to have hillary do is stand up and say not only in words but its got to be almost method acting and say it in a way thats believable that she wants barack obama to be president
8026368 frankly goes toward any future political considerations she may have
8026369 even john mccain concedes that we are worse off than we were four years ago
8026370 but you cant expect change from a senator who voted in lockstep with president bush 95 percent of the time
8026371 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
8026372 the republicans are not going to run this convention and cnn is not going to run this convention
8026373 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8026374 we set out last night to make sure that america knew that michelle obama was going to be the kind of first lady that they could all be proud of and that was a lot like them
8026375 all this stuff about mccain and this hitting back hard enough thats all political blah blah
8026376 my inclination is you have to be careful about attacking mccain

8026385 most people do not have an easy way to manage the vast resources of the web to simplify their task at hand
8026386 for the most part they are left trundling between web sites performing common tasks resulting in frustration and wasted time ubiquitys interface goal is to enable the user to instruct the browser by typing speaking using language what they want to do

8026389 being relatively new to the mozilla world we found it difficult and time consuming to write extensions to firefox
8026390 there is something largely last decade about requiring restarts to add a new feature to your browsing experience its ironic that the entire web is on a push model yet the browser the most fundamental tool of interacting with the web is on a pull model the fundamental problem is that extending the browser and hence the web is too difficult the closer new browser functionality can be packaged to look like standard html and javascript the larger and more diverse a community will create it
8026391 its important to understand the dangers of subscribing to ubiquity commands from sites that you dont trust
8026392 since a ubiquity command can do anything and it has full access to your web browser a bad person could write a ubiquity command to steal your personal information or do malicious things to your computer you should not install ubiquity commands unless you are confident that the source is trustworthy in the future well be creating something called a trust network that ubiquity users can use to share knowledge about which commands are trustworthy

8026407 quienes realizan estas acciones son grupos minoritarios la realidad en india no es la de la violencia de estos d as existe una convivencia y un di logo entre las comunidades que se manifiestan en la vida cotidiana estoy convencido de que como en el pasado ser n tambi n los representantes hind es y de las otras confesiones presentes en india las que contribuyan a la reconstrucci n de las obras destruidas
8026408 el di logo es el esp ritu de la india podr parecer absurdo pero es tambi n de estos graves hechos que se puede generar la savia del conocimiento respeto y esfuerzo comunes

8026650 regent media now owns the best known and most respected brands in the gay and lesbian marketplace our brands signify the highest quality content for the lgbt community via television magazines books and the web
8026651 these seminal properties will continue to document and to enrich the culture and history of our nation
8026652 fortium began to recognize that we were their most successful channel to market and we began to realize that we were using their technologies and even augmenting our techniques based on what was in their technology
8026653 i think the agency is at a really neat time
8026654 i think so much has changed in the last two years with publicis
8026655 i think at this moment the agency has grown up in terms of the eyes of partnerships with our clients as digital has become more and more important and clients and companies look to connect their products and services with consumers
8026656 i think what were seeing more than ever is that our clients need quantifiable marketing that connects to consumers and were just energized to be their partners
8026657 i have worked with general motors at digitas and prior for about 13 years now
8026658 i have a very special relationship with general motors and its a really important client for our agency in the us and globally
8026659 idems action has rid the community of a real environmental problem and is helping to make the neighborhood a better place to live and play
8026660 idems priority is protecting hoosiers and our environment and it is a great feeling to be able to come in and make such a large impact on an environmental hazard with the funds we have available
8026661 brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted
8026662 like everything else in life there are times that you have to make an adjustment
8026663 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8026664 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8026665 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to not as long as im the commissioner
8026666 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8026667 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8026668 in this day and age where all these ballparks are being built now where people can reach out over the outfield fence and catch balls fan interference is becoming more and more of an issue
8026669 a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time
8026670 it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times
8026671 thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8026672 i find it very strange that with 30 games to go in the season that they would start it now i find that very peculiar
8026673 if they wanted it so bad what took them so long to get it going and why wait until this particular point in time
8026674 some people thought that we ought to wait until the postseason
8026675 id rather go into the postseason knowing that weve already used it
8026676 so if the game is held up for a couple of minutes a couple of times a year i think thats ok
8026677 its certainly not going to be seen as often as it is in the nfl
8026678 i believe that because of the configuration of ballparks both new and old that calling home runs is really much more difficult than it once was
8026679 i dont believe in the use of instant replay for other things
8026680 i just dont want it to open up pandoras box with calls at home and calls at the bases and eventually behind the plate
8026681 we havent talked about that i think that thats unlikely over the term of this agreement
8026682 what well obviously do is look at it after the world series were hopeful that were going to say it was great
8026683 we talked to the technicians and he explained what theyre going to be doing
8026684 medical apartheid the dark history of medical experimentation on black americans from colonial times to the present
8026685 beyond eating disorders why we need to rethink everything we thought we knew
8026686 the male body a new look at men in public and private
8026687 were really pumped up and were coming out of camp with a pretty good feeling
8026688 it means a lot if they can get the win accomplish a lot by going on the road and getting the win itll add to our confidence
8026689 this game makes us better its demanding of our football team
8026690 i like how this one feels the talk and the build up
8026691 this suits us well to do what we want to do we have to win every game anyway
8026692 he was the most perfect looking guy we saw coming out of high school
8026693 he may have been 300 pounds in sixth grade hes exactly what youre looking for at left tackle

8026695 we are thrilled that this jury sent a strong message that they want these companies to compete in the marketplace and not the courtroom
8026696 mattel has pursued this case first and foremost as a matter of principle
8026697 we have an obligation to defend ourselves against competitors who choose to engage in fraudulent activities against us
8026698 its like you know having dinner with three people for seven years and getting quite bored of each other
8026699 so its having a fourth person new opinion i think its gonna be interesting
8026700 kara has a good reputation of a having hits and b having an opinion and thats a good combination
8026701 concerned about the audience and acceptance time will tell well see
8026702 i know kara and she speaks her mind so she will be speaking her mind
8026703 i wore pajamas the girls wore negligees and we kind of broke the ice
8026704 i liken the changes she made over the years to starting out as a mom and pop candy store and ending up wal mart
8026705 started this whole modernization of the production of braille books
8026706 we used to joke and say once you become a braillist you become an addict it was so much a part of her i think she ate drank and slept braille
8026707 she could sit on the balcony and watch some of the waves and read a book
8026708 they had to leave part of the crew and passengers in the falklands because they couldnt get the tenders back
8026709 all i could think of was that this was her last sunset

8026716 our risk manager said we cant put the skateboard park in unless we put in a fence
8026717 we had some residents led by some young adults who had the desire to have the town install a skateboard park i was aware of the fact old tappan was interested in putting one in as well so i reached out to mayor victor polce and suggested we do it jointly
8026718 the kids from river vale and old tappan can make application for id cards because they will need id cards to use the skatepark

8026727 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired

8026850 and i have every confidence that she will show this country that for her its about america and that means it has to be about barack obama you cannot support hillary clinton and not understand that turning away from barack obama at this point is turning away from everything we believe in

8027034 in a perfectly functioning market housing providers would simply increase production to meet the tremendous demand for what is generally referred to as workforce housing but housing is far from a perfectly functioning market high land and construction costs regulatory barriers and local impact fees make it virtually impossible to build rehabilitate and operate apartments at rents affordable to these workers in any mid to large size metro area
8027035 localities that want workforce housing and developers who want to provide it have to find creative ways to bridge the gap between construction costs and affordable rents
8027036 in some cases that means project subsidies in others it simply requires expedited permitting or density bonuses thats where nmhcs project estimator comes in it functions like a commercial real estate underwriting system and allows users to evaluate the financial viability of a project under different scenarios
8027037 users enter a projects financial pro forma data into the nmhc project estimator they can then apply a wide variety of incentives common in public private partnerships such as tax abatements expedited permitting direct public investment and others to the project to determine what combination is necessary to make the project financially viable
8027038 the first was to help the private sector find ways to meet the growing demand for workforce housing given the tremendous demand for this product there are many firms that would consider moving into the workforce housing market if we can help them figure out how to make the numbers work
8027039 many of the local leaders who now find themselves responsible for solving their communitys housing shortage do not have backgrounds in housing finance because they dont understand the economics of housing they dont understand why some incentives work better than others in various marketplaces the nmhc project estimator will give them a realistic analysis of different incentives and help them determine which ones meet the developers needs as well as the communitys goals
8027040 the nmhc project estimator represents more than a years worth of work
8027041 it has been rigorously tested and we will continue to refine it based on user feedback
8027042 they now exist in urban suburban and rural counties to find affordable housing many workers are being pushed farther and farther from their jobs this is no longer a tenable solution in an era of 4 a gallon gasoline and its not sustainable if we are serious about wanting to reduce our national carbon footprint and tackle climate change the apartment industry is committed to being part of the solution to the workforce housing by creating concrete tools for investors developers and local officials
8027043 it used to be that the world of investing was located in places like new york or chicago now there are no such boundaries we utilize advanced technologies to build personal relationships with our investors and representatives across the country with todays technologies we can also research underwrite and understand potential investments more thoroughly than ever

8027045 were a family owned company from a small town which helps to build trust with our investors we take that trust very seriously
8027046 people its absolutely our people we have an incredible range of talent across the nation representing the best interests of our investors
8027047 that was the most important lesson we learned growing up in a family defined by real estate work with the right people and right people always meant those who put the interests of the investors first who would research a thousand properties and from that number pick one and who would literally walk the floors of every property to make certain it was everything in person that it purported to be on paper
8027048 our investment principles have served us and our investors well because of our geographically diverse portfolio were in a good position to weather the current credit crunch and the multifamily market maintains its potential for growth so well continue to search for properties in communities that show strong economic and demographic growth and pass that potential on to our investors
8027049 weve stayed true to our roots and will remain a part of the community that gave rise to our success the fact that the area has been welcoming visitors for more than a century confirms what we believe the community has something to offer everyone a strong economy with endless natural and recreational resources

8027151 the warfare began aug 7 when georgia launched a barrage targeting south ossetia
8027152 are going to be bored because im going to give some back story that you know better than i do
8027153 a key tool that the soviet union used to keep its empire together
8027154 now the story starts really in 1992 when this fuse was lit in georgia
8027155 now theres two territories theres abkhazia which has clearly defined administrative borders and theres south ossetia that doesnt before the troubles started abkhazia was an extremely ethnically mixed area about 60 percent georgian 20 percent abkhaz and 20 percent assorted others greeks estonians armenians jews what have you in ossetia it was a completely integrated and completely mixed ossetian georgian population the ossetians and the georgians have never been apart in the sense that they were living in their own little villages and doing their own little things there has been inter marriage and a sense of common understanding going back to distant history the georgians will tell you about king tamar thats a woman but they called her a king and she was married to an ossetian so the fuse was lit and two wars start one in abkhazia and one in south ossetia
8027156 it was also lit in tbilisi there was a guy in charge here zviad gamsakhurdia a little bit like serbian nationalist war criminal in bosnia radovan karadzic he was a poet he was an intellectual but he was one of these guys who veered off into ethnic exclusivism he made stupid declarations like georgia is only for the georgians if youre running a multi ethnic country that is really not a clever thing to say the central control of the state was extremely weak the russians were trying to make things worse there was a civil war between georgians and tbilisi but the key thing is that here there were militias georgian militias and some of them pretty nasty
8027157 this guy zviad gamsakhurdia was driven from power from across the street they bombed this place
8027158 theres a horrible picture in my georgia book of this facade
8027159 of course he led the government in exile until he came back in 1993 then died obscurely in the mountains of suicide some people say others say cancer then he was buried in grozny
8027160 things here explode and basically it gets pretty nasty thomas can tell you what happened
8027161 youve got two bits of abkhazia which are not ethnic abkhazia
8027162 the first thing that misha mikheil saakashvili did was try to poke his finger in russian president vladimir putins eyes as many times as possible
8027163 most notably by wanting to join nato the west in my view mishandled this situation america gave the wrong signals so did europe
8027164 but basically the encouragement was given despite stronger and stronger russian signals that a georgian accession to
8027165 just a little bit of back story again in july of 2007 russia withdrew from the conventional forces treaty in europe this is a soviet era treaty that dictates where
8027166 one provocation was to use the russian media to launch shrill accusations that the georgian army was in kodori preparing for an invasion of abkhazia now if you go up there i took a bunch of journalists up there a few times when you get to the actual checkpoint you have a wall of crumbling rock a wooden bridge another wall of crumbling rock a raging torrent and a steep mountainside filled with woods its not possible to invade out or invade in unless youve got air support which is why the abkhaz were never able to kick these georgians out they just kept that bit of territory
8027167 but this time im getting advice from an expert on how im doing
8027168 the next provocation on april 16 putin signs a presidential decree recognizing the documents of abkhazians and south ossetians in russia and vice versa
8027169 starting in mid july the russians launched the biggest military exercise in the north caucasus that theyve held since the chechnya war
8027170 on august 3 the head of the local administration says hes evacuating his civilians
8027171 on top of that for the last four years the russians have been dishing out passports to anyone who asks in those areas
8027172 so back to the 3rd of august kokoity announces women and children should leave as it later turned out he made all the civilians leave who were not fighting or did not have fighting capabilities on the same day irregulars ingush chechen ossetians and cossacks start coming in and spreading out into the countryside but dont do anything they just sit and wait on the 6th of august the shelling intensifies from ossetian positions and for the first time since the war finished in 1992 they are using 120mm guns
8027173 because of the peace agreement they had nobody was allowed to have guns bigger than 80mm okay so thats the formal start of the war it wasnt the attack on tskhinvali now stop me
8027174 all the reports ive read say saakashvili started the war
8027175 saakashvili is accused of starting this war on the 7th
8027176 but that sounds like complete bs to me if what you say is true
8027177 it must be stopped if not today then maybe tomorrow my troops were in our village avnevi on the 6th of august they blew up our troops four wheel drives our pickups they blew them up also in this village it was august 5th or 6th i cant remember they started bombing us with shells two soldiers died that day our peacekeepers the ossetians had a good position on the hill they could see all our positions and our villages and they started bombing they went to the top of the hill bombed us then went down we couldnt see who was shooting at us
8027178 but it started that day from that place when two georgians were killed
8027179 before they started bombing us they took all the civilians out of their villages
8027180 then they started damaging our villages houses a gas pipe roads yards they killed our animals they evacuated their villages then bombed our villages
8027181 but in another village i was fired upon on august 6th on the 5th of august they started shooting they blew up our peacekeeping trucks they put a bomb on the road and when they were driving they were blown up they also mined the roads used by civilians on the 6th of august they started bombing avnevi and at this time they took the civilians out of tskhinvali and sent them to north ossetia inside russia
8027182 they took the civilians kids women and put them on the bus and sent them to north ossetia
8027183 i was running away and the soldiers wounded me they robbed me and shot me in the leg with a kalashnikov i dont know if it was russians or ossetians they took my car took my gold chain and shot me
8027184 they didnt care if it was a house or a military camp
8027185 i saw it it was the russian military airplanes if they knew it was a georgian village they bombed all the houses many civilians were killed from this bombing
8027186 on the 6th while this is going on the integration minister who was until a few months ago an
8027187 on the evening of the 7th the ossetians launch an all out barrage focused on georgian
8027188 what they had in the area was peacekeeping stuff not stuff for fighting a war
8027189 the georgians will tell you that they estimate that these two actions together slowed the russian advance by 24 to 48 hours that is what the world considered to be mishas game and you know why the world considers it that because here in south ossetia was the head of the peacekeeping troops he hasnt been in iraq hes a peace keeper what have they been told for the last four years they lived in a failed state then there was the rose revolution it wasnt perfect but damn now theres electricity theres jobs roads have been fixed and what the georgians have had drummed into them is that georgia is now a constitutional state a state of law and order and everybody here knows that ossetia is a gangsters smugglers paradise the whole world knows it but here they know it particularly well the peacekeepers had a military objective and the first rule of warfare when youre talking to the media is not to reveal to your enemy what youre going to do so they werent going to blather into a microphone and say well actually im trying to go through tskhinvali in order to stop the russians so what did he say instead im here to restore constitutional order in south ossetia and thats it with that georgia lost the propaganda war and the world believes saakashvili started it and the rest of the story you know
8027190 this is your first time to the lands of the former soviet union
8027191 may sound just like a rhetorical flourish with no echo in the american mindset what it means in the post soviet mindset is what boris yeltsin was doing in chechnya this was the stupidest phrase this guy possibly could have used thats why people want to lynch him
8027192 your presentation was deliciously comprehensive perhaps it was well ask our new friend michael too much information out of the gate to absorb
8027193 there are some details that i would chip in who are the ossetians and where do they live this is the question that has been lost in all of the static from this story this autonomy south ossetia is an autonomous district as opposed to an autonomous republic with about 60 000 people max so where are the rest of the ossetians guess where they live tbilisi here there everywhere there are more ossetians take a look around this lobby you will find ossetians here of those ossetians who are theoretically citizens of the republic of georgia 60 000 live there and around 40 000 live here
8027194 are they on the side of those who live in south ossetia
8027195 one of them is georgias minister of defense georgia is a multi ethnic republic and the whole point of the ossetian ethnic question is this south ossetia is part of georgia
8027196 everyone regardless of nationality even those who love georgia genuinely thought saakashvili started it
8027197 absolutely weve been trying to tell the world about this for months if you go back and look at the archives youll see plenty of calls from the georgian government saying theyre really worried even some russian commentators agree that this is exactly what happened dont forget they sent in a lot of irregulars chechens cossacks ossetians ingush basically thugs not normal chechens or ingush thugs thugs out for a holiday many western camera crews were robbed at gunpoint ten meters from russian tanks while russian commanders just stood there smoking their cigarettes while the irregulars that happened to a turkish tv crew theyre lucky to still be alive some of the georgians were picked up by the irregulars if they happened to be female they got raped if they happened to be male they got shot immediately sometimes tortured injured people we have in hospitals who managed to get out have had arms chopped off eyes gouged out and their tongues ripped out
8027198 you also have to remember the propaganda campaign that came out
8027199 human rights watch is accusing the russian authorities of being indirectly responsible for the massive ethnic cleansing of georgians that happened in south ossetia
8027200 that goes on a lot where i usually work in the middle east
8027201 a key tool that the soviet union used to keep its empire together
8027202 was pitting ethnic groups against one another they did this extremely skillfully in the sense that they never generated ethnic wars within their own territory

8027294 it has been fully established that between august 7 and 12 georgias armed forces invaded the territory of the unrecognised republic with the aim of fully annihilating the ossetian ethnic group living in south ossetia

8027341 we have noticed a substantial increase in the spread of dutch elm disease and its quite worrying because about a quarter of our broad leaf trees are elms of some sort
8027342 we have a very significant population of elms on the island
8027343 the disease hasnt been as widespread as it has been in other parts of the british isles so we are very lucky to have retained a percentage of our trees
8027344 it can damage their legacy in the long run if they dont get a grip pretty quick
8027345 they did a lot of damage against him so theyre going to have to do a lot more than the ordinary for him not just for him but for the public to believe them

8027364 the obama campaign knows it cant argue the facts of the link between obama and ayers so it is instead resorting to a desperate campaign of intimidation and legal threats
8027365 the scary question this raises is if barack obama demonstrates this little regard for free speech from his opponents during the campaign what could the american people expect from him as a president
8027366 the tremendous amount of time money and effort the campaign is expending to run its own ads on the ayers controversy and dispatch its hired guns all over the country during the democratic convention speaks to the fear they must have that this issue is resonating with american voters

8027370 i dont have to tell you that public opinion has shifted dramatically
8027371 over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8027372 more honest effort to lay out the authentic position of the church
8027373 im going to assume from her remark that she had a fundamental misunderstanding of the catholic opposition to abortion as a fundamental teaching of the church
8027374 i hope she understands this is not an historical controversy recently settled but a long standing fundamental teaching of the catholic church that abortion is inherently immoral and perhaps it will help open her heart
8027375 scandalous is the word that many catholics use when they feel that a catholic elected official of the highest rank fundamentally is erroneous about what is catholic teaching or not
8027376 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable
8027377 speaker of the house nancy pelosi is a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
8027378 is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it
8027379 her views on when life begins were informed by the views of saint augustine who said the law does not provide that the act abortion pertains to homicide for there cannot yet be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation
8027380 while catholic teaching is clear that life begins at conception many catholics do not ascribe to that view

8027492 but only expectations that cause emotional arousals that are not acted upon during the day become dreams during sleep
8027493 dreaming deactivates that emotional arousal by completing the expectation pattern metaphorically freeing the brain to respond afresh to each new day
8027494 the key to identifying what the dream was about is its emotion
8027495 theories of dreaming that do not allow for occasional lucidity are necessarily incorrect or incomplete because lucid dreaming is an acknowledged phenomenon our view of the rem state and the function of dreaming does not exclude lucidity in dreams
8027496 however lucid dreaming is a fairly volatile and rare phenomenon even for those who have experienced it and so such hopes have not been realised
8027497 lucid dreaming occurs in the rem state like any other phenomenon involving memory metaphor and imagination
8027498 they describe their limbs as pulling or propelling them through the air as though swimming its as if an ancient premammalian template for swimming left over from a time when our far distant ancestors lived in the oceans is still able to be co opted by the brain for a metaphor
8027499 rem sleep occurs during sleep dreaming to dearouse us but can also occur during our waking lives either induced by someone else hypnosis by something else hallucinogens
8027500 the waking state of a subject after taking hallucinogenic compounds is this experience accessing the rem state of mind
8027501 the strange thoughts and awareness of dream like events or weird thought processes are what happens when your brain performs a hemisphere switch from the left to the right in order that you can switch off and go to sleep
8027502 we do a mini hemispherical switch from left brain to right brain so we can process this information from the left brain to the right knowledge is contained in patterns

8027589 and as a consequence to those five people coming forward weve identified another eight people so at this stage were speaking to 13 people
8027590 what we can say at this stage is that there is a number of lines of inquiry that have come from the initial inquiries

8027649 so are you guys for or against the health care plan
8027650 employers with more than 10 workers must provide coverage or face a payroll tax
8027651 well youve got to have a cutoff somewhere and itll be arbitrary no matter what but it makes the marginal cost for adding that 11th worker pretty darn steep could use some tinkering
8027652 about 600 million from payroll taxes and the states settlement with tobacco companies would pay for medicaid expansion and subsidize purchases of private insurance
8027653 the state would seek to enroll those currently eligible for medicaid who have yet to sign up for it but the house also would raise income limits for medicaid eligibility allowing an additional 205 000 people to enroll
8027654 a stripped down private insurance plan would be offered to eligible residents for less than 200 a month the plans may have high deductibles
8027655 argh can you say perverse incentives yes i grudgingly accept that its better for people to be covered for expensive cases but in health care the
8027656 supporters call the house plan the most ambitious of the proposals with new government spending and new requirements on businesses they say it would encourage employers to provide insurance and reward those that already do
8027657 business groups fear that the plan because of the payroll tax would make the state less economically competitive romney could veto a final bill if it contains the tax
8027658 well it would make our workforce healthier and more productive in the long run take some burden off of companies that do offer insurance and yes put a burden on those who dont
8027659 companies that have at least 50 employees and do not provide health insurance would be forced to reimburse the state when employees seek treatment from free care pool
8027660 the senate would not require individuals to carry health insurance
8027661 the senate plan would push to enroll 70 000 residents eligible for masshealth who havent signed up
8027662 the plan would also increase medicaid rates to hospitals and doctors who treat them
8027663 obviously important to hospitals im not well versed on this end
8027664 it encourages insurers to offer low cost scaled back health plans to the self employed small businesses and individuals who dont qualify for medicaid but cannot afford traditional insurance it would be up to insurance companies to develop the plans
8027665 the senate plan doesnt aim to cover everyone immediately so it is considered more realistic and less heavy handed it has fewer requirements for employers and doesnt require individuals to buy insurance
8027666 critics worry that the senate bill doesnt fully solve the problem of the uninsured

8027676 hes got to tell the australian people why he wants to raise a raft of new inflationary taxes when the government already has a huge surplus when inflation is elevated and every one of these taxes will put upward pressure on inflation
8027677 the objective of good government is for government to raise no more money than it needs
8027678 i think its important from time to time that the prime minister take the opportunity at venues like the press club to outline and update our plans for the future

8027757 obama may not want to be counted as a muslim but muslims are eager to count him as one of their own
8027758 he has to be good for arabs because he is a muslim
8027759 he cant be a christian his middle name is hussein
8027760 the symbolism of a major american presidential candidate with the middle name of hussein who went to elementary school in indonesia
8027761 dont really understand obamas family tree but what they do know is that if america despite being attacked by muslim militants on 9 11 were to elect as its president some guy with the middle name hussein it would mark a sea change in america muslim world relations

8027767 weve got beers from 40 or 50 different breweries across the united states
8027768 the goal is to showcase the diversity of beer styles within american craft beer and also to show the community the camaraderie surrounding craft beer
8027769 a lot of people are bringing some very special beers
8027770 one of the beers we brewed this year was a wheat wine
8027771 it was just 3 8 percent alcohol by volume and its been my beer of choice all summer

8027776 thats probably why we wanted to do those covers for free just instant gratification throw them out there and let people download them right away our album came out two months ago and now we have another album of covers for free for people i like bands that do that
8027777 i think were sort of blessed in that we are all pretty good friends
8027778 there are a lot of bands that are bandmates before theyre friends and thats kind of weird to us
8027779 by the time we were done with the album all i wanted to do was get on the road and play our songs but now im really itching to get back into the studio
8027780 why i write songs in the first place is to get in the studio and start working i really like to use the studio to its full potential as another instrument or whatever then playing live is a completely different experience thats really great as well
8027781 ive been messing around with a bunch of different things just trying to expand our palette

8027798 very thoughtful very careful very respectful of supreme court precedent he has a strong conservative intellectual approach to things but he is respectful honest and straightforward
8027799 he cares a lot about the words of the statute or constitutional provision or contract
8027800 not interested in being expansive with judicial opinions he decides the specific issue in front of him and is not inclined to go beyond that
8027801 interested in focusing on the immediate case at hand he is not someone who is eager to reach out and grab broad principles and institute them separate and apart from the case
8027802 id rather have someone who has real intellectual ability who has experience who has a history of making these kinds of difficult decisions and who has demonstrated respect for the court as an institution than a stealth candidate

8027817 client virtualisation will be very big but tech populism will be even bigger
8027818 theres a mind shift happening in it and were starting to see that change theyre loosening up their policies on whats acceptable
8027819 in the end they want their employees to be as productive as humanly possible so theyll approve tools that people are more comfortable with the tools they may be running at home
8027820 theyre saying if we can find some way to manage and support these we will
8027821 its all just less about what end users clients are running
8027822 certainly some businesses and also some us government agencies will explore diversifying their portfolios
8027823 weve talked to some who have explicit goals to have macs account for 10 of their client base for example but i think apple will continue a slow but steady increase not accelerate
8027824 when two teams usually make it to the ncaa tournament its indicative of how competitive the conference is as always we have our sights set on trying to win a conference title it will be a challenge as any of the top six teams in the socon could win the crown

8027854 i wonder what it is about greer that makes people whove never met her or even read any of her books feel perfectly comfortable about making personal judgements of her personality appearance and manner while completely ignoring her arguments
8027855 do you think that feminism was the most successful revolution of the 20th century
8027856 what it is about greer that makes people whove never met her or even read any of her books feel perfectly comfortable about making personal judgements of her personality appearance and manner while completely ignoring her arguments
8027857 clearly theres an over writing of her image with all sorts of gendered stereotypes

8027864 klaus thanks for that i havent read either whitefella jump up or any responses though
8027865 i think a lot of the tossers who diss greer just want to make their own little minds seem bigger than they are ultimate tall poppy syndrome
8027866 the alternatives are inevitably ghettoized cultures permanent strife and eventually civil wars
8027867 so far there is no evidence that the postworld war ii intake of nonanglomorph immigrants generates opposition to our hegemonially anglomorph culture and political system
8027868 occasionally such ethnic diversions can be exploited to subvert our general system
8027869 there can be no reason for deanglifying a country such as this
8027870 anglomorphy as a dominant way of life is good enough where a country is marked or crowned by it
8027871 the aboriginal establishment is going to pour oil over me for sexualising the problem
8027872 i think youre reinforcing my perception of the gendered aspect of the reaction to greer
8027873 while i appreciate that a lot of people were opposed to the nt emergency response either as a package or in part i would urge you to read what women and some men in the communities are saying about how it has changed their lives
8027874 are there a lot of fairy tales for troglodytes written with wit and verve
8027875 the battle for australia incorporates all those battles that were fought by australians in the pacific war and in a period during which the australian mainland itself was in danger of being invaded by the japanese
8027876 what it is about greer that causes people to get het up
8027877 express ing comprehensive opinions on this book without reading it

8027879 welfare mentalities dysfunctional behaviour and all sorts of culturally justified explanations about and for our benefit to understand ourselves apparerently

8027935 some perspective on the policy arguments between the mccain and obama camps
8027936 want the federal government making decisions for consumers or for providers
8027937 like other democrats he was pushing for a big government program to deal with what he saw as market failures in health care and to bring down the price of insurance
8027938 program was in place though he trusted a market of individuals to make its own decisions once the government had subsidized health insurance he thought the vast majority of the uninsured would sign up
8027939 find traction in the presidential race where health care remains a large issue
8027940 give both candidates a spring board to tout their very different health care plans
8027941 move some money from here to there cut some government waste no one apparently ever noticed and then fund an unattainable promise with an outlandish price tag
8027942 totes up dubious savings to fund his ultimate goal of making health insurance affordable to everyone
8027943 obamas own web site points out that health insurance premiums have risen six times faster than wages in the last four years
8027944 to be sure there are many laudable goals in obamas plan
8027945 improve the nations health and may moderate if not lower long term health care costs
8027946 near term price tag is clearly being underestimated to make the medicine go down a little easier
8027947 promises to provide every american access to affordable comprehensive health care and to achieve long overdue mental health and addiction treatment parity
8027948 thats right the dems will expand the number of people who receive subsidized health care provide better benefits and you apparently dont have to worry about costs going up
8027949 dems are going to eliminate waste in the medical system they will save the typical family up to 2 500 per year
8027950 how to pay for all these bright packages chances are that you wont have to give but only will get get get
8027951 then the platform promises a return to fiscal responsibility really

8027965 such a program will cater for the very basic needs in form of information and education for seafarers when it comes to hiv aids
8027966 these people are very vulnerable as most information does not reach them due to their extended length of stay at sea

8027972 risks significant misuse of funds in this 39 billion program
8027973 has seriously degraded cms ability to meet its responsibilities in combating fraud and abuse
8027974 some plan sponsors are dragging their feet on required anti fraud prevention and cms is letting them get away with it
8027975 orally instructed auditors to deviate from written policies by making determinations based primarily on the limited medical records available from equipment suppliers
8027976 i want to know what happened whos responsible who will be held accountable and what hhs secretary mike leavitt will do about it
8027977 if people cooked the books manipulated the methodology or told the contractor to ignore the rules those individuals need to take the heat
8027978 if this is true this is an outrageous and unforgivable stunt cracking down on fraud should be a top priority for medicare not fixing numbers to make an agency look better
8027979 i expect hearings and i expect answers truthful answers from medicare about this report
8027980 an unsupported extrapolation at this time because the report only cited percentages
8027981 we have far exceeded our expectations having reduced the error rate beyond the 2006 goal of 5
8027982 exceeded only by a staggering lack of oversight by congress and by medicares own failure to protect the program against open thievery
8027983 cooking the books proves true heads should roll at cms
8027984 adequately fund investigations and after medical industry lobbyists complained about a new law requiring competitive bidding congress reneged on the deal
8027985 politicos lingering around washington can barely keep a straight face as they claim to be shocked
8027986 his ilk consistently claim that medicare is a model for government run universal health care because it spends less on overhead than the private sector
8027987 insurance companies spend money to screen their claims for fraud
8027988 medicare automatically pays more than 95 of the bills it receives
8027989 this lack of scrutiny reduces overhead but it makes the program highly vulnerable to abuse
8027990 the real reason liberals like mr stark are outraged is because they want to claim one of medicares vices as a virtue to help along their health care ambitions
8027991 shows that taxpayers will be literally poorer if stark gets his way

8028228 the governor believes californians ought have the opportunity to vote on these four measures on the november ballot despite the fact that the legislature is two months past their deadline in passing a budget
8028229 the governor remains committed that he is not going to sign any bills until we have a budget
8028230 however these four measures need to get on the november ballot and he does not believe simply because the legislature has failed to do their job that californians should not have the opportunity to vote on these measures
8028231 it is unfortunate that republicans continue to block progress on a budget budget reform the lottery and a water bond without any proposals of their own
8028232 it s time for the governor to stop sending letters and holding press conferences and start getting votes from legislators of his own party so that our state can move forward on these critical issues
8028233 thats like saying you wish more kids would die in iraq because it will make the war look bad

8028244 have you ever had to define yourself in the midst of criticism and did you succeed
8028245 my first job after business school was to lead a product development team at abc corporation one of my responsibilities involved participating in weekly product planning meetings that decided on product features after the meeting i would meet with my staff and delegate the programming tasks since i am an experienced programmer i would explain details of how each feature needed to be programmed i expected my staff to write the programs in c test and debug we seemed to work very well as a team
8028246 three months later my manager had collected feedback from my staff in my performance review my manager observed that i could improve my delegation skills i was surprised to receive this feedback i had believed that i was good at delegating given that i would detail my expectations of each staff member and list every step he she needed to work on it believed my staff was productive and continually gained knowledge from my coaching i thanked my manager for the feedback and promised to reflect on my delegating style and consider a change
8028247 i reflected on my delegation approach and realized two problems
8028248 my staff was very excited about the opportunity to propose ideas brainstorm and choose a preferred way of going about their work it was no longer my idea they would work on it was their own idea and their own approach they were more enthusiastic about their work and realized they were an integral part of something bigger than themselves during the next quarterly meeting my manager praised me for empowering my team

8028250 the choir is an ambassador for the mission of the project
8028251 the mission was to educate people about the way in which coming together to sing the songs that enslaved africans created has the potential not only for personal healing but also for racial reconciliation
8028252 people feel that just because theyre coming together in an interracial setting we have to raise awareness that were bringing all of our racial baggage into that situation even when were singing

8028262 these eruptions occurred around 260 million years ago and heralded in a new period in earths history of supercontinent break up and mass extinctions
8028263 to give you an idea of the scale of these eruptions the eruption of mount st helens in america in 1980 released just over one cubic kilometre of magma
8028264 eruptions in the emeishan province probably evacuated anywhere between 100 and 5 000 cubic kilometres of magma
8028265 and it was not just one eruption but tens to hundreds all occurring within a million years or so each one just huge
8028266 this igneous event in china has been argued to have been the trigger for climate change and an important mass extinction event in earths history approximately 260 million years ago
8028267 this area has previously been believed to be the best example of mantle plume triggered volcanic activity where rapid surface uplift over a kilometre high occurred in response to the mantle plume rising up from more than 2000 km deep within the earth
8028268 what we found was the first massive eruptions resulted from basaltic magma reacting fiercely and explosively with the shallow marine sea that had previously existed in southwestern china for millions of years
8028269 this explosive style of volcanism may have also provided a more efficient mechanism for volcanic gases to reach the stratosphere and drift around the world to cause climate change and the mass extinction event at 260 million years ago

8028278 a recent norwegian study showed while companies generally consider supply chain management to be strategically important a lack of competence and poor understanding of logistics costs often prevented these companies from maximising the value of supply chain relationships
8028279 the study also found most of companies surveyed did not intend to take action to build competence in the supply chain
8028280 it is also related to the lack of professional status associated with supply chain management
8028281 effective supply chain relationships are dependent on the competence levels of the participants to recognise and evolve the benefits
8028282 supply chain management is no longer just a support function it can be the spearhead of competitive advantage and a strategic weapon in the marketplace
8028283 the results keep demonstrating that changing to circular hooks is the right choice since it favours turtle conservation without having an impact on the economy of artisanal fisheries
8028284 together with fishermen we are building a culture for sustainable fishing practices that will guarantee fish stocks in the long term
8028285 our goal is to reduce the incidental catch of marine turtles from the long line fishing operations without affecting the fisheries activity which is a main source of food and income for local communities
8028286 this programme is going beyond an initial focus of saving sea turtles from bycatch and is creating the groundwork toward sustainable artisanal long line fishing in the eastern pacific
8028287 by working co operatively collecting data and learning how to improve practices this programme is living proof that conservation and industry can work together for sustainability

8028292 were heading to stop seven cause were going to the midway were going to walk all the way through the midway and were going to go on all the rides were going to get on the tram on the other end and come all the way around the fair and watch the shows
8028293 we dont know yet really were casing the joint and well pick out a spot to get off
8028294 were going around the backside looking for a specific tent back there we dont even know the name of yet so we get to ride around to see outside
8028295 it is a very busy time and mostly my interest is where theyre going what they do at these but also who is going to be involved for running whos going to be our leaders

8028300 as a gas hydrogen sulfide has a number of advantages
8028301 it diffuses across cell membranes it can be delivered quickly and it protects cells via several basic biochemical pathways
8028302 the eastern portion of the fault has moved at a predictable rate and the earthquake activity associated with it has been what we would expect
8028303 but the western part of the fault has been lagging in terms of the number and size of earthquakes it seems to be straining absorbing the motion
8028304 it could mean that the fault is getting ready for a large earthquake or it could mean that the movement has been so gradual that we couldnt detect it
8028305 land stations also detected a four fold increase in the number of earthquakes along the blanco fault in 2008 compared to background rates
8028306 our monitoring may be missing a lot of earthquakes that are less than 3 0
8028307 the western side of the fault may be experiencing a series of mini quakes that we cant detect or it could be slowing creeping along in a way we cannot measure
8028308 but we cant discount the possibility that its energy hasnt been released and it will some day in the form of a good sized earthquake
8028309 you need quite a bit of vertical displacement on the ocean floor to generate a tsunami
8028310 between the land based network the hydrophones and other instruments the threshold of detection for earthquakes has definitely lowered over the past 20 years
8028311 but we still cant tell whether the western part of the fault has thousands or even millions of infinitesimal slips or it is building up to a major earthquake
8028312 the size reduction in the hippocampus seems to occur sometime after the initial exposure to stress or trauma in childhood strengthening the argument that it has something to do with ptsd itself or the stress exposure
8028313 most people exposed to traumatic events do not develop ptsd
8028314 however those that do may show certain changes in their brains
8028315 the big question about which came first much like the chicken and the egg has persisted
8028316 we found childrens hippocampi were intact after the onset of abuse but somehow there was shrinkage in the group that had reached adulthood
8028317 with what we have found the effects of childhood abuse may have neurological ramifications well into adult life boiling it down people should be nice to their children
8028318 we report that oral inoculation with a y pseudotuberculosis strain selected for its very low virulence induces an efficient immunity against bubonic plague without causing adverse reactions
8028319 this demonstrates that a live attenuated y pseudotuberculosis can be a promising vaccine against bubonic plague
8028320 the implication is that people at risk of macular degeneration could help prevent the disease by consuming antioxidants
8028321 this work by dr vollmer snarr and colleagues ties these two damaging processes together and demonstrates the harm they cause in combination is much more than would be expected
8028322 this new knowledge suggests the possibility of interventions which could prove to be powerful ways to prevent or delay age related macular degeneration

8028330 its closer to home and more of my friends come here so its kind of easier to adjust to the college atmosphere
8028331 we are probably one of the first or highest in all the suny comprehensive that are closer to the governors suny mandate that by 2010 we are going to reduce our energy
8028332 making sure the appliances the microwave and so on are energy star rated so that we are getting limiting the power consumption to the extent we can we wanted to make sure the use of water was limited not by affecting the water pressure so that it would be used most efficiently
8028333 its not just a place to live its also hopefully a learning experience for them so they can take what theyve gained from learning about sustainability here carry it through the rest of their lives

8028335 john quinlan a reporter for the sioux city journal said his notes showed biden said he was quoting kinnock when he used the same passage in a speech aug 14
8028336 he paid great attention to me and the way i like to sound he understood what i was putting across claus is never an obtrusive always a firm support encouraging an artist to give their best
8028337 ive received some criticism for using background vocalists on earlier albums but thats not why i chose to omit them this time it was purely a musical decision after all if youre working with a genius like claus ogerman why bother with adding singers besides i believe that anyone who dug pieces of dreams will also enjoy my last couple of albums theyre different but theyre both me
8028338 but i dont like that concept of paying dues because it implies great suffering to me paying your dues is that period of time when youre learning your craft becoming a professional sure ive had a lot of bad times but then who hasnt a musician probably doesnt suffer any more than a guy on the line in detroit
8028339 ray was a great influence on me he took me under his wing taught me lots and lots of things that im still using today that man truly amazed me because even though he was blind he was absolutely and totally independent

8028344 the stain of racial segregation beclouded american society blacks and whites pursued separate and unequal lives not just in the south but throughout the nation confronted by rigid barriers created by the color line african americans forged their own institutions and culture creating a world invisible to most whites but nonetheless vibrant innovative and distinctive baseball offered one of the most dynamic examples of this phenomenon

8028351 i cant wait for the season to start ive never been to a dolphins game its going to be insane and such an adrenaline rush but im most looking forward to just being out there in our uniforms my flexibility is improving because we stretch so much i do my kicks and stretches every day and i do my splits all the time getting used to our boots is the hardest part theyre like four inch platforms
8028352 this article introduces the participatory action research paradigm which is based upon the goal of helping people and employs methodologies that are different from traditional consumer research

8028354 for those of us who are fortunate enough to possess these considerable resources it is time to move away from the comfort of the sidelines step onto the field and charge into the important work of solving our pressing social problems

8028356 i quotidiani nei giorni scorsi hanno riportato la notizia di numerosi cittadini che si sono visti recapitare direttamente a domicilio verbali della polizia municipale con la contravvenzione di 160 per aver violato uno dei divieti imposti dal regolamento di polizia municipale come per esempio aver steso i panni ad asciugare sul lato prospicente la via pubblica o per aver collocato la bici in sosta fuori dalle rastrelliere che peraltro non cerano dichiarano luca ragazzo capogruppo dei verdi in provincia e tommaso grassi portavoce provinciale e capogruppo al quartiere 5 in questi giorni di vacanze gli agenti di polizia municipale con tanta solerzia hanno applicato le sanzioni previste dal nuovo regolamento che peraltro la gran parte dei cittadini neppure conosce ed davvero singolare scoprire che in realt il nuovo regolamento esecutivo solo da ieri
8028357 dall11 agosto il comune di firenze sta applicando il nuovo regolamento di polizia municipale ribattezzato sotto leufemistica dizione di
8028358 le deliberazioni diventano esecutive dopo il decimo giorno dalla loro pubblicazione
8028359 tutte le deliberazioni del comune sono pubblicate mediante affissione per quindici giorni consecutivi rilevano i due verdi il ministero dellinterno ha emesso parere interpretativo il 22 marzo e il 13 settembre 2006 rispondendo a specifici quesiti sulla
8028360 il periodo di dieci giorni necessari per lesecutivit delle deliberazioni stesse andr a decorrere dal giorno 16 successivo al completamento del periodo di pubblicazione
8028361 nel caso del regolamento di firenze non essendo stata votata in consiglio comunale la immediata esecutivit i 10 giorni quindi non possono che decorrere dal 16 giorno come confermato anche dal parere espresso dal coordinatore del dipartimento giuridico dei verdi dott
8028362 chiediamo quindi che il comune annulli le multe comminate dall11 agosto al 25 agosto per violazione dei divieti introdotti dal nuovo regolamento di polizia municipale per evitare che siano avviati numerosi ricorsi con dispendio economico e di tempo sia per i cittadini che per lamministrazione sostengono ragazzo e grassi riguardo ai primi esempi di applicazione pratica del regolamento riteniamo che essi abbiano messo in evidenza la mancanza di equilibrio tra la necessit di innalzare il livello di coscienza civile e la giustizia e lequit degli interventi sanzionatori punendo categorie deboli come coloro che abitano in appartamenti troppo piccoli per stendere i panni allinterno e coloro che usano mezzi di trasporto ecologici come la bici che invece di essere incentivati e premiati vengono puniti con il sequestro del mezzo e la sanzione di 160
8028363 lassessore cioni e il comandante bartolini devono ammettere che il regolamento impone nuovi divieti e nuove norme difficilmente digeribili e assimilabili in poco tempo dai cittadini soprattutto in completa assenza di comunicazione da parte dellamministrazione e affida poteri totalmente discrezionali alla polizia municipale che in questi giorni hanno prodotto un inutile e folle persecuzione degli abitanti di firenze concludono chi fosse stato multato potr ricorrere per richiedere lannullamento della sanzione inflitta dagli agenti in missione punitiva portando i pareri del ministero che forniremo a chiunque ce li richieda a propria difesa

8028365 the research found this noninvasive method of cardiac imaging will effectively detect stenosis a constriction or narrowing of the coronary arteries which can lead to heart attacks and may require surgery to repair
8028366 this is good news for patients who in the past might have been forced to undergo a more expensive and invasive procedure to determine if they suffered from blockages in the arteries leading to their hearts
8028367 to have that kind of data is hugely valuable and the list of applications is endless and spans all of biology
8028368 but it all hinges on building an accurate database our study is a cautionary tale if were going to do it lets do it right
8028369 i recognize that some who do dna barcoding may be upset by this study but that is the nature of science
8028370 building a genetic library of all life is a great goal but we need to be careful to pay attention to the data that go into that library to make sure they are accurate
8028371 before they only kidnapped key well known economically successful people like industrialists and landowners now they are kidnapping people from the middle class
8028372 you cannot negotiate anything about final status if you dont talk about jerusalem final status consists primarily i believe of jerusalem and refugees if you want to postpone jerusalem you postpone refugees really you are not dealing with the problem you have to discuss these issues and that is exactly where the trade off has to be made
8028373 i still favor a two state solution and will continue to do so but
8028374 but on the other hand if we are looking at what is happening on the ground in israel and the occupied territories you see things happening in the opposite direction as if they are not connected to reality thought is running in one direction reality in the other
8028375 we can fight for equal rights rights of existence return and equality and we could take it slowly over the years and there could be a peaceful movement like in south africa
8028376 i think one should maybe begin on the palestinian side to begin a debate to reengage in the idea of one state
8028377 it so happens that fatah in particular the mainstream party and
8028378 these are isolated incidents but they do reflect a major sickness
8028379 what is the driving force behind a two state solution the fact that it seems more acceptable to a majority of people on both sides and therefore more applicable the primary motivation is to minimize human suffering this is what we should all be looking at if there will be a one state solution it will not come today or tomorrow its a long protracted thing not the ideal solution unless in an ideal world people really want to be together then it is the ideal solution the best solution the one that causes the least pain and that can actually be instrumental to a one state solution is to have peace now and acceptance of one another on the basis of two states
8028380 thats an ultimatum unless a major breakthrough happens by the end
8028381 fifty 100 200 years down the road there will be some kind of conclusion sometime in the future however far away this future is i believe well be living at peace with one another in some way or another i am not sure how whether in one state or two states or in a confederation of states but people finally will come to live at peace in the meantime we will simply cause pain to one another its tragic it is very tragic because we know we can do it now that today it is possible with some guts leadership vision we can make it happen today we can reach a peaceful solution today the arab peace initiative proposed in 2002 is a fantastic chance the palestinians have adopted it theyll go with it all the way it is a perfect chance it doesnt even mention right of return it is even better than the ayalon nusseibeh plan but i am willing to accept it
8028382 because for israel however important jerusalem may be the primary
8028383 the facts on the ground are making the situation irreversible
8028384 take the clinton parameters palestinian neighborhoods are palestinian sovereignty jewish neighborhoods are jewish sovereignty they are acceptable in principle but with realities on the ground like the expulsion of arab families from their homes in the sheikh jarrah neighborhood and the inhabitation of those areas by jewish settlers its going to be unacceptable on a practical level thats why we dont have time
8028385 ramallahs reaction was a bit worried they called me a few times a bit worried
8028386 we have a terrible situation our political bible our platform our moral values we need to be brought together again if not for creating a state then for our own sanity and for own values as a people apart from in ramallah everybody is living under very bad conditions the occupation is terrible the siege is everywhere pressure as it is the europeans are financing the occupation and the europeans are happy because they feel theyre doing something it cleans their conscience and the israelis are happy because theyre not paying for it and the palestinians are happy because they are getting their wages paid it keeps the economy going and people are getting complacent about it its dead money going after dead money
8028387 i said i want to tell you what you can do to transform yourself from a payer into a player make your money payments conditional on tangible progress in the peace process
8028388 i was in brussels i gave a talk and i said to the europeans if you want to pass on money do it only on the condition we build a state in which case it makes sense for you to spend money to build us an international airport but if in the end there isnt going to be an independent palestinian state why waste your money waste your money if you need to on integrating us into israeli society makes more sense pay the money for us to become part of israel to have equal rights raise our level of education bring our standards of living up but to have the pa taking all this money creating all this debt makes no sense maybe the europeans should link the aid they are giving us to real progress in peace talks so that both the israelis and the palestinians will be shocked out of their complacency or lack of commitment
8028389 the pa has no use if we fail to reach a peace agreement by the end of this year i believe it would be best to go back to the period when we were living happily under occupation we had a small civil administration they were paying back some 20 million a year to the israeli treasury so they were making money off us today we are creating year after year bigger deficits we are spending billions we have 160 000 employees half of them are security personnel who give us no security whatsoever we are spending masses of money on guns which we only use against each other and which provide us no security the whole thing is a mess
8028390 people in jerusalem why should they attach themselves to the
8028391 i respect ami ayalon he is a very honest person that is something
8028392 i was still hoping because before he went to the labor party he came and spoke to me i like this about him i knew what he was doing people were pushing him for a long time trying to get him into the system and he resisted but then at one stage i think he made up his mind maybe i can lead the labor party and then this is the best place for me to be i said fine do it i was unhappy that he became marginalized as minister without portfolio
8028393 i believe that on israeli side olmert could do the same we dont know whether both leaders will be reelected but its worth doing even if theyre not because at least we know weve given this peace agreement a chance
8028394 i share his view that olmert missed a chance to get an agreement due to efforts to insure his own political survival the labor party will not succeed in getting back in power by attacking the other parties but only by raising the common banner of security and political agreements
8028395 in 2007 john mccain voted with the administration 95 percent of the time so if he is the answer the question must be ridiculous there is only one candidate who will make the change that we need to restore the promise of america he is a man of integrity he is a man of honesty he loves his country he is barack obama
8028396 its boring i dont like to be in that class i thought it was going to be fun
8028397 interestingly enough their new ceo seems to be learning from their past mistakes hes been hands off on mythic as war has been built anyone who thinks otherwise hasnt been a beta tester like me and doesnt know enough to argue
8028398 this is a high capacity classic family ride with a modern twist
8028399 when parents cant find their small child even for a few minutes its enough to ruin their day
8028400 its like dangling a carrot in front of a rabbit youre gonna send them to an amusement park but they cant be amused
8028401 its a 12 hour drive for a 15 minute parade and then a 12 hour drive back
8028402 it would have been fun and i would have really liked to have gone with my group of friends but it didnt kill me inside or anything
8028403 as a parent who just sent her child to college five hours away i can tell you i was glad my daughter had this experience while still having the guidance of caring adults nearby
8028404 its purely a byproduct of gameplay and this notion of a highly destructible environment
8028405 sticking to our ethos of do no harm to the game we tagged the parts in the environment for ads and like everything else in the game they can be destroyed its mirroring what the studio wants out of gameplay and making the most of it if we did anything that wasnt destructible in mercenaries 2 itd be awkward its taking advantage of the full environment
8028406 i had called after reading that one of his top consultants dan payne had

8028409 amusement companies have all stepped up to the plate doing the right thing and the ones didnt want to do the right thing stopped working in massachusetts
8028410 they do a thorough inspection looking for obvious signs of wear and tear not necessarily structural cracks that cant be seen with the naked eye but looking into areas of high stress for potential damage and stress damage they go through seatbelts restraining devices and check the emergency stops
8028411 you have the term carnies and you think of the austin powers movie where nuclear weapons and carnies are the two things hes afraid of
8028412 thats a false perception of what they are and its unfortunate because there are a lot of very good professionals out there we take amusement safety very seriously in massaschusetts
8028413 this is hydraulic and computer driven equipment now and even amusement ride operators have to be well trained
8028414 st judes ranch for children a non profit home for abused and neglected children reuses cards by cutting off the front cover and then are glued onto new cards
8028415 id rather resolve this issue without getting marvels legal department involved because we are a very small start up and lack a legal department

8028418 vigorous expression of the freedoms that make our society great
8028419 and each generation needs to explore the history of the past to understand fully the context in which these polar extremes come into clashes with one another so history of how we dealt with these problems in the 1940s and 1950s is a current history and a history that is very important for us to understand
8028420 i am very happy very proud i have done a country of four million people done my family proud my parents
8028421 it was a fantastic games and that welcome home was just overwhelming
8028422 that was the most fabulous welcome back i have ever been involved with
8028423 i probably had a personal target a bit higher than that
8028424 we have a strong sense of respect around the team and we think they did something that wasnt respectful to another team mate
8028425 once the team management and the swimmers and nzoc get back in the country well meet with them and review everything and decide at that stage whether any further action is necessary
8028426 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
8028427 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
8028428 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
8028429 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner
8028430 he is a very skilled player a very hard thrower
8028431 there are a lot of beginners this is not a high powered league this is a developmental league whose main purpose is to promote the sport
8028432 i have never seen behavior of a parent like the behavior jerichos mother exhibited wednesday night
8028433 you dont have to be learned in the law to know in your heart that its wrong
8028434 now you have to be punished because you excel at something
8028435 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8028436 in my view if don bradman was playing today he would still have an average as twice as good as any other batsman in the world
8028437 with the advances in bat technology and training imagine how good the don would be today it would be scary he is by far and away the best batsman ever and would still be today
8028438 his name and what he achieved its so far out of any players reach
8028439 the results of this study represent a potentially new therapeutic approach that of control of a biochemical cause of hypertension rather than nonspecifically lowering elevated blood pressure although not representing a fully developed strategy this study raises an alternative strategy that may prove to be more effective than currently available options
8028440 being part of a bowling unit it does not really matter who takes the wickets we have also got the knowledge and experience of andrew flintoff and steve harmison and they are always passing it on
8028441 we are all bowling for each other and the fielding has been fantastic which only gives the bowlers confidence hopefully we can seal the series on friday
8028442 we can only apologise for a very poor performance people were rightly angry that they did not get a proper game
8028443 it is difficult to put a finger on what went wrong we have a number of injuries but that is no excuse we were just not good enough on the field
8028444 we have got to pick ourselves up and make sure our next performance is a lot better
8028445 jeremy my brain cannot function without food i am sorry i am weak

8028452 at the moment rugby is my saviour i let that do the talking thats how i express my expressions
8028453 if im representing the all blacks im an all black 24 7 so ive got to realise that i cant be out at the wee small hours of the morning and doing what i was doing and thats probably come to my senses now
8028454 if i get those things corrected ill be a better man for it
8028455 its only been two months and i think this is the easy part its going to be later down the track when its six to nine months when things will get tough
8028456 you know its easy for me to sit here now and say im clean and i havent done this and i havent done that but its not that easy i am happy with where im at at the moment though
8028457 as i said im very fortunate rugbys probably been my saviour because i was pretty close to losing it at one stage
8028458 i never regarded fedor bondarchuk as the son of sergei bondarchuk that is to say i didnt think about it and didnt sense any continuity
8028459 i didnt make a film about the afghan war i was making a film about the friendship comradeship and love of boys whose state i remember from being 18 in the army in 1985

8028463 species invasions and extinction the future of native biodiversity on islands
8028464 the presumption at the time was that we are driving biodiversity to lower levels
8028465 certainly if you think about it at the global level this is true because humans have done a lot of things that have driven species extinct
8028466 what dov and i worked on a few years ago is the fact that the vast majority of introductions of species dont have large negative effects
8028467 indeed most species that get introduced dont have much effect at all it doesnt mean that theyre not altering the ecosystem but theyre not driving things extinct like some of the big poster child stories weve been hearing about
8028468 the dramatic increase in the number of species has changed how the system functions
8028469 changing the abundance of natives versus exotics affects all of the other species that used to depend on the natives for food or shelter so its not in any way to say that increasing biodiversity is a good thing
8028470 that by going in and mucking up the system we may have already created the setting where too many species have been packed in and we just havent waited long enough to see these extinctions start to happen
8028471 the whole point of this study was to start looking down the path to see which of these wildly different scenarios might be right
8028472 we havent nailed the answer yet but weve set the stage for answering whether islands are now saturated or not
8028473 it was very surprising to find such a strong correlation between the number of native and exotic plant species on islands around the world
8028474 in ecological research a strong correlation often explains 50 percent of the variation here the correlation between native and exotics explains almost 100 percent of the variation in other words if you know how many native plants are on an oceanic island then you can predict almost perfectly how many exotic plants are there
8028475 which means islands that are far enough away from a continent that theyre not getting regular exchanges with the mainland
8028476 detta skulle binda till mpningen p ett olyckligt s tt och riskera att g ra den fyrkantig
8028477 previous studies have shown that it does reduce infections there is some evidence that it may reduce medication errors the physician can talk to the patient in private and the family can be there
8028478 most of the cases of the sars outbreak in toronto came out of a hospital which could have been avoided if they didnt have multiple patients in a room
8028479 i ran bradman out i thought the whole world had collapsed
8028480 i hit it and ran i called and ran the fielder picked it up clean as a whistle and threw the wickets down at the strikers end i still reckon there was a run in it i made it easily
8028481 it was not long after the depression years and people didnt have a shilling so they came out to see bradman
8028482 i made about 50 i didnt want to come in i thought they would throw stones at me it was a big crowd
8028483 bradman wasnt too rapt in him because he was about 16stone and as fat as a whale bradman said hell never make it too fat too slow liked a beer too much but young burgess he shows some potential he was the one that pushed me through he gave me a game
8028484 i dont think he hit a six he hardly ever hit one in the air
8028485 i only made about 19 or 20 and runs were easy
8028486 waite bowled outside of the leg stump just to stop his scoring
8028487 merv said to him what do you think im going to bloody bowl to you ill get carted around like the rest of the bowlers
8028488 at the moment i dont think its diminished its increased
8028489 just look at all these functions that are being put on apart from anything else
8028490 the first was somewhat difficult to come to grips with but bradman regularly delivered you glorious evidence of his omnipotence
8028491 it is one thing to laud the scale of his run scoring it is another to contemplate that its like will never be seen again
8028492 yet nobody has come close to emulating bradman by any yardstick of batsmen to have played 20 test innings none averages above 70 only four above 60 it is irksome that bradman will always stand alone of course because as bolt showed so marvellously we want to improve on those who came before without at all deriding their achievements that is the fun but all studies of bradman and they are by now countless point to his uniqueness
8028493 at least the 100th one doesnt come around too often im feeling pretty good at the moment but i dont think i will worry about the next one
8028494 it continues to surprise me and always will essentially because im my fathers son and it always surprised him
8028495 i remember him first and foremost as a father of course and i think thats the same for everybody the memory of our parents doesnt diminish
8028496 it continues on through our life and its the same for my kids they remember him as a grandfather and it continues on for them
8028497 i think the most precious thing in retrospect was when he gave up everything and stayed at home to look after me when i got polio i would have been institutionalised if he didnt and the effect of that on the lives of young people was very significant
8028498 that was a pretty remarkable thing for any man to do back then
8028499 there was a real sense of panic it was an epidemic it was such an unknown thing and that is something i remember with an immense appreciation i appreciated it at the time but more as time passes
8028500 don bradman says you have to do this so you can get better
8028501 he was never somebody who was tied to the past he was always able to move with change
8028502 mr peters sought help from me for this purpose in a personal conversation some time after i had first met him in sydney i agreed to help in the belief that this step would also assist the labour party in its relationship with mr peters
8028503 mr peters subsequently met me socially at the karaka yearling sales i believe in early 2006 he thanked me for my assistance

8028513 i agreed to help in the belief that this step would also assist the labour party in its relationship with mr peters i supported the labour party

8028516 youll never know which part of the internet youll need
8028517 we considered that because the ad had not explained the limitations viewers were likely to expect to be able to see all the content on a website normally accessible through a pc rather than just having the ability to reach the website
8028518 we are living in a pc world which is destroying us where you actually cant put the hard word on people when they have digressed and committed bad blunders
8028519 in the evenings we went to the rugby parties with the kids who slept in the back of the car we cant do that any more because we havent got rid of the perpetrators that actually destroy our society
8028520 my friends were my childrens role models and i was my friends childrens role model

8028523 ms pat volunteer coordinator pat kilandra said there would be a lot of down time but they keep me busy theres never a dull moment i love being here with the kids theyre so funny
8028524 they can get jobs but in todays market its tough this also gives them experience its a commitment and they treat it like a job
8028525 i dont have daughters so ive really bonded with these kids i call them my volunteers theyve formed friendships with each other theyre all different ages and backgrounds
8028526 during class the first time they kicked us pinched us they were scared
8028527 its good experience were learning people skills if i wasnt here id just be sleeping or playing video games
8028528 shes had to work twice as hard to compete its been a big struggle for her but shes doing well
8028529 all the things that come normal to everybody even walking talking and all those things are difficult for her the thing for me was dealing with the little things like the other little girls were having sleep overs but she marissa was not its not because they the other girls dont like her its because mom and dad arent sure what to do with her if she comes to their house
8028530 shes delayed in development a little bit but shes catching up
8028531 when you get together in this buddy walk with hundreds of families of downs kids its just really good
8028532 we randomly purchased 193 traditional indian ayurvedic medicine products from the internet about 60 percent were from u s companies and 40 percent from indian companies twenty one percent had significant levels of lead mercury and arsenic
8028533 many traditional indian practitioners believe quite strongly that if rasa shastra is done correctly it is safe
8028534 several indian manufactured rasa shastra medicines could result in lead and or mercury ingestions 100 to 10 000 times greater than acceptable limits
8028535 its not an accident that ahpa members performed better weve called our members attention to the presence of heavy metals in plant materials lead is ubiquitous its in the soil and in the plants i dont think you can get these levels to zero but it is the manufacturers responsibility to know the amount and to limit it
8028536 go back to these girls because they are the opposite to me
8028537 thats not just cancer related to melanoma or other skin cancers
8028538 for prostate cancer the trend was in the direction of increased risk but the association was weaker and not statistically significant
8028539 people who have suboptimal ability to repair dna damage that the sun can cause are far more likely to get nonmelanoma skin cancer we are hypothesizing that that might also be the link to why there is a greater increased cancer risk in general
8028540 it is not unreasonable to suppose that patients with nonmelanoma skin cancers especially if diagnosed when the patient is young puts that person in a higher risk category of systemic cancers
8028541 in addition these patients are followed closely for further skin cancers and therefore may have an increased diagnosis of other cancers because they are plugged into the medical system
8028542 our skin cancer patients should know that they may be at increased for a wide variety of cancers like breast lung and colon and should not ignore early signs and symptoms if they occur
8028543 people who have had skin cancers should make sure they are up to date on all their screening tests
8028544 they should be up to date on their colonoscopies fecal occult blood and mammograms and pap smears
8028545 our work showed that all nine antipsychotic drugs we examined uniformly and more potently block the beta arrestin pathway downstream of the d2 dopamine receptor
8028546 some activated it some blocked the g side totally some blocked it only 50 percent the drugs had different profiles for the g protein pathway
8028547 so with this new information drug manufacturers would want to make sure new compounds for antipsychotic use block the beta arrestin pathway
8028548 we found contrary to current recommendations that actually consumption of these foods did not increase the risk of diverticulitis or diverticular bleeding and didnt appear to increase the risk of developing diverticulosis or its complications
8028549 there are probably going to be a subset of people where perhaps a more restrictive diet does benefit them
8028550 this is a far cry from the traditional view of teenagers being awkward shy and ill informed about sex
8028551 theres no doubt that social network communities have had a dramatic impact on teenage sexuality and their access to information about sex
8028552 on the positive side it means teens are much better informed about sex and almost all research suggests access to good non judgemental information about sex decreases the incidence of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections

8028579 the lack of a dominant console means its too difficult for software makers to give up on a console
8028580 with the ps3 or xbox 360 you dont have a clear winner like the playstation 2 or playstation were
8028581 the reality of exclusives is that they will become far more infrequent the way hardware companies have to offset that is through enhancing the quality of games coming through their own studios that will drive customers to buy their own hardware system

8028650 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8028651 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8028652 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8028653 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8028654 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8028655 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people

8028663 the very fact that dolphins have developed the remarkable specialization rather than merely getting rid of sleep altogether should count as evidence that sleep must serve some essential function and cannot be eliminated
8028664 sleep may be the price you pay so your brain can be plastic the next day
8028665 while there may still be no consensus on why animals need to sleep it would seem that searching for a core function of sleep particularly at the cellular level is still a worthwhile exercise

8028675 it is very exciting to watch under a microscope the way these microglial cells gather around and attach to the plaques just as we believe is taking place in alzheimer brains
8028676 it is widely believed that ad is caused by the accumulation of the beta amyloid protein in senile plaques
8028677 in ad patients microglia are not coping with the plaque build up therefore plaques accumulate faster than the microglia can digest them if we can enhance microglial digestion of these plaques we will have a fighting chance to eliminate ad
8028678 this new approach is a way of screening agents against the real disease rather than mouse models of the disease it is just a first step in finding new ways to treat ad
8028679 the next step is to find a therapeutic drug that will stimulate the microglia to devour the plaques

8028704 almost half of the journalists reported they were not familiar with the concept of health literacy but said that their readers ability to understand health information was very important to consider when writing health stories
8028705 increasing knowledge of health literacy could help journalists clarify medical information to readers
8028706 health journalists play an important role in helping people effectively manage their health
8028707 however we found that many journalists find it difficult to explain health information to their readers while maintaining the informations scientific credibility they have to resist bogging down the story with too much technical science data and dumbing down the story with overly simplistic recommendations
8028708 a large percentage of americans are not health literate which is related to significant health problems including medication errors failing to seek treatment and an inability to understand directions about proper health behavior
8028709 the role of a health journalist includes translating medical information and acting as a liaison responsible for providing quality information we need to actively find ways to improve health coverage and recognize the importance of the medias role in improving the publics quality of life

8028761 all i ever wanted was to get paid to write and edit and now that i do i realize i want even more i need the stories in my head to take over for awhile and drown out the real world not that it isnt a nice real world i live in mind you its just that my fiction fantasies seem so much more interesting at times and so i challenged my brother also afflicted with the writers curse to complete nanowrimo with me although i had already published several books as an editor i suddenly found myself relearning everything as i delved into my science fiction universe a trip to central america last summer inspired me but for months i did little except take notes i found that on the very first day of nanowrimo i wrote with a sort of ambitious fervor ive never experienced before it kept me going and though at times my body quite accustomed to home cooked organic fare rebelled at my sudden diet of coca cola coffee and fast food i felt better at my keyboard than i had in years although quite accustomed to deadlines this was different and somehow i felt better seeing my word count fly past 50 000 than i did after seeing my name in print for the first time dont ask me to explain it i just felt free and my imagination soared and the characters surprised me and the plot kept finding new ways to entangle me and i fell more in love than ever with my friend the written word im still finishing up the final touches on what looks to be a 150 000 word project but i know i never would have gotten this thing off the ground without all of you at nanowrimo especially my local groups whose criticisms ideas and opinions gave me the courage to write surprisingly vulnerable poetic language far removed from the succinct 800 word articles or dusty rambling history epics that had come to dominate my literary life thanks for giving me just what i needed and inspiring me to aspire for even more than i dreamed of

8028772 t he monthly pace of decline is slowing rather dramatically from the hefty 2 1 to 2 6 monthly declines over the november march period which may mark the maximum rate of collapse for the u s real estate market in this cycle

8028774 the deceleration in the pace of declines over the past three months together with the better than expected case shiller reading may give markets hope that the housing market is nearing the bottom

8028908 but because zardari is now a presidential candidate ambassador khalilzad postponed the meeting after consulting with senior state department officials and zardari himself
8028909 why do i have to learn about this from asif after its all set up
8028910 we have maintained a public line that we are not involved in the politics or the details we are merely keeping in touch with the parties can i say that honestly if youre providing advice and help please advise and help me so that i understand whats going on here
8028911 it is not possible to conduct coherent foreign policy if senior officials are freelancing
8028912 i know that zardaris interest in becoming president has been clear for quite some time
8028913 it distresses me that the u s government has not learned yet that having our guy is not a winning strategy in pakistan
8028914 whoever our guy is isnt going to be the only guy in town and if we go into it with that view well bump up against a lot of other guys in pakistan
8028915 mr khalilzad being a political animal understood the value of reaching out to pakistans political leadership long before the bureaucrats at the state department realized this would be useful at a future date
8028916 did not make policy or change policy he just became an alternate channel
8028917 our very clear policy is that the pakistanis have to work out any domestic political questions for themselves
8028918 the pakistani elections are an internal matter for the pakistani people

8028963 all objects are believed to have some degree of life force plants have more than rocks and man is near the top of the hierarchy he is surpassed by only the unseen beings of the spirit world of which there are various kinds
8028964 history will record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the vitriolic words and violent actions of the bad people but the appalling silence and indifference of the good people our generation will have to repent not only for the words and acts of the children of darkness but also for the fear and apathy of the children of light

8029050 about 30 per cent of stock purchased at carlisle goes into scotland while the same amount of stock is brought down for sale from scotland we can envisage it being a devastating situation
8029051 we fully support the efforts being taken to ensure the vaccination programme is a success but in order to maintain this success it is clear that the farming community on both sides of the border must buy in to the bluetongue control policy
8029052 without such a buy in it is possible that the vaccine uptake may not reach a level sufficient to deliver a protective shield before the protection zone is extended we think it is important to put the evidence base in the public domain in doing so there are several key questions that must be answered by mr benn
8029053 placing the evidence base in the public domain will go a long way to ensuring support on both sides of the border in the face of economic damage to both farms and businesses
8029054 ok i think if everyone just calms down we can all blah blah blah

8029060 your vision of where you are where youre going etc is what determines where youre going in life either individually or collectively since a lamp is something everyone can see your vision is something that can help inspire others on a collective level the churchs light beacon to the world is its vision of how things are now of where we are and ought to be going in the future
8029061 if therefore your eye is good your whole body will be full of light
8029062 if your vision is focused as it should be on the kingdom of heaven then all of you will be like brilliant lamps your way forward will be clear and youll be like shining guideposts to others
8029063 if your vision is twisted away from the light of god your way forward will be unclear also no one will see you or benefit from your example or if they do see you it will be as something dark something to avoid
8029064 if therefore the light that is in you is darkness how great is that darkness
8029065 if your knowledge of the kingdom of heaven and the things of god and the guidance of the holy spirit within you is obscured you can neither see your way or be a help to others what a tragedy that is
8029066 your vision of where you are where youre going etc is what determines where youre going in life either individually or collectively since a lamp is something everyone can see your vision is something that can help inspire others on a collective level the churchs light beacon to the world is its vision of how things are now of where we are and ought to be going in the future if your vision is focused as it should be on the kingdom of heaven then all of you will be like brilliant lamps your way forward will be clear and youll be like shining guideposts to others if your vision is twisted away from the light of god your way forward will be unclear also no one will see you or benefit from your example or if they do see you it will be as something dark something to avoid if your knowledge of the kingdom of heaven and the things of god and the guidance of the holy spirit within you is obscured you can neither see your way forward or be a help to others what a tragedy that is
8029067 i never took a position in the primary even in the south carolina primary i never took a position i made no commitments to anybody
8029068 so if anybody got a problem with that tough this 68 year old could care less about how anybody feels how i conducted myself because i did it in an honorable way and i am proud of it
8029069 having a dem congress oppose mccain policies may well be preferable to an obama muddle
8029070 i sure am glad that biden is on board i was worried about obamas foreign policy credentials
8029071 well if this party has a message it has done a hell of a job of hiding it tonight i promise you that
8029072 david gergen said this a short time ago that in the first two hours what is the message
8029073 im not sure it happened that way but i know its all true
8029074 his need to feel more causative and to have a wide
8029075 the decision to go to war was the right one
8029076 i believe president bushs strong rhetorical support for democracy has made a difference by creating space for and emboldening modernizers and moderates
8029077 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8029078 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8029079 how pleased we are with life is not merely determined by what happens to us
8029080 it is also determined by what we expect to happen to us

8029088 he said here in ghana people think they are witches we are afraid of them
8029089 mostly it was a desperately impoverished village not unlike many in ghana
8029090 that old lady she has cursed you she is a witch never give ride to old ladies
8029091 when you get to the village listen to what the drunk man says its true
8029092 he hears everything and because he is drunk no one minds him even if he were to drink water it would turn to akpeteshi in his blood

8029096 at the first fall of snow the whole family gathers round the stove lies down ceases to wrestle with the problems of human existence and quietly goes to sleep once a day every one wakes up to eat a piece of hard bread the members of the family take it in turn to watch and keep the fire alight after six months of this reposeful existence the family wakes up shakes itself
8029097 these vigorous men will now spend their days in bed packing their bodies tightly together in order to stay warm and to eat less food they weaken themselves deliberately
8029098 i am unable to moderate this forum properly at this time due to the house move and lack of internet connection bt have promised next weekend at which point this forum will resume operation
8029099 a medical practitioner must explain the likelihood of success and the risks of agreeing to a medical procedure in language that the patient can understand and give the patient as much information as he or she needs to make an informed decision including any risk that a reasonable person would consider important in deciding to have the proposed treatment or procedure the patient must be told about any risk of death or serious injury or significant potential complications that may occur if the procedure is performed a medical practitioner is not required to explain minor risks that are not likely to occur

8029116 today were announcing the launch of ubiquity a mozilla labs experiment into connecting the web with language in an attempt to find new user interfaces that could make it possible for everyone to do common web tasks more quickly and easily
8029117 sorry i was just thinking about some shit last week me and my girl had a baby you know thats why she hasnt been around for a while shes self concious or some shit i would be too she looks like a fuckin walrus but anyway there we are in the hospital im holding her hand shes screaming her head 0ff and i start to see its head coming out this big fucking mellon head and shes screaming and squeezing my hand and all the male nurses in the room are giving me thumbs up and congratulations dad and whatever and all i can think is i cant afford this fucking thing if i could afford condoms you think i would be having a fucking kid that thing is gonna starve to death and i was just thinking you know maybe you could help me out
8029118 you want me to watch him i hate kids more than you do
8029119 i know that this is why i am coming to you remember when we were kids and we got all of those extension cords and played nintendo 64 in your tree fort
8029120 yeah it overloaded the circuit and caught on fire we almost burnt my house down
8029121 and we would have if there was a proper accelerant
8029122 so in my house i got the proper accelerant im going out of town next week all im asking is that you come over and plug in an extension cord itll look like an accident
8029123 no this is the best way you dont get your hands dirty you dont have to look them in the eyes you just have to plug in an extension cord would you rather have the kid grow up in poverty have him suffer his whole life just because he crawled out of the wrong vagina thats fucked up

8029129 we the undersigned call upon the english chess federation to adopt a more democratic approach
8029130 you will see ian or michael moving down and brandon johnny john and many others moving in and out up front
8029131 when he was about 12 he did vomit all the time hed get really really sick
8029132 he was in the adelaide childrens hospital for seven weeks at one stage he didnt eat and we thought we were going to lose him
8029133 they took out his appendix thinking that it might be that but they realised that it wasnt
8029134 they gave us the option of putting him in a psychiatric ward to see if there was something psychological
8029135 we signed him out from hospital and then he would go a few months and then he would get sick again
8029136 wed always take him to hospital wed always do the proper thing but they couldnt get to the bottom of it until now
8029137 we have watched our son go through what we thought was cancer
8029138 my wife and i over the past two years have watched him vomit in buckets having nosebleeds and even his hair fell out in clumps at one stage
8029139 every time we saw him we saw symptoms he stayed with us for a while where we had to put a special air conditioner in one of the rooms because he would heat up so much in the middle of winter
8029140 he had this cold air conditioner blowing on him to try to keep the heat down as a professional minister ive stood in front of my congregation and cried and said to pray for my son
8029141 ive travelled the world asking people to pray for him can you imagine what a horrible thing it would be if i was playing a game
8029142 to be honest i ask myself as a father what did i miss what did i not do
8029143 but i think you get immeasurable value from spending time on the trade show floor its such an opportunity to exchange new ideas uncover new technologies and also gauge whos really doing a good job of marketing i always give people my business card so i can see the different ways they follow up and try to build on that initial encounter
8029144 not only is dm measurable but canada post allows for a lot more creative flexibility now die cut envelopes dimensional pieces so im interested to see the creative executions that come out of the broadening our specs
8029145 i think our industry has already done a good job with regards to incorporating recycling and more environmentally friendly production practices but with the renewed interest in the environment what are audience perceptions of marketing initiatives
8029146 we work hard to stay apprised of new tools and technologies that will best serve our clients and keep our leadership position in this area
8029147 for instance some of my colleagues just returned from the marketing sherpa e mail summit in florida and there are some cool things going on in this area that we have incorporated it will be an interesting proxy for the cma to see how and if these innovations are translating to the canadian marketplace
8029148 im not convinced that its important to always find something new
8029149 sometimes its just as important to be reminded about a tactic thats fallen off your radar or has taken on a new twist you werent aware of
8029150 when youre so tightly connected to your business and your clients it can be difficult to take a step back and think about whats happening outside your sphere and how it can affect your business so i really do try to take the few days during the cma show to take advantage of the opportunity to get reconnected with whats out there
8029151 one of the warnings about integration is that it cant be at the expense of focused subject matter expertise
8029152 for instance i dont think you can let an agency that specializes in above the line strategies tell you how to build program a content driven website and not all marketers understand the rich deep principles of dm
8029153 so instead of prompting a trend towards one partner doing everything i think integration puts more responsibility on the client to manage multiple partners to get the best result for the brand and their total marketing effort
8029154 crm nirvana for me would be connecting all the various dots from the point a customer contacts a call centre to the customized package digitally printed in a way that responds to their exact needs
8029155 what integration means to me is bringing the power of relationship and brand building and measurement all together
8029156 it all comes down to customer interaction with your brand and dm as a measurable component is a natural complement to other channels that provide tangible results
8029157 when court may order testing for alcohol or illegal use of controlled substances in custody visitation or guardianship proceedings
8029158 its my space and ill skip a day if i want to
8029159 if the media outlets are covering this just because hes black thats the wrong reason
8029160 any time theres a presidential campaign it should be important to african americans and not just because one of the candidates is black
8029161 our mission is to celebrate african american culture and to chronicle african american achievement
8029162 when the year started this was not in our budget but when he became the presumptive nominee it just seemed like this was a sure thing for us
8029163 weve gotten folks who can discuss these issues and whats happening from all sides of the coin
8029164 there will be balance from people who can speak with passion
8029165 i really take offense to the charge that black journalists cant be objective there is the celebratory nature of the moment thats true
8029166 but were going to call the candidates on their agendas we cant give either of them a free pass we do have to keep in mind our demographic which is the 18 to 34 year old viewer and be responsive to that but that will not taint the integrity of the journalism that goes into it
8029167 the black press will provide a perspective and viewpoint you wont get from other press
8029168 just by definition covering the republican national convention doesnt fit into our mission and our viewers would not expect it
8029169 theres no need for us to bring a presence to an event if theres no african americans involved
8029170 there hasnt been the type of investment in collecting news about the state of black america that would balance and complement the news that comes from more mainstream outlets and given the role the rnc has played in the problems of this country i would think those networks would want to be there
8029171 during the debate season i would look at my ratings for those nights and they were lower while cnns and msnbcs were higher
8029172 it was clear my viewers were looking for information and for a place to talk about what is happening
8029173 people have to remember that tv one is not a news network
8029174 they cannot go to a convention like this and cover it like a news story if people are looking for a news element they should go to cnn i wonder if rush limbaugh will be broadcasting from the dnc i think not you have to analyze who you are
8029175 what do you think we could do to improve our site
8029176 i spent 5 1 2 years in a prison cell without i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair
8029177 i spent those 5 1 2 years not because i wanted to get a house when i got out
8029178 a rally by the minuteman civil defense corps featuring libertarian presidential candidate bob barr drew just a few dozen people
8029179 chewing turkey sandwiches and sitting in folding chairs at the almost empty rally
8029180 there has been a surge in the number of civilian casualties caused by all sides a spread of insecurity to previously stable areas and increasing attacks on aid agencies and their staff
8029181 future tense the law office in three to five years
8029182 ah je komt van de kapper je kortgeknipte haartjes hebben een rossige schijn
8029183 the universe is as infinite as my knowledge the odds of the earth being the only planet which supports life are so small that someone with a brain such as yours could not hope to understand them
8029184 fussball ist mehr als nur ein sport fussball ist euphorie religion und droge zugleich
8029185 i think it was probably some build up over some time i dont think it was exactly one thing i think it was something that over the course took over
8029186 i dont know its been about three or four weeks i think it just got to the point where we needed to find out if something was wrong it was something that if i keep playing with it something worse could end up happening
8029187 i want to but i also want for my foot to be right too id like to play now but its just something that happens and you deal with it when will i be ready to play your body usually lets you know
8029188 i think this has been the toughest obviously because of some injuries but more than that how the season has gone for us as a team its been tough but its part of the game things like this hopefully you learn from it and itll make you better
8029189 i felt like it was something i could deal with and play with its not something where it was really affecting myself if i felt like i was really hurting and couldnt help it might have been different but i think it just ended up being something more serious than we thought
8029190 mommie that cannot be true when did this really start
8029191 often the first place they go is to the fetish priest
8029192 my thoughts or those of my wife would be who is making my child sick
8029193 i am a christian and so i do not believe in such things
8029194 after the symptoms first appear the child has seven days to seek treatment
8029195 stoked to have won it especially the first round i must be riding loads better than i thought and now im mega keen for the first world cup in 2 weeks at maribor slovenia
8029196 there is a lot of speculation as to why cyclists or at least proper cyclists which is to say roadies shave their legs the answer is very simple the fact that you are hardcore enough to suffer public ridicule by dilapidating and then exposing a part of your body shows dedication to your sport smooth legs mark the difference between the serious racer and the enthusiastic but unsteady charity ride hero it shows whether a rider can be trusted to ride in a straight line or to veer wildly across the road while reaching for their drinks bottle and a following rider can judge this individual by the hirsuteness of their calves and afford them an appropriately wide berth all this proved very useful this morning as i embarked on a 66 mile ride round dorset for the british heart foundation i had arranged or at least when i say arranged i mean mentioned the idea of a group ride with the guys from work this was to be the biggest collection of charge plugs ever seen outside of our warehouse moving along like a dark blue express train scything its way through the country lanes however one by one everybody had cried off using some of the lamest excuses ever seen outside of a uci doping tribunal our peleton was rapidly whittled down to two one of whom failed to show on the actual day at the time of writing i havent heard his excuse though i suspect he was washing his hair leaving me standing at the startline on my own i mention no names but you know who you are and forever it will be to your shame so anyway it wasnt quite so bad as the time i went to a shakespearian themed fancy dress party dressed as one of the three witches in macbeth only to discover that the other two witches had stayed home to watch the telly but my mood was bordering on slightly miffed i had turned up in a prearranged outfit which while not actually fancy dress had a very definite retro lean with an old skool hairnet crash hat old skool briko sunglasses and old skool retro top my hilarious originality came up very short when i ran in to a guy also on a plug and so identically dressed that for a moment we came close to recreating the groucho marx mirror sketch my fixed gear doppelganger turned out to be a bloke called ben a very enthusiastic member of the bournemouth areas small but growing fixed gear community and while my plug was spec his had been blinged up with a miche crankset and hubs and cinelli tt bars he was heading off with his mates and the thought crossed my mind of riding with them but i chose otherwise still hanging on waiting for my work colleague i baulk at using the word mate another 20 minutes of waiting and i set off on my own or i say my own there were thousands out on the roads all of whom had to be weaved through for the first 10 miles there was a choice of 25 mile 50 mile and 66 mile routes with the majority of riders choosing the former this made the first section a bit like a cycling version of grand theft auto particularly the half a mile of unmade road that just had to be done flat out paris roubaix style weaving through families out for a gentle sunday trundle well so was i its just that mines a little faster i am what you could aspire to be i should have had that written across my arse my intention had been to do the 50 mile course but the split where the 50 turned left and the 66 right was manned by a friend of mine and rather than forego the massive loss of face that would have gone with taking the easy route i found myself going right 66 miles doesnt sound that bad when youre only 25 miles in and have the wind behind you i do 50 60 miles every weekend though thats on a nice light race bike with gears and a freewheel whatever way you look at it fixed gears are harder and if you call it not 66 miles but 110 kilometres it suddenly feels a lot more daunting and hot did i mention that well hot for england in may i stopped at practically every rest halt on the way to refill my water bottle that i was swigging from like a tramp with a bottle of white lightning i must have passed the same guy about five times shooting past him then pulling in to the rest halt filling up like kimi raikkonen and catching him back up again four or five times this all tool its toll fixed may be an urban phenomena not without good reason they suit cities very well and have infinitely more potential for dicking about than regular road bikes out here in the country though its a different world a geared bike may be vastly more efficient but with fixed you get that epic riding that puts you in touch with the pioneer days of cycling yes i want to heave my way up this hill on my hugely inappropriate gear yes i want the descent to make me pedal like im stuffing a ferret into a sack with my feet yes i want to use my entire toolkit just to fix a puncture im not so sure about the trendy length shorts on a day like this but ah hell i was too far from home to change them yes it was hot the wind was against me and the hills were starting to take their toll i had not hat under my hairnet helmet and my face had burnt a stripe half way up my forehead a time of under four hours was looking increasingly optimistic in fact things were staring to look bleak until around the next corner rolled my plug mounted friend and his buddies in one of those bizarre ruptures in space and time that happen in these sort of events

8029210 yes this is my cabin last night i accidentally locked myself out i went to the treeline where i store my spare keys i heard something that frightened me deeply so i took off running towards the door the last thing i remember was heavy footsteps running behind me and a sharp pain in the back of my head it was you
8029211 you are delusional yes it was me who struck you but only because i thought you were a thief in these woods one does not take lightly the discovery of an unwelcome guest and how exactly is it that you think this cabin is yours i have lived in this cabin for thirty years

8029246 review all aspects of chess activity and organisation in the uk taking into account the various interests of all levels and groups of players both amateur and professional together with organisers and sponsors
8029247 the committee was unanimous in agreeing that the bcf is designed for a structure of british chess that is largely superseded it recognised that the cumbersome structure with an unwieldy council and management board was ill equipped to handle the increase in professional chess of the worlds number two chess nation difficulties in recent years in finding and keeping sponsors have resulted from the lack of professional commercial management the major recommendations of the report are 1 to appoint a competent professional full time general secretary 2 to start a national league 3 to reform the management structure of the bcf to simplify the organisation and improve communication to members
8029248 the bcf is simply the sum of its parts individuals clubs and counties if what is commonly termed the grass roots then continually demands what does the bcf do for me as if expecting immediate benefits from above there is something intrinsically wrong the bcf can only be what its members make it
8029249 i think its serious its a serious situation but theres a lot of things we need to do we have a lot of work to do and im afraid its a very hard struggle particularly given the situation on the iraq pakistan border

8029288 arent tulips supposed to come back my grandmother has tulips that have bloomed every spring for as long as she can remember did i do something wrong
8029289 most are not strong perennializers they dont flower well the second year after planting
8029290 holland is further north than newfoundland which is over 300 miles north of the tip of maine
8029291 all of this tlc yields a high percentage of flowering size bulbs including many top size bulbs the cream of the crop which measure 12 centimeters in circumference and sometimes larger
8029292 a top size bulb cant get bigger but it will get smaller typically by splitting into two or more smaller bulbs
8029293 under less than perfect garden conditions when the bulbs split into smaller bulbs those smaller bulbs are unlikely ever to grow to flowering size
8029294 some may also rot due to heavy soil or excess moisture and so your breathtaking tulip display dwindles to little or nothing that said i have a few red tulips that have bloomed every spring for 10 years they just refuse to give up
8029295 eventually flowering becomes sparse but you may get two or three good displays before you feel the need to replant
8029296 people plant them because at 35 to 45 cents a bulb they wont break the bank compared to other leisure activities planting bulbs is less expensive takes less time is longer lasting and more beautiful when you look at it that way even a one shot tulip gives a great return on investment
8029297 they release their nutrients slowly which means those nutrients are more likely to be taken up by the bulbs and less likely to become pollutants in the environment

8029334 the creativity of the program the friendliness of the staff and the organization of the camp coordinator heather are exceptional we look forward to returning to discovery camp next summer

8029341 planting encore azaleas in a location that lacks adequate sunlight is the biggest but easiest mistake to make
8029342 monitor sunlight periodically from morning to late afternoon be certain that the spot you select offers a steady stream of sunlight for at least four hours
8029343 when selecting a site for your azalea dont forget to take into consideration the shade bearing trees planted nearby
8029344 watering wisely is something that we all want to be conscious of these days
8029345 the good news is that its easy if a few careful steps are taken
8029346 water thoroughly when needed once to twice a week preferably in the early evening or afternoon when the suns intensity begins to decline this is the best way to ensure maximum water uptake
8029347 having spent most of my life growing and breeding azaleas ive seen the enormous effect an appropriate well balanced diet has on an azalea larger blooms extended bloom seasons enhanced disease resistance lush foliage and overall performance
8029348 always make sure before you apply fertilizer that the azalea is well hydrated and that the soil is moist
8029349 i love that this fertilizer takes the guesswork out of feeding by releasing just the right amount of nutrients into the soil at the right time
8029350 this smart release technology allows me to feed well but less often which is convenient for me and better for the environment
8029351 because of their expertise in release technology for plants that have extended bloom seasons
8029352 while very light pruning of small branches can be done most anytime on azaleas heavy pruning and shaping which will encourage vigorous growth should be reserved for springtime
8029353 bear in mind that encore azaleas require very little pruning to retain good form
8029354 if you think your encore azalea needs to be pruned do so immediately after the spring flowering for maximum bud set
8029355 well son what do want to be when you grow up
8029356 well first you have to become prisoner of war and get tortured for 5 5 years

8029368 there has been widespread market acceptance of isuzus all new models since their release with a strong selling point being the ranges strong environmental performance
8029369 in recent times the truck market and our society in general has become increasingly concerned about environmental issues and adopting ways in which we can minimise our footprint and in this regard the new isuzu range stands alone from competitors particularly our n and f series trucks
8029370 operators of new gen trucks identified with the breathe easy livery are bringing isuzus environmental benefits to the attention of customers business partners and other road users while also letting others know of their own commitment to the environment
8029371 several high profile companies along with numerous councils have expressed their interest in adorning their fleets with the breathe easy livery
8029372 their trucks are in the public view and as industry and opinion leaders they are interested in portraying a strong image of corporate citizenship
8029373 in many cases the purchase of new low emission isuzu trucks is part of a wider organisational scheme or policy to reduce environmental impact and they are keen to publicly confirm this commitment is being met by having their new trucks adorned with breathe easy livery
8029374 it looked like his head just exploded right around the time mike castle was making his announcement
8029375 senior leaders have taken the view that the anti incumbency factor works mostly against the sitting mlas of the ruling party as the party has been sitting on the opposition benches for a decade the sitting party legislators stand to gain with the strong undercurrent against the ruling party
8029376 there is no going back on the stand that those who contested the mcd elections will miss out on the assembly polls
8029377 the bjp will also field four to five sikh candidates in the assembly polls so the alliance together will put up around eight to nine candidates from the community to justify the demand of 10 per cent seats on the basis of the population

8029404 one of the top tricks of great gardeners is to plant in the fall
8029405 establishing most plants in the fall is easy and an excellent way to ensure theyll be successful in the spring
8029406 the weather and soil conditions are better in the fall as opposed to spring when it tends to be cold muddy and wet
8029407 fall is an excellent time for planting and roses are no exception
8029408 the right plant in the right spot means longer life with less care and use of natural resources
8029409 and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8029410 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8029411 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law

8029494 somethings wrong with the economy and has been all along
8029495 not having any training in economics im probably over my head here but
8029496 research by a kansas state university professor shows that household surveys predict the inflation rate fairly accurately and as well as professional economists the pros employ statistics like the unemployment rate money supply growth and exchange rate changes consumers participating in surveys are more likely to think about how much they spent at the grocery store that week
8029497 how do our measurements distinguish between buying a school bus and buying a humvee blowing it up in iraq and replacing it which is better according to these measurements
8029498 the share of households earning a middle class income of between 35 000 and 100 000 in real 2007 dollars has indeed shrunk slightly compared to a decade ago but so too has the share earning less than 35 000 a year while the share earning more than 100 000 continues to rise
8029499 though 2007 was the sixth and likely the final year of an economic expansion poverty was significantly higher the median income of non elderly households significantly lower and the number and percentage of americans who are uninsured substantially greater than in 2001

8029572 i would like to quote a few words by a very famous and celebrated orator journalist soldier historian and statesman people have said he might have made a great actor if he tried that winston churchill he said the idea that a nation can tax itself into prosperity is one of the crudest delusions which has ever befuddled the human mind now i dont know how that quote happened to catch my eye
8029573 in 20 years the federal budget increased five fold and the cost of welfare grew ten fold but that didnt help many local governments which lost effective control of their communities it didnt help small businesses hit by the highest interest rates in a hundred years it didnt help the working poor and pensioners flattened by double digit inflation and taxation
8029574 the decrease in poverty i referred to earlier started in the 1950s by the time the full weight of the great society programs was felt economic progress for americas poor had come to a tragic halt
8029575 wherever we went and wherever we looked we saw children in significant numbers who were hungry and sick
8029576 we commend chairman barbara boxer for her leadership and commitment to this issue
8029577 we urge the senate to pass this crucial piece of legislation that will put us on a path to continue to confront americas climate challenge
8029578 with all the irrefutable evidence we now have corroborating that climate change is real dangerous and proceeding faster than many scientists predicted this is the year for congress to move this critical legislation
8029579 if we fail to start substantially reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the next couple of years we risk bequeathing a diminished world to our grandchildren insect borne diseases such as malaria will spike as tropical ecosystems expand hotter air will exacerbate the pollution that sends children to the hospital with asthma attacks food insecurity from shifting agricultural zones will spark border wars and storms and coastal flooding from sea level rise will cause mortality and dislocation
8029580 in my 28 years in the senate i have focused above all on issues of national security and i see the problem of global climate change as fitting squarely within that focus
8029581 today we introduced a balanced bill senator lieberman and i found a good sound starting point that sends a significant signal that the u s is serious about taking a leadership role in reducing its greenhouse gas emissions
8029582 as we move forward with debate over this mammoth new legislation there are many unanswered questions that congress should examine closely the bill appears to implement a 6 7 trillion program that could undermine economic growth raise energy costs for american consumers and send jobs overseas to countries such as india and china we need a thoughtful and serious debate on how to be the best stewards of the environment possible as we do this i hope congress pays heed to the law of unintended consequences including what impact it might have on the budgets of families in texas and across the country

8029615 i dont know what it cost the city to get the dnc to come here but i know it wasnt cheap
8029616 we were expecting a bigger turnout too and maybe that will happen at the end of the week when obama gives his speech but the vendors i talk to are struggling it should be an excellent opportunity
8029617 not only did north carolina get front and center attention of course we had great pride that our senator was on that ticket
8029618 you talk about somebody who stood up for the blue collar voters the workers out there for people in poverty that was john edwards voice
8029619 i think it made a big difference in this election and its too bad the circumstances are such that his presence at the convention is not going to happen
8029620 i dont see any reason at this point to be talking about the recent unfortunate events
8029621 the focus this week is the obama family the way he wants to lead us in a new direction and biden and his family so thats really what i think is our emphasis
8029622 i know there are a lot of people who are angry but they know the devastation he has done to himself i dont think theres anybody who wants recriminations enough of them have already happened and hes going to be suffering about this for a long time

8029627 the gains that occurred last year were welcome but unfortunately they are too little too late
8029628 the median household is no better off now than they were back in 2000 despite their deep contribution to the nations economic growth during this period
8029629 the american work force is baking a bigger economic pie but the slices havent grown at all
8029630 its clear that the long period of strong economic growth we were in had a positive impact for most americans
8029631 obviously today were dealing with higher energy prices and the downturn in housing but the economy is showing enough resilience to keep growing in spite of those challenges
8029632 presidents like to take credit when things go well and therefore they should get the blame when things dont go well but there are lots of things driving this not all of which are home grown
8029633 the oil shocks are not and globalization which on balance is good for the country leaves winners and losers
8029634 private insurance has been falling and public insurance definitely went up
8029635 the number of uninsured is considerably higher than when the president took office and in each year since then employer sponsored insurance has continued to diminish
8029636 i think its more like we are seeing a tide that i dont think anybody can easily fix particularly in the small business sector
8029637 i had never realized the train had any potential of leaving while we were on the stairs and the door was open

8029697 it is important in cup ties when you play lower league opposition that you score early
8029698 that releases the pressure because the pressure is on you no matter what people say
8029699 when you go out there is pressure to perform but i dont think we can have any complaints we performed

8029718 the crew reported no injuries and they are now evacuating the aircraft
8029719 but we are saying it has been compounded in this country because nobody has faith in where this government is headed
8029720 but we were able to put forward policies which dealt with those issues and got us through the woods
8029721 the problem now is that sure these international factors exist as they did when we were in government
8029722 but it is the governments incapacity to deal with them which is really scaring business at the moment

8029725 what i would like to see him do is focus on the real economic issues
8029726 hes got to tell the australian people why he wants to raise a raft of new inflationary taxes when the government already has a huge surplus when inflation is elevated and every one of these taxes will put upward pressure on inflation
8029727 the objective of good government is for government to raise no more money than it needs
8029728 i think its important from time to time that the prime minister take the opportunity at venues like the press club to outline and update our plans for the future
8029729 im not about to blow the lid on whats about to be said today but we have a clear agenda following on from the commitment we made at the last election
8029730 we are pleased with the performance of the business in what is a challenging environment

8029732 police needed to reshuffle so that the officers who were on duty since yesterday tuesday can take a rest i still insist that as of now police will not use force to disperse protesters
8029733 this is the time that the authorities will storm into the government house
8029734 they know they cannot let protesters stay because we will make trouble for the government there are a lot of people who want to join us but have been blocked by the police
8029735 they the pad want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and stage a coup again
8029736 i will not resign i will stay to protect this country
8029737 in fact wed like to see it go a little bit further

8029741 despite uncertainties in the global environment we are expecting earnings per share in the range of 35 0 to 38 0 cents per share for 2008 09

8029746 while the uk faces a number of challenges in the short term rotary is positioned to benefit from the ongoing government commitment to invest in education health and urban renewal programmes which are relatively unaffected by an economic downturn

8029748 i was probably treated as well as i was because im an american i was certainly treated much better than they would have treated a chinese journalist
8029749 you would think that when youre getting off the plane in new york someone from the government would be standing there wanting to know what happened
8029750 we were meeting with some people who were planning the protests to get information on when these things were going to take place
8029751 from what we can piece together someone must have been following us
8029752 there were a ton of police there waiting to take us away and cctv the state run television was there too photographing us im told we were all over chinese tv
8029753 we were held in separate rooms and non stop interrogated for 22 hours the major issue they had with me and conley was that what we were doing taking and broadcasting photographs was a worse crime than the people who were holding a sign because we were broadcasting it for the world to see and thats a bigger crime in china than the protesters who were breaking the law
8029754 he started slapping me on the side going back and forth hitting me it wasnt that hard but after 16 hours of being questioned and no sleep it sort of shakes you up
8029755 were not sure whether to slit your throat or to shoot you
8029756 the next day they came and got him and took him away
8029757 i already had a return airline ticket but they would not let me use it
8029758 they forced me to buy a 4 000 one way return ticket to leave

8029774 theres a lot of us who feel pissed and angry at the party for the way hillary was treated there was a lot of sexism in the media and the whole process seemed rigged against her
8029775 at the moment i dont know who i am voting for i want to be able to forgive barack obama but what happened to hillary bugs me i dont know though that i could bring myself to vote for a republican
8029776 i was unhappy and upset that she lost but im going to be voting for obama in november
8029777 hes a brilliant leader and we have to have unity in the party to win the election
8029778 im disappointed hurt and angry about hillary but im not deluded

8029811 with the collapse of the soft wood industry in the interior of bc and the alberta oil fields slowing down the pressure on the housing market bubble in bc seems to have taken its toll
8029812 i feel sorry for the young first time buyers it is reminiscent of the 1980s when tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people lost their homes as the mortgage was considerably higher than the market value and banks refused to renew mortgages without large cash lump sums paid against existing mortgages to get the mortgage price below the market price by 25 as the panic set in

8029889 we have a big enough issue with some of the really low power transmitters like cell phones
8029890 we never want to be putting out enough power that we would in any way impact safety
8029891 the problem was that if you moved it a fraction of a degree you could melt a city

8029895 bill clinton appeared to undermine sen barack obama again tuesday
8029896 the former president speaking in denver posed a hypothetical question in which he seemed to suggest that that the democratic party was making a mistake in choosing obama as its presidential nominee
8029897 he said suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y

8029903 the life of an aviator seemed to me ideal it involved skill it brought adventure it made use of the latest developments of science mechanical engineers were fettered to factories and drafting boards while pilots have the freedom of wind with the expanse of sky there were times in an aeroplane when it seemed i had escaped mortality to look down on earth like a god
8029904 at the moment rugby is my saviour i let that do the talking thats how i express my expressions
8029905 if im representing the all blacks im an all black 24 7 so ive got to realise that i cant be out at the wee small hours of the morning and doing what i was doing and thats probably come to my senses now
8029906 if i get those things corrected ill be a better man for it
8029907 its only been two months and i think this is the easy part its going to be later down the track when its six to nine months when things will get tough
8029908 you know its easy for me to sit here now and say im clean and i havent done this and i havent done that but its not that easy i am happy with where im at at the moment though
8029909 as i said im very fortunate rugbys probably been my saviour because i was pretty close to losing it at one stage
8029910 it seems a little bit old fashioned sticking up a train its unfortunate that someone had to die in the situation

8029913 the board is working toward a substantial release of value to shareholders in 2010 which will coincide with gpgs 20th anniversary and my own retirement as chairman of the company
8029914 arguably misplaced investment judgment where prospects of recovery are more remote and where cost exceeds market value
8029915 that is supported by substantial undrawn credit lines so gpg is well placed for selective buying opportunities
8029916 there is also a deferred tax adjustment of 22 million which is purely international financial reporting standards nonsense and can be safely disregarded as a legitimate inclusion in any proper analysis of the result
8029917 brynn and nikki got on a fund raising squad and were short several revenue so they chose to enquire me whenever id like a carwash i admitted and then went to employment they acquired all wet cleaning my automobile soap and h2o conking out their torsos tasty then i caught brynn looking by my glove box she found a few wrong things to say the least and i asked to penalize her

8029929 once the team management and the swimmers and nzoc get back in the country well meet with them and review everything and decide at that stage whether any further action is necessary
8029930 im just really keen to make sure something silly like this doesnt overshadow the incredible performances that they had
8029931 whether its a cycling team or a swimming team its made pretty clear to them what the code of conduct is and clearly something like this probably breaches that
8029932 for something like this to put a dampener on it is a real shame
8029933 inappropriate and foolhardy behaviour at the end of a long campaign
8029934 its something that both swimming new zealand and the nzoc will have to address its not something that can be ignored
8029935 any time protocol isnt followed it has to be addressed
8029936 nobody pets them nobody talks to them half the time nobody gives them water or food breaks you heart
8029937 they are just kept in the you know minimum conditions to keep them alive and breathing but not a high quality of life

8029951 s lo en la regi n de ucayali en las provincias de coronel portillo y padre abad existen 60 000 hect reas para los cultivos que sirven para biocombustibles eso es algo muy interesante
8029952 en el pasado hemos cometido graves errores de confundir desarrollo con tala y quema de bosques y que desarrollar la amazon a significa hacer carreteras pero talando y quemando bosques o para hacer agricultura o ganader a esto no ha dado los resultados esperados
8029953 el segundo punto a considerar es la competencia de biocombustibles con alimentos tenemos que reflexionarlo much simo porque no podemos decir despu s que est n escaseando algunos productos alimenticios por sustituir los cultivos por productos para biocombustibles
8029954 en la costa norte uno de los conflictos que puede surgir es que se produzcan enfrentamientos por el uso del agua en ciertas cuencas donde hay agricultores que tienen miedo de ser privados del recurso agua entonces las reglas deben ser muy estrictas

8029956 me molesta que cuando gana cristal la prensa siempre sale y dice que lo hizo con la ayuda del rbitro y dejan a un lado todo lo bueno que hizo el equipo eso me parece muy injusto y mezquino porque no quieren reconocer el trabajo que cumplen los jugadores en la cancha eso se ha convertido en una constante
8029957 se trata de un buen equipo y como tal merece todo nuestro respeto pienso que el torneo est muy parejo y cualquier cosa puede pasar la cosa viene muy dura para todos

8029964 no se ha pagado las adendas a los m dicos del interior del pa s no se ha nivelado a los cesantes y jubilados no se ha reconocido el derecho de los m dicos residentes no se ha nivelado a los m dicos del minsa con los de la seguridad social no se ha iniciado la construcci n del sistema nico de salud del pa s que se hab a comprometido y no se ha incrementado ni un solo centavo del presupuesto

8029968 these new estimates are a major advance in poverty measurements because they are based on far better price data for assuring that the poverty lines are comparable across countries
8029969 the sobering news that poverty is more pervasive than we thought means we must redouble our efforts especially in sub saharan africa
8029970 are pretty convincing that were going to see increases in poverty as a result of food and fuel prices
