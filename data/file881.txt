8810003 i think the osbournes to a degree tarnished the publics perception of my dad as a bit of a senile funny bumbling guy
8810004 my dads not an idiot hes nothing short of a genius in my opinion

8810008 ben stiller is one of the great talents of american entertainment a memorable actor an accomplished director and writer an emmy award winner and an innovative producer
8810009 the bottom line is we dont have a job if we dont entertain
8810010 in my mind thats as big a part of the job as shooting under par
8810011 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience

8810015 unisys could sublet if they want theyre in at 29 75 a square foot well one and two liberty are now advertising to the extent they have space available at all for 30 a square foot
8810016 the question is whether they could find a single tenant or would have to multitenant the space
8810017 and with the money they could lose subletting the floor they could buy a lot of advertising on billboards in downtown philadelphia to get their name out
8810018 unisys knows theres other good reasons to be downtown because of the labor pool the excitement the synergies to be in the city

8810026 was that the travellers would say that they search in their native language but instead most of them admitted they were forced to search in english since the travel sites often do not give them a multilingual option
8810027 and they dont speak english so for me to give them advice through the internet i have to have spanish content to show them so i prefer multilingual
8810028 the english language either doesnt work or wasnt well prepared to translate all the words on the website and i think thats the problem with polish websites is that theyre not well prepared to look for something in english
8810029 that matter the thai and vietnamese sons you are photod with weekly too

8810034 if nelson rockefeller hadnt bought the place there wouldnt be a club
8810035 theyre all over a hundred and it isnt even a club thats why they call it the century association
8810036 they put a tag on everybody i guess they have to they never say theyre dining with so and so its always so and so president of such and such and then they both deduct each other from their income tax
8810037 they get some fellow who doesnt know the first thing about clubs and the first thing he knows hes in there and then where is he
8810038 its everybody and his friends why they even have two entirely different crowds its textile men at lunch and lawyers at dinner they never even speak to each other
8810039 they can talk about their library all they want its a rather crowded and not very exclusive hotel nobody knows who anybody is and half the time nobodys even heard of the college theyre from its like a cemetery in there at night and at lunch time its like jones beach
8810040 they do nothing but drink and gamble and talk about their rice pudding
8810041 who wants to join a club on account of rice pudding
8810042 theyre always telling you about their big shot executives and how strong they are out of town they have to be i guess because in new york nobody even knows where they are
8810043 i had to go over there a year ago and tell them it was their fiftieth anniversary
8810044 i could take you up there for lunch it wouldnt be a good lunch i mean to say and it wouldnt be a bad lunch i mean to say it just wouldnt be anything
8810045 that chooses its members mentally now isnt that a hell of a way to run a club
8810046 men whose personality is not remarkably brilliant and who standing by themselves would not he apt to arouse a great deal of enthusiasm among their associates on account of their intellectual capacity
8810047 very frequently counteract these drawbacks by joining a well known club thus it will be seen that a club often lends a generous hand to persons who with out this assistance might ever remain in obscurity
8810048 i never did find out who the first one was
8810049 the only reason i got into the century in 1931
8810050 was because they thought i was john nicholas brown the worlds richest baby

8810055 that the union club has come to a day when a man can bring his mistress to the club

8810057 engaged in or interested in the liberal arts or professions
8810058 the colony has had very little to talk about anyway

8810061 who wants to go into a dining room where youre the only one there except for thomas j watson whos explaining to someone how he got eisenhower to be president of columbia
8810062 i dont know what clubs alfred belongs to and whats more i dont think he does either
8810063 at the metropolitan or the union league or the university
8810064 you might do a 10 000 deal but youd use the knickerbocker or the union or the racquet for 100 000 and then for 1 000 000 youd move on to the brook or the links
8810065 is sort of like english titles to an american theyre still very impressive but to an englishman the earl of warwick isnt necessarily any more social than just plain mister charles winn

8810068 the acid test of whether a man is a desirable member of a club is whether when you meet him in the club you are glad to see him
8810069 i think the best word i can use is were just trying to get some closure
8810070 we never want to send anyone out there thats not 100 percent were no more pessimistic about him today than we were but when he goes out there again we want him to be able to pitch with peace of mind
8810071 just day to day were going to keep checking be smart with it
8810072 were not talking about the end of a season were talking about the end of a career when youre dealing with a pitchers arm
8810073 were just dealing with it the best way we can i dont think we can do anything different
8810074 i cant go into specifics as i dont have the full facts but according to the town and country planning act tcpa 1976 such land can be used only for the purposes specified in the layout plan presented by the developer
8810075 any attempt to amend that use will require a public hearing and i doubt this was done judging from how the previous administration was doing things
8810076 even after the hearing is held we will ultimately decide on the propriety of the development guided by the principles of public interest
8810077 whether its urgency a must or a need weve got to win some ball games
8810078 its no secret were running out of time theres no margin for error
8810079 that ball everyone in the stadium and everyone else thought it was out except the left fielder its a game of inches
8810080 i didnt even look at it that catch was the game
8810081 pick your poison it was either chipper or him its a decision you make sometimes it works and sometimes it gets you mccann is a major league hitter and an all star and he got us
8810082 thats what we were laughing about two in a row whoo
8810083 i was just kind of looking in one zone for a pitch to hit
8810084 you always want to be in that spot to be able to drive in the winning run any time you can get a hit like that its fun
8810085 weve been through some tough times the last month and a half we didnt play well or swing the bat well thats part of it tonight we got some big hits thats contagious when everybody is struggling at the same time thats contagious too
8810086 hes had success this year and confidence grows from that
8810087 were on a long road trip and weve been battling things a lot ourselves so were just trying to figure out how to do a little better job on the road trip
8810088 we know what happens here with us and the as its always a battle its always good baseball two teams that play the game the right way hustle bust their tails
8810089 youre certainly dealing with the reality that theres no way were going to be able to catch the angels so we just wanted to come out and win a ballgame
8810090 ive got to tip my hat to the boys they did some damage there in the eighth
8810091 i outlasted their starter and we got into their bullpen
8810092 we have 70 trucks certified and working right now that will probably grow to 120 in the next couple of days
8810093 its definitely always a concern but it does not change our plan right now
8810094 we are going to methodically approach this the right way
8810095 i would love to do a guitar hero movie if activision would ever let me im trying to convince them but why would you have a movie screw up such a huge franchise not that i would make a bad movie
8810096 the kid dropped out of school to play guitar hero for a living
8810097 as your names are called answer here step forward with your baggage and embark
8810098 that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
8810099 has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
8810100 i believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman
8810101 as a christian for me as a christian its also a sacred union
8810102 equality in relationship family and adoption rights is not some abstract principle thats why we have to repeal laws like the defense of marriage act thats why we have to extend equal treatment in our family and adoption laws
8810103 that matter the thai and vietnamese sons you are photod with weekly too
8810104 i replied that i was unable to receive an award from a government that had led russia into such dire straits
8810105 putin inherited a ransacked and bewildered country with a poor and demoralized people and he started to do what was possible a slow and gradual restoration these efforts were not noticed nor appreciated immediately in any case one is hard pressed to find examples in history when steps by one country to restore its strength were met favorably by other governments
8810106 today i continue to be extremely worried by the slow and inefficient development of local self government but it has finally started to take place in yeltsins time local self government was actually barred on the regulatory level whereas the states vertical of power i e putins centralized and top down administration is delegating more and more decisions to the local population unfortunately this process is still not systematic in character
8810107 no i am not afraid of death any more when i was young the early death of my father cast a shadow over me he died at the age of 27 and i was afraid to die before all my literary plans came true but between 30 and 40 years of age my attitude to death became quite calm and balanced i feel it is a natural but no means the final milestone of ones existence
8810108 that all those other worlds are only being temporarily prevented by wicked governments or by heavy crises or by their own barbarity or incomprehension from taking the way of western pluralistic democracy and from adopting the western way of life countries are judged on the merit of their progress in this direction however it is a conception which developed out of western incomprehension of the essence of other worlds out of the mistake of measuring them all with a western yardstick the real picture of our planets development is quite different
8810109 the most striking feature which an outside observer notices in the west in our days
8810110 the western world has lost its civil courage both as a whole and separately in each country each government each political party and of course in the united nations
8810111 to an extent their fathers and grandfathers could not even dream about
8810112 even biology knows that habitual extreme safety and well being are not advantageous for a living organism
8810113 a statesman who wants to achieve something important and highly constructive for his country has to move cautiously and even timidly there are thousands of hasty and irresponsible critics around him parliament and the press keep rebuffing him as he moves ahead he has to prove that every single step of his is well founded and absolutely flawless actually an outstanding and particularly gifted person who has unusual and unexpected initiatives in mind hardly gets a chance to assert himself from the very beginning dozens of traps will be set out for him thus mediocrity triumphs with the excuse of restrictions imposed by democracy
8810114 destructive and irresponsible freedom has been granted boundless space society appears to have little defense against the abyss of human decadence such as for example misuse of liberty for moral violence against young people motion pictures full of pornography crime and horror it is considered to be part of freedom and theoretically counter balanced by the young peoples right not to look or not to accept life organized legalistically has thus shown its inability to defend itself against the corrosion of evil
8810115 and what shall we say about the dark realm of criminality as such legal frames especially in the united states are broad enough to encourage not only individual freedom but also certain individual crimes the culprit can go unpunished or obtain undeserved leniency with the support of thousands of public defenders when a government starts an earnest fight against terrorism public opinion immediately accuses it of violating the terrorists civil rights there are many such cases
8810116 such a tilt of freedom in the direction of evil has come about gradually but it was evidently born primarily out of a humanistic and benevolent concept according to which there is no evil inherent to human nature the world belongs to mankind and all the defects of life are caused by wrong social systems which must be corrected strangely enough though the best social conditions have been achieved in the west there still is criminality and there even is considerably more of it than in the pauper and lawless soviet society
8810117 the press too of course enjoys the widest freedom i shall be using the word press to include all media but what sort of use does it make of this freedom here again the main concern is not to infringe the letter of the law there is no moral responsibility for deformation or disproportion what sort of responsibility does a journalist have to his readers or to history if they have misled public opinion or the government by inaccurate information or wrong conclusions do we know of any cases of public recognition and rectification of such mistakes by the same journalist or the same newspaper no it does not happen because it would damage sales a nation may be the victim of such a mistake but the journalist always gets away with it one may safely assume that he will start writing the opposite with renewed self assurance
8810118 very well known representatives of your society say we cannot apply moral criteria to politics thus we mix good and evil right and wrong and
8810119 no weapons no matter how powerful can help the west until it overcomes its loss of willpower in a state of psychological weakness weapons become a burden for the capitulating side to defend oneself one must also be ready to die there is little such readiness in a society raised in the cult of material well being
8810120 how did the west decline from its triumphal march to its present sickness have there been fatal turns and losses of direction in its development it does not seem so the west kept advancing socially in accordance with its proclaimed intentions with the help of brilliant technological progress and all of a sudden it found itself in its present state of weakness
8810121 this means that the mistake must be at the root at the very basis of human thinking in the past centuries i refer to the prevailing western view of the world which was first born during the renaissance and found its political expression from the period of the enlightenment it became the basis for government and social science and could be defined as rationalistic humanism or humanistic autonomy the proclaimed and enforced autonomy of man from any higher force above him it could also be called anthropocentricity with man seen as the center of everything that exists
8810122 this new way of thinking which had imposed on us its guidance did not admit the existence of intrinsic evil in man nor did it see any higher task than the attainment of happiness on earth it based modern western civilization on the dangerous trend to worship man and his material needs everything beyond physical well being and accumulation of material goods all other human requirements and characteristics of a subtler and higher nature were left outside the area of attention of state and social systems as if human life did not have any superior sense that provided access for evil of which in our days there is a free and constant flow merely freedom does not in the least solve all the problems of human life and it even adds a number of new ones
8810123 however in early democracies as in american democracy at the time of its birth all individual human rights were granted because man is gods creature that is freedom was given to the individual conditionally in the assumption of his constant religious responsibility such was the heritage of the preceding thousand years two hundred or even fifty years ago it would have seemed quite impossible in america that an individual could be granted boundless freedom simply for the satisfaction of his instincts or whims subsequently however all such limitations were discarded everywhere in the west a total liberation occurred from the moral heritage of christian centuries with their great reserves of mercy and sacrifice state systems were becoming increasingly and totally materialistic the west ended up by truly enforcing human rights sometimes even excessively but mans sense of responsibility to god and society grew dimmer and dimmer in the past decades the legalistically selfish aspect of western approach and thinking has reached its final dimension and the world wound up in a harsh spiritual crisis and a political impasse all the glorified technological achievements of progress including the conquest of outer space do not redeem the twentieth centurys moral poverty which no one could imagine even as late as in the nineteenth century
8810124 as long as we wake up every morning under a peaceful sun we have to lead an everyday life there is a disaster however which has already been under way for quite some time i am referring to the calamity of a despiritualized and irreligious humanistic consciousness
8810125 we are now experiencing the consequences of mistakes which had not been noticed at the beginning of the journey on the way from the renaissance to our days we have enriched our experience but we have lost the concept of a supreme complete entity which used to restrain our passions and our irresponsibility we have placed too much hope in political and social reforms only to find out that we were being deprived of our most precious possession our spiritual life in the communist east it is destroyed by the dealings and machinations of the ruling party in the west commercial interests tend to suffocate it this is the real crisis the split in the world is less terrible than the similarity of the disease plaguing its main sections
8810126 it would be retrogression to attach oneself today to the ossified formulas of the enlightenment even if we are spared destruction by war our lives will have to change if we want to save life from self destruction we cannot avoid revising the fundamental definitions of human life and human society is it true that man is above everything is there no superior spirit above him is it right that mans life and societys activities have to be determined by material expansion in the first place is it permissible to promote such expansion to the detriment of our spiritual integrity
8810127 if the world has not come to its end it has approached a major turn in history equal in importance to the turn from the middle ages to the renaissance it will exact from us a spiritual upsurge we shall have to rise to a new height of vision to a new level of life where our physical nature will not be cursed as in the middle ages but even more importantly our spiritual being will not be trampled upon as in the modern era
8810128 this ascension will be similar to climbing onto the next anthropologic stage no one on earth has any other way left but upward
8810129 authoritarian rule has never had a place in america and i hope it never does the catholic church notwithstanding
8810130 i have never been fond of the tendency to mistake america the nation for the united states the ideological project
8810131 listen to all that the people are saying to you it is not you they have rejected but they have rejected me as their king as they have done from the day i brought them up out of egypt until this day forsaking me and serving other gods so they are doing to you now listen to them but warn them solemnly and let them know what the king who will reign over them will do
8810132 this is what the king who will reign over you will do he will take your sons and make them serve with his chariots and horses and they will run in front of his chariots some he will assign to be commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties and others to plough his ground and reap his harvest and still others to make weapons of war and equipment for his chariots he will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers he will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive groves and give them to his attendants he will take a tenth of your grain and of your vintage and give it to his officials and attendants your menservants and maidservants and the best of your cattle and donkeys he will take for his own use he will take a tenth of your flocks and you yourselves will become his slaves when that day comes you will cry out for relief from the king you have chosen and the lord will not answer you in that day

8810137 crucify to themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame
8810138 i think at the last day you may regret that post it is extraordinarily frivolous and impious
8810139 did not the apostle paul say that all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness 2 timothy 3 16
8810140 do we not see in christs use of the scripture e g get thee hence satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god matthew 4 10 the clear fact of biblical authority it was sufficient that it is written christ needed not to point to any hierarchy or action of man for his guarantee
8810141 and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it

8810143 as for fresh sacrifice come now why else are the altars stone i have to admit i do actually enjoy this one perhaps you could explain why the building material necessitates the heretical notion of a fresh sacrifice
8810144 the present discipline of the church requires that for the consecration of an altar it must be of stone
8810145 the church intends the mass to be regarded as a
8810146 if any one saith that in the mass a true and proper sacrifice is not offered to god or that to be offered is nothing else but that christ is given us to eat let him be anathema

8810155 power control is key to the mobile and network success if the ue user equipment requires too much downlink power then the base station or node b base station can run out of transmitter power and this is what was happening as you get more ues on the cell the noise floor rises and the cell has to compensate by ramping up its power to the ues
8810156 if the ue power control algorithm is faulty then they will demand more power from the cell than is necessary and with multiple users this can cause the cell transmitter to run out of power the net result is that some ues will drop their call i have seen the dropped call graphs that correspond to the iphone launch and when the 2 0 2 firmware was released the increase in dropped calls

8810159 i think our country needs to take into account the specific experiences and different types of experiences that hundreds of thousands of veterans have faced going to afghanistan over the last six years traditional education does not take that into account
8810160 i would never have gone back to school i dont know what i would have done with the rest of my life i probably would have continued to sit around my house playing with my dog

8810166 to be told i might not be able to play again and to make it back to the big leagues
8810167 we definitely have to play better well take the win but weve got to get better
8810168 it was great to see we knew we had a better football team than a year ago
8810169 to see it come out with a win tonight really makes us feel good its the kind of thing that will bring us even tighter together
8810170 we put this game on the offensive line we talked at halftime that this was the no 1 rush defense in the country last year and we wanted to out physical them we did that
8810171 we wanted to come out and give a great show for the fans and i think we did some great things on defense and some good things on offense
8810172 its a big ball game for this team and for south florida and an opportunity for us to go up there and play a great opponent
8810173 theyve got a tremendous offense tremendous defense and we feel great for the chance to go up there and play such a great team
8810174 things didnt happen the way we wanted but youve got to expect that out of any football game
8810175 especially when youre playing such a good opponent like miami
8810176 i put my teammates in positions that they could make plays not me
8810177 i learned if i could give the ball to my teammates everything will be ok i dont need to be the one going out there making spectacular plays
8810178 it felt like we had a junior or senior out there playing quarterback
8810179 theres just too many issues with this offense for people to deal with
8810180 we had two and a half weeks to deal with it the rest of these folks will get two days good luck acc
8810181 had dwyer in our sights about three times and just couldnt tackle him
8810182 we are a team that is very young and new to the big scene
8810183 41 points is a lot better than 14 im sure of that an ugly win is better than a pretty loss
8810184 in this offense you dont know when someone is going to break a long run

8810203 the percentage of federal employees with targeted disabilities which are severe physical or mental disabilities that historically have resulted in barriers to employment has declined each year since reaching a peak of 1 24 percent in fiscal years 1993 and 1994

8810218 i regret the harm this has caused my family my friends and this community
8810219 not at all convinced that sending defendants such as ward to prison is the best way to address the societal problem of child porn proliferating on the internet
8810220 amoral universally unacceptable and aberrant the governments court documents alleged that ward possessed images of sex acts on children as young as three years old and revealed his online exchanges with the dominatrix in which he discussed his sexual attraction to children
8810221 these images depicted these minors suffering the most horrific torment steve grocki a justice department lawyer who led the ward prosecution said to walker
8810222 what is profoundly sad is that bernie ward is a good man
8810223 god talk show on sunday mornings now hosted by san jose state professor brent waters who plans to discuss the child pornography issue on this sundays show kgo fired ward after the child porn charges came to light

8810226 its the verdict we hoped and prayed for its the verdict we felt was morally correct
8810227 i think you dont know what goes on in combat until you are in combat
8810228 this verdict will cause civilian prosecutors in other parts of the country to give pause before filing similar cases
8810229 i dont believe the law was enacted for the purpose of having civilian jurors assess the conduct of troops under fire during battle
8810230 we have every confidence that theyll do the right thing

8810236 add 50 town homes and 100 kids in the school system i dont think is a good idea
8810237 over 200 of these yellow signs have been put up neighbors say theyre to raise awareness especially when the case is now before a county judge
8810238 how are they going to use their office thats what this really comes down to its not so much the money that wasnt paid for the parking its how you use your official position
8810239 i made four promises we work in the field of public corruption with a public corruption unit weve done that
8810240 at every political function tom corbett is driven by a state paid driver in a state vehicle

8810242 we commend the u s department of justice criminal divisions computer crime and intellectual property section the u s attorneys offices for the western district of north carolina and the eastern district of virginia and the federal bureau of investigation for their work in bringing these criminals to justice

8810257 my 13 year old son does that gangsta chic nonsense and i am always hammering him for it
8810258 maybe mrs hopechange who seems to know what she is about when it comes to dressing can teach the young folk this basic basic life lesson i dont think you will see the obama girls sporting the muffin top on the front lawn of the white house

8810262 see that thats how bubba looked after his momma dressed him
8810263 my 13 year old son does that gangsta chic nonsense and i am always hammering him for it
8810264 you never know which part of the internet youll need the do you need sun cream part the whats the quickest way to the airport part the what about an ocean view room part or the can you really afford this part which is why all the parts of the internet are on the iphone

8810270 he has just been admitted for abdominal discomfort investigation will commence tomorrow morning and there is no cause for concern
8810271 we cannot tell you for how many days he will stay in the hospital at the moment
8810272 he is resting and has not had any visitor since he reached the hospital
8810273 i didnt get into this business to do the same thing over and over
8810274 its an attempt to put my destiny in my own hands
8810275 being a producer allows me to develop material that says something to me to make movies i can be proud of
8810276 if we characterized one side as all good or all bad you could write off the film as just another piece of action pabulum
8810277 i see it as a movie about truth we wanted to tell an entertaining story but also to bring out other issues issues that usually get ignored
8810278 one of the things that being an actor affords me is to travel around the world on somebody elses dime youre getting paid to study other people other disciplines other religions what ive found is that most human beings no matter what they believe want the same things safety for their kids protection a roof food
8810279 hes this very religious man who is never unsure of his relationship to god but that faith comes in conflict with what he sees as his duty i see him as a good guy but a good guy who has killed innocent people by his actions he really feels the burden of that hes violating one of the main tenets of his faith
8810280 pretty much left us alone to make the movie we wanted
8810281 you know if you have the money you can make whatever movie you like but successfully steering your film through the process of marketing and interfacing with the moviegoing audience thats tricky
8810282 i thought talk to me was a really good movie and maybe 11 people saw it i didnt want that to happen here
8810283 i guess the answer is that i want to be excited i want not to be able to anticipate what will happen next i dont want on page 10 to know what will happen on page 60 if i can figure it out so will the audience i want something that keeps me guessing
8810284 like i said i dont want to do the same thing over and over again but if you dont it runs counter to your getting lots of work the studios are looking for a brand because it makes the product easier to sell the actor becomes a brand
8810285 but thats not exciting to me which means that my job is always going to be a bit of a grind that im going to have to hustle a bit more
8810286 but at the end of the day i can say yeah im proud of this movie
8810287 the old guy that gave her some culture along the way
8810288 this is the second time and it is a record for the history of the festival we have five american films in competition
8810289 his sense of humor is bizarre but brilliant our kids loved him
8810290 eleven years ago when the etc was just a vision that randy and i were trying to make a reality ed generously shared with us his thoughts about how to prepare students for the new world of interactive digital media his suggestions including the idea of having everyone in the program study improvisational acting were priceless
8810291 the man who is employed for wages is as much a business man as his employer
8810292 sure of couse the education and health are shite but theres no point giving any more funding cause well only make an arse of it anyway
8810293 there is no shortage of cheap labour turkey isnt needed
8810294 a purpose connected with the commission preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism
8810295 of all the evil men of the balkans he is the worst
8810296 he stole the ground from under our feet and he took the sky from above our heads he killed our sons
8810297 we believe that the 12 executions were an isolated incident and not part of a strategy to destabilize the state
8810298 cubelet ice sonic ice the rabbit turd ice or nugget ice
8810299 can enhance your drinking experience by melting more slowly and is easy to chew once your drink is consumed
8810300 we have to respect his decision he was free to do what he wanted and it is a shame that he will not be joining us because he is a player that would have improved what is already a great team
8810301 but we have a superb side to start the league with and to play for all the aims that we have
8810302 madrids style of play is very much like the dutch national team where we like to attack and score goals
8810303 i looked at the fixtures and noticed straight away that west ham away was the third game in
8810304 the trip to upton park was the one that stood out to me for some reason i cant think why not long ago i was looking at the fixtures and thinking about darlington and rochdale no disrespect to them
8810305 now here i am looking at when we are going to be playing against manchester united and chelsea and west ham of course
8810306 what happened last saturday was not arsenal and we needed to show it could not happen again
8810307 you take in the criticism but the key is that we knew ourselves we were rubbish and that we could have done so much better now we need to show our real selves and we did well against twente
8810308 we knew that we did not put in the needed performance at fulham
8810309 but what happens in between games is not so important the crucial thing is to respond well in the next game which we did
8810310 now we have another big game against newcastle and we need another response to what has happened before
8810311 michael is a very special player he is very important to this club and my vision for it
8810312 if other people do not share that it is their problem
8810313 what the people heard that day people of every creed and colour from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8810314 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8810315 five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be out sourced
8810316 stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8810317 thats not the judgment we need that wont keep america safe we need a president who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past
8810318 i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
8810319 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8810320 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring
8810321 what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8810322 a lot of people have been saying its very difficult to attack a war hero but barack obama had a go
8810323 he said john mccain didnt know how ordinary americans lived and that he sided with george bush he showed anger
8810324 when the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 22 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way
8810325 he has trained well with bayern and he could make an appearance
8810326 he is fast dangerous in front of goal and has great vision
8810327 we will do our utmost to make ajax champions again
8810328 email is a mission critical tool for virtually every organization today and we are seeing an increasing trend to outsource this service
8810329 we apply our expertise in support and infrastructure so customers get all of the features and benefits they require without any of the day to day headaches of having to manage their own service
8810330 i also like fiorentina but everyone will finish behind us inter are still the best
8810331 hes the most complete coach ive ever had on the pitch and off it
8810332 hes meticulous about every little detial with us and it seems also with journalists
8810333 i heard him talking when he was at chelsea and after one and a half months of knowing him ive only positive things to say
8810334 you can see straight away the difference to other coaches now theres a new spirit the team has more confidence in itself
8810335 the beijing olympics marked the coming of age for the internet in china
8810336 cctv com attracted more than 100 million online visitors for the olympic games by providing the right content at the right time for a large and ever growing online audience
8810337 how many teams will beat manchester united and chelsea this year
8810338 i dont think theyll lose more than three games each without being a silly optimist how many points would you expect us to get from these opening three games
8810339 we took one point from them last season and that point was against manchester united when we got absolutely battered in the second half we played better against them this season and lost 1 0
8810340 it would be nice to get a point or three points up at everton but if youve got any brains how many points did people expect us to get from our first three games nine i dont think so unless youre an idiot
8810341 i will talk to the prime minister about this matter later today with the concrete evidence that she will know that these allegations are vile malevolent malicious and wrong
8810342 why would they never ever come and talk to me if they had an intention of coming to talk to me
8810343 kangaroo court of public opinion organised by the media in this country and others
8810344 reason to suspect that an investigation may reveal serious and complex fraud
8810345 it was clear to me then there were two quite different points of view at that point it becomes a matter between mr glenn and mr peters and the news media it is not a matter for me
8810346 i will talk to the prime minister about this matter later today with the concrete evidence that she will know that these allegations are vile malevolent malicious and wrong
8810347 why would they never ever come and talk to me if they had an intention of coming to talk to me
8810348 kangaroo court of public opinion organised by the media in this country and others
8810349 reason to suspect that an investigation may reveal serious and complex fraud
8810350 it was clear to me then there were two quite different points of view at that point it becomes a matter between mr glenn and mr peters and the news media it is not a matter for me
8810351 u charge simplifies the battery charging process for those who have more than 1 battery or more than 1 type of apple laptop

8810354 your girl doesnt like to feel in the blank what is she thinking she must not know what shes got
8810355 you have been a really naughty boy here is a really really wet bus ticket now try and smack yourself with it
8810356 if a group of indie kids pass a group of emos in town we wouldnt acknowledge them theyre just so whinny and irritating
8810357 i think thats why emo gets labelled whiny in heavy metal for example a lot of the themes revolve around crisis or struggle but also about overcoming that from strength you overcome adversity emo seems to be much more an expression of the struggle the actual depression itself
8810358 hannah was a happy 13 year old until she became an emo part of a sinister teenage craze that romanticises death three months later she hanged herself her devastated mother tells other parents no child is safe
8810359 its said that in any classroom theres probably two that are cutters and this is definitely something new in youth culture this whole fascination with the scarlet scream as some call it
8810360 they will slide through it and look back on it as a giggle
8810361 a world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams your misery and hate will kill us all so paint it black and take it back
8810362 i dont know what an adult emo would be like because ive never seen one
8810363 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction
8810364 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8810365 i felt so much for kerry and how wonderful a person she was
8810366 she did everything she could for people and loved animals and you couldnt have wished for a kinder more sincere person
8810367 the man directed bloodrayne ii for christs sake rev have you lost your freakin mind he gave tara reid a leading role as a scientist my god man what are you or him for that matter thinking
8810368 that people may know that you whose name is jehovah you alone are the most high over all the earth
8810369 i jehovah am your god the one teaching you to benefit yourself
8810370 as true as science is it is spiritually weak evolution seems crude and even quantum physics with all its unpredictable fluctuations offers anything but comfort and security
8810371 this means everlasting life their taking in knowledge of you the only true god and of the one whom you sent forth jesus christ
8810372 serving jehovah is the best way of life nothing else bears comparison knowing jehovah has given me a purpose in life
8810373 i believed in god so i sought comfort from the local priest he told me that god had taken susanne to heaven where she was now an angel not only did the world around me collapse because of her death but i hated god for having taken her
8810374 then one of jehovahs witnesses showed me from the bible that i had no reason to hate god
8810375 once i began to understand what sort of person jehovah really is i drew closer to him
8810376 received the word from paul and silas with the greatest eagerness of mind carefully examining the scriptures daily as to whether these things were so
8810377 i only brought one carburetor with me and its a big one
8810378 and i aint changin a daggone thing to start 40th
8810379 put the air cleaner back on and line it up
8810380 i gave you your lap i didnt tell that cracker to hit the fence
8810381 it oughta be fine i put eight inches of stagger in it
8810382 any time somebody says that they committed a murder we are going to take that seriously
8810383 we have no way of knowing whether or not richard cooey is just blowing smoke and making things up or whether he did in fact did kill somebody else more than 20 years ago
8810384 i find it extremely troubling that a parent would say the things he wrote in those messages
8810385 hes angry and ready for a fight he is innocent we will try this case it is nothing but a false accusation
8810386 after a very difficult 17 months i feel like i have finally been validated
8810387 i am relieved to find that even federal judges are not above the law and that sexual abuse in the workplace is never acceptable no matter the status of the offender
8810388 g enta br der que a b n o vai rolar

8810394 brian j noggle apparently forgot that the proper design for a tin foil beanie calls for the shiny side out
8810395 im weeping openly right now thanks for hurting my feelings pinhead
8810396 what this takes is some real fighters to oppose it on behalf of the communities involved
8810397 i have found no benefit for the people of the 14th district in this proposed merger
8810398 clearly that proposal is well short of the requirement to significantly minimize any negative impacts this sale might bring about
8810399 instead of having an east to west problem youll have a north south east and west problem
8810400 there could be significant railway bottlenecks without some significant financial rebuilding of the rail system im not so sure that you dont answer one problem with this move but put three more on the table in doing so
8810401 this incident could have been an incident that shattered our lives but we were spared
8810402 from the bottom of my heart i just want to thank you all
8810403 just knowing that i saved the girls life was a big enough award
8810404 this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and it feels amazing
8810405 i never thought something like this would happen to me in my first year of life guarding and that id manage to step up to the task to help the family
8810406 but its always refreshing whenever young people are doing extraordinary things
8810407 as a result of the circuit courts abandonment of its policy issuing recognizance bonds the cook county jail will once again become overcrowded
8810408 whatever was going to blow away has already blown away
8810409 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
8810410 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent
8810411 it is simply impossible to determine exactly where and when gustav will make final landfall
8810412 the chances of hurricane force winds within the next five days are essentially the same at each individual location from the florida panhandle coast westward through the entire coastline of louisiana
8810413 some of them were killed when trees fell on their houses
8810414 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8810415 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000
8810416 john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies all over again
8810417 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man
8810418 if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8810419 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve experienced in the history of humankind
8810420 not only in the heat of this election but in the aftermath as we put his agenda to work for our country
8810421 has taught him something that career politicians often overlook that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance
8810422 besides being a powerful tool to assist students in preparing for the phr or sphr certification exams the shrm learning system course also provides professional development for hr professionals and hr departments
8810423 changes in land use instigated by increasing industrialization are a growing concern particularly in my home province of central saskatchewan
8810424 is a man of integrity he is a leader he understands the dynamics of our community and we really do believe he understands the needs of naperville
8810425 and he already has the respect right off the bat from naperville and from the park district as well
8810426 im going to be at the top but certainly ill rely on the leadership team to challenge me on certain things and say that may have worked in law enforcement but here it doesnt work that way and i want that
8810427 i dont want yes men and women and im going to challenge them too
8810428 i think the board felt that was appropriate under the circumstances given the history of its relationships with directors and i think its trying to make sure its a good fit before it commits to a long term relationship
8810429 i certainly hope this is the last director for a really long time because i plan on staying until they push me out the doors
8810430 from experience i realized that theres not a lot of information about the disease only 700 people in the united states get it
8810431 so i thought about what i could do to raise awareness and i came up with this crazy idea to do two triathlons in a week
8810432 people think i am stupid but if someone asks why then i can tell them about aplastic anemia
8810433 it was an eight month ordeal of not knowing if she was going to live
8810434 the hardest of all was not knowing if we could ever have kids
8810435 if someone thought they couldnt do something at the other end its personal growth
8810436 that sits on its hands while a major american city drowns before our eyes
8810437 you say stop it i dont like that in a strong voice
8810438 one is good for a quiet walk two is right for a quiet talk
8810439 i hope schoolboys arent too big for good night kisses
8810440 to ensure that any claims asserted are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument
8810441 it was a case that had no merit was totally frivolous and michael stanard and his attorney knew it
8810442 the way he maligned the men and women of this department it was just bizarre

8810450 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8810451 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time

8810453 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8810454 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8810455 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8810456 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8810457 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8810458 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8810459 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8810460 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8810461 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden

8810465 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
8810466 im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8810467 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8810468 but i dont know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers
8810469 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8810470 what he should not do is what he will be criticized for not doing give a detailed policy speech this is not the place for that
8810471 ive got to get out there and take advantage of all the space
8810472 ill always be a new yorker i just need to get rid of 80 percent of the people here
8810473 what better place to start again than in the garden state
8810474 this election has never been about me its about you
8810475 its a moment in our history that well never forget
8810476 most times people are offering thousands of dollars to get out of politicians speeches
8810477 it isnt that john mccain doesnt care its that he just doesnt get it
8810478 john mccain says that hell follow ubl to the gates of hell but he wont follow him to his cave
8810479 at some point hes got to tell us how he plans
8810480 civilizations flourish the most where the masses are passionate about their liberties
8810481 this now makes it complete this is an important day for the mission because we do not actually have an idol now
8810482 it just signifies the concepts that we are learning it also inspires devotion and it inspires that love for god whatever that means to each person
8810483 we just enjoy coming here and learning about our vedanta and literature
8810484 the main thing is there is a place we can call our own
8810485 we had no idea the savings would be as significant as they turned out to be
8810486 were trying to do our best to make sure were as ready for winter as we can be
8810487 well have 10 000 tons of salt in our two domes before winter even starts
8810488 everybodys talking about it being over 100 a ton im not so sure
8810489 its about creating the learning environment for children into the future
8810490 more administrative and staff driven this one is a more community driven process
8810491 we wanted to show works that have dialogue but also showing how history runs its course
8810492 from an audience standpoint it will be easier to digest

8810495 audio can be heard of certain sheriffs officers making rather incriminating statements
8810496 it provides an additional assurance that an employer or an insurance company wont be able to use your genetic information against you in making a hiring or firing or coverage decision
8810497 its really important that consumers understand that and that they have peace of mind
8810498 dude what so my dick is flapping in the breeze
8810499 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8810500 a question for you would you rather bucknell make the ncaas once every 20 years or so and get ass raped by teams like kansas in the first round or have them drop down a rung to a confernce where they can compete for a title
8810501 interesting i use a mac to help me design the next cray
8810502 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8810503 the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid
8810504 why else would he define middle class as someone making under 5 million a year
8810505 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy
8810506 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich
8810507 if youre just talking about income how about 5 million
8810508 when john mccain said we could just muddle through in afghanistan i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9 11 and made clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights
8810509 afghanistan is dicey i think there are certain areas of the country particularly along the pakistani border that are clearly not under the control of either pakistan or the afghan government
8810510 i am concerned about it but im not as concerned as i am about iraq today obviously or i would be talking about afghanistan but i believe if president hamid karzai can make the progress that he is making that in the long term we may muddle through it in afghanistan
8810511 and when one of his chief advisers the man who wrote his economic plan was talking about the anxiety americans are feeling he said that we were just suffering from a mental recession and that weve become and i quote a nation of whiners
8810512 phil gramm does not speak for me i speak for me
8810513 how else could he offer a plan that would privatize social security and gamble your retirement
8810514 you wont have to ask about it when that character dies well all know
8810515 i dont think you can ever feel safe to quote sarah
8810516 sarah has taken a kind of back seat in terms of being proactive
8810517 my feeling is that theres a slow madness happening in her because she feels that everyones gone out of reach for her were going to see a lot more of john taking control and taking steps towards becoming the man he has to be
8810518 now that he knows for sure that they exist hes sort of determined to figure out why hes a part of this arrangement i think that cromarties garret dillahunt particular suggestions to him and the fact that hes been left alive indicates that he may have a larger part in the plan

8810523 not in huge detail just a couple of sentences per chapter but from start to finish when i got back i wrote the first draft in 10 days thats about 5 000 words a day which is fast the big advantage of which being that i was truly inside the story for that period living it and deaf and blind to the outside world i wish it always worked like that
8810524 its evident from the start that mark and david arent getting on well and it also begins to become clear that marks mother is unwell and getting worse
8810525 one afternoon after an argument with david mark runs into an old lady who lives in the self contained apartment in the basement of the building and she shows him the remains of the old servants quarters from there the book charts two parallel stories marks relationship to david as his mother gets more and more sick and marks excursions into the realm of the servants where increasingly spooky and otherworldly things seem to be happening until it becomes evident why the two stories have a bearing on each other and mark has to step up and do some unusual things for the sake of someone he loves

8810540 i watched her all week she was being tortured every day
8810541 i told her she gave me my son back it was something i needed to say
8810542 i think you dont know what goes on in combat until you are in combat
8810543 i dont think they are going to put on a case in the future with a lack of evidence
8810544 after all this they are still my brothers i wish them the best
8810545 i still believe this case should have went before a military court for the simple fact that military jurors have an easier time understanding what happens in combat
8810546 mit dem faschingschor s quintett sind wir jahrelang vor tausenden zuschauern aufgetreten dabei wurde

8810561 people want to know if there will be a carnival and i tell them no
8810562 this is an old fashioned celebration which will really focus on our history and the picnic is a true picnic there wont be any food for sale so bring a picnic basket
8810563 i think the celebration will say that were proud of our past and the blue collar workers who founded batavia and filled it with a lot of community spirit
8810564 marilyn robinson wrote it for the 150th celebration and it was never performed
8810565 she has been a great historian for batavia the pageant really puts batavias history into perspective
8810566 the celebration as well as the service gives us a chance to stop and think about the ideals and values that the people who settled this community brought with them
8810567 they were dedicated not only to literally building homes for themselves but to creating a community institution
8810568 i will tell the people at the worship service that the first public building in batavia was a school it wasnt a tavern or a church it was later used for civic gatherings and for church services but it was built as a school in 1834 just one year after christopher payne settled here it indicates that there was a concern for the common good
8810569 it is a reminder to all of us that we are part of a community that reaches not only laterally from neighbor to neighbor but historically from generation to generation
8810570 as a member of the citys leadership team its humbling to think that we are stewards of a community that has existed for so long but we are also reminded that the implications of what we do today will have an impact far into the future
8810571 there are a lot of white voters out there some of them union members who think that hes the wrong race

8810574 i think hes finally going to leave the creek after this season
8810575 really all i love to do is make pacey jokes
8810576 it was something i have been hesitant about for the last five years since dawsons creek ended
8810577 and you know the time commitment and the being in one place of it all is a massive life shift and i had a really great five years of not being on tv but i dont know the stars sort of aligned for this and j j s a great guy
8810578 beyond the lifestyle choices of working on a television show the thing that had kept me from doing tv was knowing how hard it is to tell good shows good stories over a long period of time and he and his group he works with the same people over and over again have a track record of being able to do that and that was the thing that sort of tipped it to the other side for me
8810579 well were all here and were in it and were doing it together and we take our jobs just seriously enough that everybody shows up ready to work but not so seriously that its you know the end of the world if something goes wrong

8810589 i do think however that by agreeing to work on behalf of their subject they risk compromising the inherent independence that wine bloggers possess
8810590 heres the give to get and this is my suggested execution path not rockaways in agreement for receipt of the sample you agree to write a blog post on or around the week of august 18th you do not have to write anything favorable but you do have to write a post with a word count between 300 500 words you can choose to write a review on the wine or if you choose not to review it you can write around any number of story angles about the wine winery concept etc i would encourage you as i will do to be fully transparent about the sampling in fact i plan doing a lead up with a post or two about my interactions with robert and the fact that wineries are starting to get wine blogging take wine bloggers seriously and to engage us with a level of rapport usually reserved for only established media
8810591 i have committed to robert larson of rodney strong vineyards that we would post in between next monday august 18th and thursday the 21st 300 words is the requested minimum the notion here is to do something thoughtful and meaningful there is no editorial restriction but id like the piece in whatever form you decide to take it to be something you are proud to stand behind
8810592 i think its time for all that participated in this craziness to sit back relax and reflect on what we could have done differently and better to further our collective cause for each other and all consumers of wine i for one would like to see those that have left the fold to reconsider and rejoin our collective effort we need them
8810593 democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard

8810595 scea has released another little batch of screenshots from killzone 2s multiplayer mode
8810596 theres nothing really new to report on senator mccains decision i think well all hear from him shortly and hopefully well be able to move forward together
8810597 basically thats what some council members are saying we want to have some serious and straightforward discussions on what will be getting us through the rest of the year
8810598 we need to face the wolf hes not at the door hes sitting in the living room and hes in daddys chair
8810599 if we go into state receivership theyll make the cuts and we dont want to see that happen
8810600 at some point well be looking at the hard subject of layoffs
8810601 i want no layoffs for police departments and fire personnel period
8810602 barack obama accepted the democratic nomination thursday night with a lofty vision for the nations future that is far easier to articulate than to accomplish
8810603 obamas speech ended just shy of 11 p m et babingtons attack piece was posted at aug 28 11 26 pm edt the piece is 603 words so we are to believe that babington watched the speech gave it due consideration wrote it turned it in went through editing when through copyediting was then posted online all in 26 minutes
8810604 you guys see the panelists on msnbc look at buchanan as though hes crazy yup hes praising obamas speech called it the best convention speech ever
8810605 obamas speech was more substance than style more specifics than rhetorical flourish
8810606 dont expect anything here to upset the democrats apple cart this is about winning not about speaking truth to power
8810607 interesting i use a mac to help me design the next cray

8810609 we dont really know why the bottle failed and thats the key question for the investigation
8810610 sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurized contents
8810611 the preliminary report was a factual account of the incident and investigation to date
8810612 whatever was going to blow away has already blown away
8810613 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon

8810616 the chances of hurricane force winds within the next five days are essentially the same at each individual location from the westward through the entire coastline of louisiana
8810617 i am looking forward to finally getting a chance at being home
8810618 when its not funny but its supposed to be well be the guys laughing and supporting you
8810619 its kind of hard to take everything and to understand the experience that ive had
8810620 hopefully as time goes on ill be able to sit down and really think about the opportunities ive had
8810621 i thought i ran out of time i messed up
8810622 but i was able to stay positive keep my goals in mind and push through to be in the best shape of my life and swim some of the fastest times in the olympics
8810623 ive spoken to ian and i dont buy that comment
8810624 ive heard nothing from nick i have not been given any indication which direction hes going with his picks i have no clue what hes doing to do
8810625 its a difficult situation because if he was playing gleneagles this week he would basically give up his chance of winning the fedex cup
8810626 this year were basically trying to recreate floodfest because we got flooded out last year
8810627 most everybody scheduled for last year wanted to come back we always have a good mix of folks and of styles
8810628 earnest hemingway once wrote the world is a fine place and worth fighting for i agree with the 2nd part
8810629 those corpses are nice but a bit large to stick in the toilet
8810630 im just saying when you buy stuffs at least know what the stuffs can do
8810631 i think i know where the count is i have a friend who i think is the count
8810632 if they are just carrying a few palestinians that is not a problem
8810633 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8810634 america our work will not be easy the challenges we face require tough choices and democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the worn out ideas and politics of the past
8810635 you think about everything from campaign finance to immigration and on and theres john mccain working across party lines senator obama doesnt have a record now he can make the claim and he can hold himself up as pure and trying to reach to a new generation of post partisan politics but he has to do so largely based on rhetoric and wishful thinking because he doesnt have the record
8810636 there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically
8810637 obama might have a similar bottom line core principles for which in some sense he is willing to die if so we dont know what they are nothing so far in his life approaches mccains decision to refuse repatriation as a pow so as to deny his jailors a propaganda coup in fact there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically thats why his reversal on campaign financing and his transparently false justification of it matter more than similar acts by mccain
8810638 hes pretty much a conventional liberal on the issues and has few examples of breaking with his own party so how does obama try to pull off being post partisan
8810639 his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
8810640 boren the lone democrat in oklahomas congressional delegate said that while obama has talked about working with republicans unfortunately his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
8810641 the record shows obama to be a fairly doctrinaire liberal democrat
8810642 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8810643 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8810644 for a couple of days theyve been saying you voted to raise taxes something like 94 times that seems to be the drumbeat thats going to happen during this campaign are you going to raise taxes in a big way for average americans
8810645 i mean this is the standard fare of politics and the truth of the matter is that the only bills that i voted for for the most part since ive been in the senate were introduced by republicans with george bush you know they were the majority for a big chunk of the time i was there
8810646 finally the obama people are too convinced that they can define mccain as bush iii the case is just factually inaccurate mccain will be able to pull out dozens of instances from torture to global warming to spending in which he broke with his party as rush limbaugh will tell you
8810647 as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq
8810648 in early november 2003 at a time when fred dalton thompson was playing a tough d a on law and order john mccain was cross examining donald rumsfeld for real on capitol hill it was still very early into the u s occupation of iraq but the as yet unacknowledged by rummy that is insurgency was already out of control alone among his fellow gop senators mccain blasted rumsfeld for not putting enough u s troops on the ground and for resorting too soon to iraqification that is transferring security to ill prepared iraqi forces in an extraordinarily blunt speech at the council on foreign relations that grim autumn mccain warned that ultimately iraq could become another vietnam if we lose popular support in the united states the next day the secretary of defense asked mccain to breakfast i read y our speech harrumphed rumsfeld that must have been an enjoyable experience for him mccain later joked to me then rummy patiently explained to his fellow republican why he and his top civilian brass paul wolfowitz doug feith and the usual crowd of incompetents would continue to do things the same way they believed there was no need for additional troops mccain later related mccain had already realized that rumsfeld was a lost cause the real question the senator suggested to me back then was whether george w bush himself would push rummy to make changes id like to see the president fully engaged mccain said bush needed to be on top of more details of whats going on as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq right down to the need for bush to get engaged and fire rumsfeld mccain was so right that among military experts today the emerging conventional wisdom about bushs current surg e is that if it had occurred back then when mccain wanted it and the political will existed in this country to support it for the necessary number of years it might well have succeeded
8810649 widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush
8810650 on global warming mccain is widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush immediately after the 2004 election in which he stumped for bushs re election he sharply distanced himself from bush on climate change calling the administrations stance terribly disappointing mccain had co sponsored a bill with sen joe lieberman to curb greenhouse gases in 2003 bush had opposed any such move citing possible harm to the economy and doubts over global warming
8810651 he said that our economy has made great progress under this president he said that the fundamentals of the e conomy are strong
8810652 the second and third quotes the obama campaign uses from mccain are more misleading the ad shows mccain saying t heres been great progress economically the quote comes from an interview mccain did with peter cook at bloomberg television in april mccain was making a case for what he believed were positive economic developments during bushs time in office however the fuller quote shows mccain was saying that whatever progress had been made it wouldnt be enough to comfort families facing these tremendous economic challenges his comments overall are pessimistic he cites challenging times and enormous difficulties the obama campaign distorts his views by using just a snippet of his remarks
8810653 im going to ask you a version of the ronald reagan question you think if americans were asked are you better off today than you were before george bush took office more than seven years ago what answer would they give
8810654 certainly in this time we are in very challenging times
8810655 i think if you look at the overall record and millions of jobs have been created et cetera et cetera yo u could make an argument that theres been great progress economically over that period of time but thats no comfort thats no comfort to families now that are facing these tremendous economic challenges but let me just add peter the fundamentals of americas economy are strong were the greatest exporter the greatest importer the greatest innovator the greatest producer still the greatest economic engine in the world and by the way exports and free trade are a key element in economic recovery but these are tough times tough times and nobody knows that more than american families including in small towns of pennsylvania they havent lost their fundamental religious beliefs their respect for the constitution their right to bear arms they are still keep america as a beacon of hope and freedom throughout the world
8810656 he knows how to twist with the best of them
8810657 although obama gets substantial mileage out of running against politics as usual he provided a reminder on friday that he knows how to twist with the best of them
8810658 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow but i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet twenty first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy
8810659 i do not make a promise that we can reduce the budget deficit by 2013
8810660 i do not make a promise that we can reduce it by 2013 because i think it is important for us to make some critical investments right now in americas families obama told reporters this week when asked if hed match mccains pledge
8810661 since winning the nomination obama reportedly has been moving toward the middle of the political spectrum but on the budget he still sounds left of center with no interest in eliminating deficit spending
8810662 frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years
8810663 barack obama says john mccains plan to balance the budget doesnt add up easy for him to say its not a goal hes even trying to reach not only does obama say he wont eliminate the deficit in his first term as mccain aims to do he frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years considering his own spending plans
8810664 obama has rhetorically committed to a pay as you go approach by offsetting new spending and tax cuts with new taxes or spending cuts but his proposals do not come close to meeting this standard
8810665 has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of
8810666 the obama campaign responds that tax cuts once enacted are usually renewed and do not expire therefore they say obama can legitimately claim to be recouping money for other purposes by scaling back the tax cuts obama has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of what he wants to do
8810667 both obama and clinton promised to not raise taxes on those making less than 200 000 or 250 000 a year they both just emasculated their domestic programs returning the rich to their clinton era tax rates will yield at best 40 billion a year in revenue its impossible to fund a health care plan let alone anything else with that kind of money the consequences are clear if elected they will have to break their pledge and thus destroy their credibility or run a minimalist administration
8810668 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8810669 the latest additions to sen barack obamas energy plan outlined during an appearance in lansing monday may win the democratic presidential candidate some votes from disgruntled consumers in november but theyll do nothing to answer the nations long term needs
8810670 when his presumptive republican opponent sen john mccain r ariz proposed a gas tax holiday as a way to reduce the high cost of driving mr obama showed political courage and intellectual honesty by refusing to sign on to that obvious gimmick its an idea to get them through an election mr obama said now he has two such gimmicks of his own
8810671 the politics may have changed but the facts havent the accuracy of sen mccains original position has not changed offshore drilling would not lower gas prices today it would not lower gas prices next year and it would not lower gas prices five years from now
8810672 i think john mccains proposal for a three month tax holiday is a bad idea
8810673 in this campaign john mccain is offering the same old gimmicks that will provide almost no short term relief to folks who are struggling with high gas prices gimmicks that will only increase our addiction for another four years
8810674 that might make sense in washington but it doesnt make sense for america in fact it makes about as much sense as his proposal to build 45 new nuclear reactors without a plan to store the waste some place other than guess where right here in nevada at yucca mountain
8810675 democratic presidential candidate barack obamas proposal for a windfall profits tax on oil companies could cost 15 billion a year at last years profit levels a campaign adviser said
8810676 obama may levy 15 billion tax on oil company profit
8810677 but to add a five year tax increase on top of that to pay for a one year gift to voters would indeed increase the cost of doing business that cost would be passed along in forgone investment in new production lower dividends for pension funds and other shareholders and higher prices at the pump thus socking it to the consumers whom the plan is supposed to help if oil prices fall there might be no windfall profits to tax then the obama rebate would have to be paid for through spending cuts taxes on something else or borrowing
8810678 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families
8810679 what obama voted for was a budget resolution that would have allowed most of the provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to expire in particular the resolution would allow the 25 percent tax bracket to return to its pre 2001 level of 28 percent that bracket kicks in at 32 550 for an individual or 65 100 for a married couple but as those of you who have filled out a 1040 know thats not actually how income taxes work we dont pay taxes on our total earnings we pay them based on our taxable income the urban brookings tax policy centers eric toder told factcheck org that people with taxable income of 32 000 would have a total income greater than that in 2008 anyone filing taxes with single status would be entitled to a standar d deduction of 5 450 as well as a personal exemption of 3 500 so to have a taxable income high enough to reach the 25 percent bracket an individual would need to earn at least 41 500 in total income while a married couple would need a combined income of at least 83 000
8810680 certainly obamas votes indicate a willingness to raise taxes and obama has not been shy about saying explicitly that he will raise some taxes
8810681 campaign aides to senator obama today called the charge that he voted for tax hikes on people making only 32 000 a year quote bogus they circulated an analysis stating that the resolution that obama had voted for would not have increase taxes on single taxpayer making less than 41 500 a year in total income
8810682 vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year
8810683 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back

8810711 america we are a better than these last eight years
8810712 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8810713 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight
8810714 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8810715 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8810716 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8810717 you dont defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying iraq you dont protect israel and deter iran by talking tough in washington
8810718 if john mccain wants to follow george bush with more tough talk and bad strategy that is his choice but its not the change we need
8810719 people of every creed and colour from every walk of life
8810720 is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8810721 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8810722 the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8810723 i get it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
8810724 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8810725 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8810726 this election has never been about me its about you
8810727 its a moment in our history that well never forget
8810728 most times people are offering thousands of dollars to get out of politicians speeches
8810729 new zealanders believe they are living in the most perfect place on the face of the earth

8810738 to chairman dean and my great friend dick durbin and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
8810739 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8810740 i get it i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8810741 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8810742 the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 per cent of the time
8810743 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know why else would he define middle class as someone making under five million dollars a year
8810744 how else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million americans
8810745 how else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax peoples benefits or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college or a plan that would privatise social security and gamble your retirement
8810746 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8810747 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8810748 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8810749 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 per cent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8810750 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8810751 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power
8810752 and ill invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8810753 ill invest in early childhood education ill recruit an army of new teachers and pay them higher salaries and give them more support and in exchange ill ask for higher standards and more accountability
8810754 now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable accessible health care for every single american if you have health care my plan will lower your premiums if you dont youll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of congress give themselves
8810755 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8810756 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8810757 dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are here to restore that legacy
8810758 while senator mccain was turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 i stood up and opposed this war knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face
8810759 when john mccain said we could just muddle through in afghanistan i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9 11 and made clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights
8810760 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8810761 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan
8810762 you dont defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying iraq you dont protect israel and deter iran just by talking tough in washington you cant truly stand up for georgia when youve strained our oldest alliances
8810763 the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping ak 47s out of the hands of criminals
8810764 passions fly on immigration but i dont know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers this too is part of americas promise the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort
8810765 wyce is at an important point in its growth and evolution and these two new positions will help us better serve our listeners community members donors and volunteers

8810767 create a cultural outlet akin to a smithsonian institute that you can dance to
8810768 as the community relations coordinator at wyce i look forward to helping keep wyce as the best little radio station on the planet and getting to know more of the wonderful people in grand rapids and beyond
8810769 freedom is the default position everything the government does takes away some of our freedom thats why we have a constitution to restrain the government
8810770 a political party is entitled to have the names of its nominees for president and vice president placed on the ballot if before 5 p m of the 70th day before presidential election day the partys state chair signs and delivers to the secretary of state a written certification of the names of the partys nominees for president and vice president
8810771 this follows every other technology that turns out to have information of forensic value i think what were seeing is evolutionary
8810772 what were dealing with here is a use of the technology that i dont think the good people at magellan or garmin or tomtom really thought about when they were developing it

8810780 its too early to speculate on the nationality of the airman or the circumstances of his death there were allied australian and american and japanese airmen who would have been flying over the area in the war

8810831 this would never have gotten the attention it go if not for the timing
8810832 it could have been anything i cant make any suggestions as to what it was all i can say is we didnt want to take any chances
8810833 we havent got any information back on the one person that was symptomatic yet but looking at the pattern of the illness the length and type of symptoms the people had and the age none of that supports that this is listeriosis

8810849 if organization and effort is any indication democratic presidential nominee barack obama could win more of the rural vote than many of his recent predecessors
8810850 reassure voters who have doubts about his experience and abilities address the poor economy and the anger and frustration of those left behind and address the significant concerns that voters have about his positions on national security and his patriotism
8810851 the real question is why barack obama is not up 10 to 20 points in farm country
8810852 john mccain has given farmers and ranchers absolutely no reason to vote for him

8810866 never trust a computer you cant throw out a window
8810867 humans frequently invoke an argument that their intuition can result in a better decision than conscious reasoning such assertions may rely on subconscious associative learning
8810868 even without conscious processing of contextual cues our brain can learn their reward value and use them to provide a bias on decision making
8810869 we think its fantastic to have such an iconic olympian be part of our bid and be here to support it

8810871 wine lovers wont just sip but guzzle a lot of this down
8810872 bottle shock is more than the story it is also about people who love their work care about it with passion and talk about it with knowledge
8810873 a good nose but not too much in the mouth
8810874 to be funny in a read through is really hard and those women were great
8810875 there was a point where julia squeezed my knee under the table because she was getting laughs big laughs you could see she was having a blast
8810876 people would say just let go itll never get made when i heard the words cant be done it became a mission i think thats what it takes for some of these films just one idiot who sticks with it for the whole duration refusing to back down
8810877 i keep telling women you cant complain that theres nothing to see
8810878 i would go from studio to studio with my list of female ensemble movies that have made a ton of money like 9 to 5 first wives club and steel magnolias
8810879 and always the response was well that was a fluke
8810880 and because the original had a lot of old fashioned ideas about womens place in society i thought okay theres a reason to remake it
8810881 it was intimidating but i thought this is the only way to get this made
8810882 i would go from studio to studio with my list of female ensemble movies that have made a ton of money like 9 to 5 first wives club and steel magnolias
8810883 and always the response was well that was a fluke and no it doesnt pencil out for us the feeling was because it will attract one quadrant women over 25 that wasnt enough
8810884 but i liked that the retelling of the story was different
8810885 the unique idea of not having any men in the film was a great publicity hook
8810886 theres always a risk involved with movies like this like diane hadnt done a feature before but hopefully it was a smart business move
8810887 obviously ours is an older audience compared to sex and the city but even if the women does a small percentage of what they did its great
8810888 every now and then both annette and i would sort of interpret movie jargon for diane
8810889 im not privy to all the conversations that took place
8810890 but i dont think it was their cup of tea
8810891 obviously ours is an older audience compared to sex and the city
8810892 but even if the women does a small percentage of what they did its great id love it if we did 9 or 10 million opening weekend
8810893 i dont know what im going to do with this big chunk of time now
8810894 it might be as tough to get made as the women
8810895 im not sure young boys came to prada but that didnt hurt our box office one iota
8810896 because older women are discounted and disregarded by the studios
8810897 i think a lot of people would look at those movies and say thats a lifetime movie
8810898 that used to be really good theatrical territory and its been preempted by cable
8810899 most men probably arent going to sit down and write for a woman
8810900 i dont know why they arent making more movies for women except they dont have the screenplays
8810901 after the devil wears prada opened i got calls from other studios and several high powered male agents
8810902 they all said the same thing i just think this is great for business

8810913 the speech was eloquent but no matter how nice his rhetoric it does not change his paper thin record
8810914 the fact is he is against increased drilling against an all of above energy plan and voted for tax increases on people making as little as 42 000

8810917 im very impressed its good to have a kit to celebrate the 40th anniversary of that amazing night obviously that was a great night for the club and there is a massive history behind the game and the players who played that night its great that we can commemorate that history with this kit for it to look so good and be the same colour as the kit from back then is a testimony to the designers and i think the lads will like it
8810918 we look to the grit and determination of those who came before us
8810919 we know by their example that theres no problem we cant solve if we stick together
8810920 in the spirit of the west we can move forward putting our partisan differences behind us and putting the best interests of america first
8810921 here at the foot of the great rocky mountains we have found leaders to match our mountains
8810922 in the same bold pragmatic spirit that defines the west we will move forward
8810923 every generation has had to change this country to make it work and we democrats have always led that charge

8810928 a citizen sees the beating in a parking lot police get there fast they see him beating her its a good solid case
8810929 he was on top of her actually in the act of violently beating her when the officers arrived with the knife in his hand

8810932 i shouldnt be wearing white and you cant afford no ring
8810933 reached across party lines to keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists
8810934 the two worked together for barely a week after which mccain accused obama of partisan posturing
8810935 but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8810936 that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
8810937 to own their failure its time for us to change america and thats why im running for president of the united states
8810938 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8810939 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8810940 if john mccain wants to follow george bush with more tough talk and bad strategy that is his choice but it is not the change that america needs
8810941 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8810942 why else would he define middle class as someone making under 5 million a year
8810943 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy
8810944 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich
8810945 if youre just talking about income how about 5 million
8810946 when john mccain said we could just muddle through in afghanistan i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9 11 and made clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights
8810947 afghanistan is dicey i think there are certain areas of the country particularly along the pakistani border that are clearly not under the control of either pakistan or the afghan government
8810948 i am concerned about it but im not as concerned as i am about iraq today obviously or i would be talking about afghanistan but i believe if president hamid karzai can make the progress that he is making that in the long term we may muddle through it in afghanistan
8810949 and when one of his chief advisers the man who wrote his economic plan was talking about the anxiety americans are feeling he said that we were just suffering from a mental recession and that weve become and i quote a nation of whiners
8810950 phil gramm does not speak for me i speak for me
8810951 how else could he offer a plan that would privatize social security and gamble your retirement
8810952 why else would he define middle class as someone making under 5 million a year
8810953 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy
8810954 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich
8810955 if youre just talking about income how about 5 million
8810956 when john mccain said we could just muddle through in afghanistan i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9 11 and made clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights
8810957 afghanistan is dicey i think there are certain areas of the country particularly along the pakistani border that are clearly not under the control of either pakistan or the afghan government
8810958 i am concerned about it but im not as concerned as i am about iraq today obviously or i would be talking about afghanistan but i believe if president hamid karzai can make the progress that he is making that in the long term we may muddle through it in afghanistan
8810959 and when one of his chief advisers the man who wrote his economic plan was talking about the anxiety americans are feeling he said that we were just suffering from a mental recession and that weve become and i quote a nation of whiners
8810960 phil gramm does not speak for me i speak for me
8810961 how else could he offer a plan that would privatize social security and gamble your retirement
8810962 based on our discussions it was determined that it would probably be in dr paxtons best interest and the colleges best interest that he resign as president
8810963 there are regions affected by the storm that our teams have not been able to reach
8810964 the majority of victims died when their houses collapsed or were killed by falling trees others drowned when they tried to cross swollen rivers
8810965 i talked to her and she nodded over and over and over again she wanted to leave
8810966 no athlete would like to have a life with only their eyes talking
8810967 i find it extremely troubling that a parent would say the things he wrote in those messages
8810968 im going for maximum death and destruction in the work place
8810969 theyll go play for some aau team in the summer and theyll like the other kids and theyll like the other coach
8810970 then all of a sudden they decide lets just go to the same school sally goes to it makes our job a little more difficult
8810971 theres such a strong collegial relationship with superintendents of school corporations that i dont think that will take place
8810972 we dont want to get into a stealing students kind of mode
8810973 i know ips is trying really hard to make a lot of changes
8810974 but the people who end up getting left behind are the students who achieve really well
8810975 what will happen is only students with families that can provide transportation which is huge will be even able to take advantage of that
8810976 we want to make sure that we dont overextend ourselves
8810977 the 140 number is easy for us to manage weve done it for years if its much more well have to go to plan b
8810978 i feel like i just hit the lottery and didnt have to buy a ticket
8810979 its all about opportunity and being able to choose and pick the best choice i honestly look at it as what a phenomenal opportunity for those who may not have the financial capability to pay private tuition
8810980 the more important concept is parents have a choice and then they have a greater commitment to that whole exercise because theyve made a choice
8810981 it would be so good for the public schools and the parents and the kids its the right thing to do
8810982 kim i must graduate by 2012 because i must be in the african parliament
8810983 aii you cannot be sick today the villages hand is in your hands you cannot go against your people you have to do it
8810984 do you know what that would mean the ancestors would not forgive us you cannot sacrifice the whole village for your own sake you should have known better and not gone to the granary at night
8810985 last time team officials called me up and said were going out to oakland for a week
8810986 so i pack up some clothes and get out to oakland and look on tv and every thing i own is under water
8810987 weve all had time to put together a clear plan as to how it affects the organization the team the families of the team
8810988 i dont want to go into detail as to what we do because what we do is really predicated on when its supposed to arrive
8810989 we will be focused and ready to play the buccaneers
8810990 were planning on that game being at the superdome but the powers that be will have a clear plan in place if that should change any or if our preparation should have to be somewhere else it wont be a distraction we wont allow it to be
8810991 when provoking a war of aggression we will hit back beginning with the us
8810992 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8810993 why else would he define middle class as someone making under 5 million a year
8810994 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy
8810995 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich

8810998 afghanistan is dicey i think there are certain areas of the country particularly along the pakistani border that are clearly not under the control of either pakistan or the afghan government
8810999 i am concerned about it but im not as concerned as i am about iraq today obviously or i would be talking about afghanistan but i believe if president hamid karzai can make the progress that he is making that in the long term we may muddle through it in afghanistan
8811000 and when one of his chief advisers the man who wrote his economic plan was talking about the anxiety americans are feeling he said that we were just suffering from a mental recession and that weve become and i quote a nation of whiners
8811001 phil gramm does not speak for me i speak for me
8811002 how else could he offer a plan that would privatize social security and gamble your retirement
8811003 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8811004 id like to ask you to stop put your paper down for two minutes and try the root pose
8811005 our minds are wired to think and spin what we worry about doesnt happen
8811006 we can begin to stop them and the behaviors that result
8811007 acting in ways you regret later saying things you dont mean
8811008 its now become a part of me im taking time out to take care of me i focus better
8811009 i stare out my kitchen window at the flowers and birds where i might not have paid attention before
8811010 these bring you into the present moment increase awareness of thought patterns if you can be here for the moment relax be clear you can be more effective
8811011 you dont have to be caught in a spiral of anxiety you can have control over anxiety
8811012 im capable of adjusting my attitude accepting life including the ups and downs and number one is stop judging myself
8811013 there is anxiety in the markets right now and anytime there is anxiety the prices goes up
8811014 this has the potential to be a very devastating major storm for the gulf states
8811015 theyre still in the recovery phase from hurricane katrina so to be hit with a significant storm three years later is a pretty significant deal
8811016 there was once music in our lives but i can feel it slipping away men are tramping the dusty roads asking for work a sandwich a cup of tea my father is bitter and my mother is sad i have no brothers no sisters no after school friends the days are long no one has time for music
8811017 guys you know the place has defaulted every 10 years since the 1930s so what makes you think it will be different this time around make them prove it
8811018 while the deal will boost capital supporting the remaining fgic policy holders it does little to solve the companys longer term solvency issues
8811019 the business environment is rapidly becoming more difficult things remain very uncertain not just in the united states but in emerging countries and resource rich nations as well
8811020 check out the chart above the suckers rally started on july 15th and back then
8811021 with this partnership we greatly extend the consumer value of our oem technology platforms evo1 and evo2 under this agreement our oem customers can now chose to integrate premium video demand services from one of the international leaders in the vod content business when they use our platform for their own connected tv or set top box products

8811023 with winboxs innovative solutions we can extend the premium online experience to the tv further delivering on the cinemanow mission to empower consumers to enjoy digital entertainment anytime and anywhere
8811024 america is ready for change but john mccain has only changed his mind on taxes on immigration on global warming even on torture
8811025 john mccain may pay hundreds of dollars for his shoes but were the ones who pay for his flip flops
8811026 not where we think they are but where they are like in russia
8811027 his economic advisers say americans families are whiners but when the oil companies whine john mccain says they need more tax breaks
8811028 finally we need a president who in his first day in office says this i will follow and uphold the constitution of the united states and then actually does it
8811029 in italy theyre happy with the result but here in bedum we are much more happy because the tower of pisa is now leaning less than the tower of bedum

8811034 we are very pleased that our joint venture companies with our mexican partners have now been granted these very important environmental permits as this validates the extensive work and effort expended by mgn the permits give us a clear advantage to bring these projects to the yucatan peninsula which is forecasted to be one of the fastest growing regions in mexico as the pipeline and lng projects continue to develop we expect the incremental value of our interest to increase thus being accretive to our investment we also continue to evaluate possible oil and gas exploration opportunities in the us and abroad in an effort to position the company in both active drilling programs and high impact opportunities
8811035 we need to turn the page and put the kids at the head of the class
8811036 barack obama will invest 10 billion in early education funding and give any student who wants to go to college a 4 000 tax credit
8811037 bangladesh oil and gas markets investment opportunities analysis and forecasts to 2020
8811038 luxury isnt getting a ton better but it is hanging in there people are going to remain concerned about what happens next given the state of the global economy and the global equity markets
8811039 the good news is that the sector is still outperforming others over the next two years
8811040 its just a matter of getting through the storm by focusing on the right markets the right suppliers and the right categories weve got to run a tighter smarter business
8811041 the biggest mistake luxury brands make is in not sticking with their core value system and core customer
8811042 i dont think you could say that by staying true a brand is guaranteed success however if they dont stay true success will be much more difficult to come by
8811043 hermes sells the absolutely classic birkin bags but also bring out new styles of merchandise from watches to branded cars that show they know how to continue to interpret and apply their core values
8811044 we were also extremely solid in developing countries like china asia as a whole south america and the middle east

8811049 we have serious grounds to think that there were u s citizens right in the combat zone
8811050 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
8811051 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8811052 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8811053 it seems like an easy solution in reality it turns out that its not always so
8811054 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
8811055 it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8811056 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8811057 we try and keep our industry out of politics and into marketing opportunities but sometimes its very difficult to separate the two
8811058 at this point if russia were to walk back from certain agreements they have made it would clearly delay any future aspirations they have of joining the
8811059 trying to draw up a strong text signifying our unwillingness to accept
8811060 sanctions are being considered and many other means as well
8811061 i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8811062 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring
8811063 of every creed and colour from every walk of life
8811064 our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8811065 though the lord is on high he looks upon the lowly but the proud he knows from afar
8811066 we are extremely pleased with the record results of the 2008 fourth quarter and fiscal year
8811067 as we now enter fiscal year 2009 we believe we have the right people infrastructure and products in place which will allow us to continue to grow our company and expand our customer base
8811068 wounded service members face many challenges in their return to civilian life housing shouldnt be one of them this dinner was a great way for individuals and families in our community to support our program and meet some of the veterans were working with
8811069 we still have a lot of money to raise but weve been pleasantly overwhelmed by the response
8811070 sometimes it is very difficult to not think of what you dont want
8811071 i bet the people who run outdoor programs are well adjusted competent employees who enjoy their work and genuinely like young people unlike professor asshole mctweedy whose ironic detachment from everything genuine would never allow him to enjoy an outdoor activity for its own sake why dont you malcontents stick to bitching about your own miserable lives and quit mocking decency
8811072 it almost seems as if hes growing into the job
8811073 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8811074 the beacons mission is to improve the character of our world by opening the hearts of listeners with radio that is encouraging entertaining and inspiring
8811075 we are looking forward to enjoying your great products and sharing them with our soldiers sailors marines airmen and coastguardsmen worldwide
8811076 the men amp women of our armed forces are willing to protect our freedoms with their very lives we are gratified and very excited that the beacon can reciprocate by taking a few of those freedoms of speech and religion to give back to our troops and their families by providing positive and uplifting programming and giving them spiritual fuel and entertainment to recharge their batteries
8811077 the decision from russia the biggest foreign consumer of u s poultry to ban imports from u s poultry companies and the myriad other meat recalls that have occurred recently in the u s illustrate that the american meat supply is shockingly unsafe prior to russias ban 19 poultry facilities ignored warnings from russian inspectors concerned about excessive levels of antibiotics and arsenic found in their poultry far from the idyllic farms people envision todays poultry factories crowd thousands of chickens and turkeys tightly into filthy warehouses where they are given little space to move made susceptible to disease and fed antibiotics and arsenic to maximize growth and profitability these factory farms treat both animals and consumers with complete disregard the poultry industrys short sighted desire to prioritize profits over human safety and animal welfare has now backfired opening americas factory farms to international scrutiny

8811081 i urge all victims to tell your teachers tell your parents or to contact police
8811082 you dont realise about this country you dont do anything for the country shouted demonstrators singing protest songs as a further 300 police took up positions in nearby rajadoemneon avenue
8811083 they wont allow us to send a new group of police lieutenant general akerach meepreecha of metropolitan police said
8811084 there are regions affected by the storm that our teams have not been able to reach
8811085 the majority of victims died when their houses collapsed or were killed by falling trees others drowned when they tried to cross swollen rivers
8811086 we believe that the 12 executions were an isolated incident and not part of a strategy to destabilise the state guzman told reporters
8811087 the preliminary report was a factual account of the incident and investigation to date
8811088 i knew i need a triple so as soon as i hit the ball im going to go to third
8811089 they were going all crazy and i was just thinking about boone a little bit
8811090 but as soon as he hit the ball everybody was go three go three go three all the way
8811091 i didnt know what was going on until everybody went to screaming
8811092 i was just trying to sit there and get some air or whatever and i look at the board because everybody was screaming in the dugout and i was like oh thats why so i went to screaming too
8811093 you get that two run lead in the first inning its kind of the last thing you want to do is give up runs especially that many
8811094 we have to go out there and win a ball game to start making us feel good right now it doesnt feel too good
8811095 it was just a great feeling in a season full of some not so happy memories
8811096 weve been playing well of late and its just good to see smiles on everyones face
8811097 increase crashes and injuries as drivers attempt to abruptly stop
8811098 im getting on a bit while ive seen people tasered im probably reluctant to do it myself
8811099 if were prepared to use this on members of the public when we have to its only right and proper that the head of the organisation tries it out for himself
8811100 its a very fair result and we appreciate the nfl taking a second look
8811101 brandon was thrilled its as good as we expected or hoped for
8811102 lance corporal marks was killed conducting a combat operation in an extremely demanding environment
8811103 a thorough inquiry was undertaken into his death the inquiry officer looked at equipment training the operational situation and available support on the day of the incident to ascertain if there was anything that could have been done to prevent lance corporal markss death
8811104 ive lived here for 70 years but never experienced anything like this before a man told public broadcaster nhk
8811105 you could call it a guerrilla downpour it just lashed down suddenly
8811106 she had a feeble back and legs and was living alone i guess she had trouble running away a worried neighbour told nhk
8811107 it is showing no signs of recovery mr sebastian said
8811108 certainly investors are staying away from the housing market in droves
8811109 weaker motor vehicle sales less purchases on credit cards and evaporating interest in margin trading have seen consumer credit contract further this month dr joiner said
8811110 the survey showed that capital spending intentions remain solid with firms intending to boost spending 32 per cent in the year ending june 2009 it appears that the business investment cycle is far from over dr joiner said
8811111 we anticipate that credit growth should begin to show signs of improvement in 2009 as interest rates are cut further from mid next year and conditions and sentiment begin to improve
8811112 what a great come from behind win just a great win i mean exciting
8811113 this place really got loud i dont know if it was the loudest ive heard it but let me tell you what it was loud
8811114 i mean ive been able to do that since i was in the minor leagues
8811115 ive always been able to drive in runs its something im proud of and i like to be in that situation late in the game
8811116 fontenot hit a homer and all of a sudden its a two run game and we got the top of our lineup coming soriano got on base and theriot got on base we got a good team
8811117 we shouldnt be going through this this is our time to hold these leads and its our job were not getting it done right now
8811118 yeah to think about how well cole threw the ball and how well our guys put at bats up against dempster its a tough one
8811119 that was a situation where we couldnt get people out actually the last game and most of the last games that weve lost thats kind of how its been
8811120 the history here thats not too impressive of a record
8811121 hopefully we can add on to that a little bit more
8811122 certainly not the way we drew it up the thing thats really painful for me and the staff is you want to give people a reason to believe
8811123 i feel like we let a lot of people down
8811124 i was proud of them it would have been easy to come here and not be ready to play
8811125 i dont know if ive ever been this nervous about an opening game weve always played well as the underdog but i was really concerned about having that top 25 ranking coming in here
8811126 kirbys been through some ups and downs we felt like he deserved the opportunity and we gave it to him
8811127 i thought griffin provided a spark which is what he has to do for us
8811128 i wonder how many of these kids will be my students
8811129 if my daughter ever grew up and married a vegetarian id never forgive her
8811130 greater stability in principal value than that of long term bonds
8811131 especially when i bought in my broker was telling me exactly what is in print
8811132 suggesting a bond fund instead of a cd is not necessarily a bad thing as long as you explain the risks
8811133 its not that you have to tell everything but you should give people a realistic expectation
8811134 it is unreasonable to expect an investor to read all of the pages of a prospectus and fully understand and interpret the disclosures thats why investors look to marketing material
8811135 looking for a way to earn better yields on your long term cash without taking on significantly higher risk
8811136 oh thats a special dell part ring up dell tech support and they will send you one for free
8811137 so what if hes a pouf he kicked ten goals for us last week
8811138 scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead
8811139 credit growth is actually slowing so the rba has actually achieved what it wanted to do by raising rates and slowing domestic demand and slowing the rate of domestic credit mr smirk said
8811140 now is the time to get out on the front foot
8811141 you shouldnt be waiting until its really obvious that inflation has gone all the way back down to where wed like it to be before you can conclude youve got to start doing something before that day
8811142 we think they will cut rates to mitigate the downside risks from that ms deda said
8811143 we dont think they may be as aggressive as past easing cycles
8811144 by the middle of next year it will be clear that inflation is heading down and the reserve bank will have cut interest rates by over 100 basis points mr oughton said
8811145 we think its a blow for academic freedom and for universal access to scholarly work said steven schwartz macquaries vice chancellor
8811146 some dont care some have embargo periods some want you to request permission he said
8811147 any sort of bullying whether it be in the playground or over a computer is not acceptable and we take these matters very seriously
8811148 theyre saying lower it information technology spending is spreading that is evidence of a global slowdown in it spending this certainly isnt good news for tech overall
8811149 dells outlook is for slower spending especially in asia and western europe
8811150 strategic actions to accelerate growth in certain areas of our business affected gross margins this quarter
8811151 its a really tough tech market and dell is obviously cutting costs but it wasnt enough to offset the pressure on gross margin
8811152 sir peter has undertaken a critical body of work and has provided the government with a number of key recommendations on how we can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our application of ict to service delivery
8811153 sir peter has conducted an extensive series of consultations with a range of stakeholders from within government the ict industry and related representative organisations
8811154 he has applied his extensive experience obtained in major strategic reviews in the uk with an evidence based approach and has developed a range of robust and achievable recommendations for the australian government
8811155 with sustained leadership and drive at ministerial and top official levels and by providing the enablers of change with the necessary resources not only in funding terms but also skills of the right calibre the australian government through implementing these recommendations can drive significant improvements in its use of ict
8811156 i am confident that the recommended actions and proposed changes can be successfully implemented over the next two to three years and will deliver substantial benefits to the australian government
8811157 every time he astonishes me on how low he can go
8811158 why today why not tomorrow there wasnt a decision on why today
8811159 the governors actions will put abused and neglected children at greater risk reduce access to medicaid and food stamps and further harm state parks and historic sites
8811160 he wanted to watch it at home with his family its a historic moment
8811161 the cuts have to do with the budget what happened last night doesnt change the fiscal shape that we were in when the budget came in out of balance not sure how you make that connection
8811162 the whole broadband process has become a shambolic tendering fiasco
8811163 its something thats so confusing and causing such concern in the broadband and telecommunications community that were seeing investment frozen
8811164 this is from an outfit that claimed the election of the rudd government would turn australia from a flintstones era into a jetsons era overnight when neither of those claims are true
8811165 were seeing broken promises racked up on broadband and no improvement in service availability
8811166 we have embarked on such a significant national project here involving potentially billions of dollars of public funds
8811167 we will therefore go through the most rigorous comprehensive public tender process to ensure probity is honoured so we can get on with the business of laying out and rolling out this network
8811168 we are committed to a digital revolution in australia we are committed to a digital education revolution in australia
8811169 its the pathway to the future and were confident in the progress weve made
8811170 earlier this year the shadow minister criticised the timeframes as being unrealistic and dangerously truncated for no apparent reason
8811171 now he criticises the government for taking the time to ensure proponents have the information to prepare robust proposals
8811172 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8811173 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8811174 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8811175 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8811176 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8811177 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan
8811178 the obama national headquarters is just down the street from here they obviously have the time to send out these angry emails but they cant walk a few blocks to our studios
8811179 wgn radio is giving right wing hatchet man stanley kurtz a forum to air his baseless fear mongering terrorist smears
8811180 hes currently scheduled to spend a solid two hour block from 9 00 to 11 00 p m pushing lies distortions and manipulations about barack and university of illinois professor william ayers
8811181 guilty as hell free as a bird america is a great country
8811182 i dont regret setting bombs i feel we didnt do enough
8811183 the fact that some mps are still hoping for last minute changes to make the green shift more marketable is just one sign the liberal party may not be firing on all cylinders by the end of next week when prime minister stephen harper is virtually certain to pull the plug on his government
8811184 one insider said the leader has rejected any criticism of the plan insisting
8811185 in my mind its a statement of principles its not a recipe
8811186 i think if we talk to people and tell them this is a statement of principles of intent and during the implementation that theres leeway to discuss with canadians i think thats the logical way to do it
8811187 p s any brave puma out there who can report on the precious speech
8811188 do i still trust boxer enough to vote for her
8811189 i already gave the real stuff to the real potus candidate senator clinton
8811190 you commit to serving your community or our country we will make sure you can afford a college education
8811191 as president i will make time travel possible and monkeys will fly out of my butt
8811192 as president i will make time travel possible and monkeys will fly out of my butt
8811193 never send a boy to do a mans job especially if a woman could have done it better
8811194 263 mzebest i agree fox was showing people that werent even cheering for obama
8811195 oh by the way thanks to hillary and bill and edward kennedy
8811196 i said if i wanted to watch a thug try to steal an election id move to venezuela
8811197 a generic dem speech was a very straight speech not soaring but it worked
8811198 enough of them appreciated my earnestness and youthful swagger that i made it to the illinois legislature
8811199 the most dramatic examples of mr obamas commitment to old style plitics are his repeated endorsements of chicagos machine politicians which came in opposition to what people of all ideological stripes viewed as the common good mr obama is not the reformer he now claims to be the real man is the one they know in chicago the one who won his first election by depriving the voters of a choice
8811200 p s any brave puma out there who can report on the precious speech
8811201 for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
8811202 now if obama loses she cannot be blamed in any way for it she went above and beyond
8811203 theres no place like home theres no place like home theres no place like home
8811204 senator obama this is truly a good day for america too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations
8811205 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8811206 u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict
8811207 they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8811208 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8811209 for the russians to say they are not responsible for what happened in georgia is ludicrous russia is to blame for this crisis and the world is responding to what russia has done
8811210 this is a red herring wait til it gets fleshed out youll see
8811211 this is a red herring wait til it gets fleshed out youll see

8811224 we are monitoring the situation and working with state and local officials to respond to this storm we are prepared to meet the needs of our community and those who come here seeking assistance
8811225 os defensores da situa o atual est o morrendo de medo da mudan a que barack obama representa
8811226 em 2008 duvido que algu m diga que aquelas elei es n o importaram
8811227 john mccain agora aprova abertamente as pol ticas de bush e o vice presidente dick cheney as mesmas pol ticas
8811228 sou partid rio da reciclagem mas isso j rid culo
8811229 se gostaram das pol ticas de bush ent o mccain o candidato de voc s

8811231 n s estamos aqui porque amamos este pa s demais para permitir que os pr ximos quatro anos se pare am exatamente com os ltimos oito
8811232 em 4 de novembro n s devemos nos levantar e dizer
8811233 agora eu n o acredito que o senador mccain n o se preocupe com as vidas dos americanos eu apenas acho que ele n o as conhece
8811234 o senador mccain gosta de falar sobre julgamento mas s rio o que se pode dizer sobre a sua capacidade de julgamento quando voc acha que george bush estava certo em 90 por cento do tempo
8811235 eu n o sei voc s mas eu n o estou pronto para aceitar 10 por cento de chances de mudan a
8811236 eu tenho not cias para voc john mccain n s colocaremos nosso pa s em primeiro lugar
8811237 sonho com que meus quatro filhos vivam um dia em um pa s onde n o sejam julgados pela cor de sua pele

8811239 os estados unidos est o prontos para a mudan a mas mccain est pronto para mudar de opini o
8811240 ela deve estar focalizada no paquist o e no afeganist o e n o no iraque
8811241 um exemplo de lideran a moral acatando a constitui o fechando guant namo e pondo fim tortura
8811242 v o ter um presidente que prestar aten o am rica latina e ao m xico
8811243 como podemos confiar em um candidato presid ncia que diz se preocupar com a am rica latina mas contra os tratados de livre com rcio com nossos aliados e quer se sentar para conversar incondicionalmente com ditadores como fidel castro e hugo ch vez
8811244 est ce que ma strat gie et mes actions correspondent et permettent de satisfaire lensemble de ces besoins de mes clients
8811245 but this is only one way to use books others are to 1 enumerate the statements 2 to analyse a chapter 3 to divide it into paragraphs under proper headings 4 to tabulate and classify series 5 to trace cause to consequence and consequence to cause 6 to discern character and perceive how character and circumstance interact 7 to get lessons of life and conduct 8 the living knowledge which makes for science out of books all this is possible for school boys and girls and until they have begun to use books for themselves in such ways they can hardly be said to have begun their education
8811246 the teachers part is in the first place to see what is to be done to look over the of the day in advance and see what mental discipline as well as what vital knowledge this and that lesson afford and then to set such questions and such tasks as shall give full scope to his pupils mental activity 1 let marginal notes be freely made as neatly and beautifully as may be for books should be handled with reverence 2 let numbers letters underlining be used to help the eye and to save the needless fag fatigue of writing abstracts 3 let the pupil write for himself half a dozen questions which cover the passage studied he need not write the answers if he be taught that the mind can know nothing but what it can produce in the form of an answer to a question put by the mind to itself
8811247 but let us be careful that our disciplinary devices and our mechanical devices to secure and tabulate the substance of knowledge do not come between the children and that which is the soul of the book the living thought it contains
8811248 i can look at a team that made the super bowl two years ago and won a playoff game in each of the last two years and say they got rid of a running back who is no longer productive shaun alexander and got three who were productive
8811249 i think its premature to say the window is closing i look around at that team and i say ok theres not really an area where i say man they are really weak are there teams that are more talented than seattle in the nfc not many
8811250 we know what green bay did to seattle last year
8811251 that would be the one area to me that would be a concern
8811252 the reality is if its a good game the person at home doesnt really remember who broadcast the game
8811253 i challenge people to tell me who was broadcasting a lot of the olympic events im honestly excited how we were going about it this year with more emphasis on the game
8811254 i am driven by lets go out and do the most complete broadcast we can for the person at home
8811255 and hopefully they enjoy it and like it and learn something about the teams they didnt know thats what drives me people who set out to create a legacy end up falling on their face
8811256 its tough because you are watching it on a screen and they producers are not telling you in your ear what play is going to come up
8811257 you have to be on your ps and qs and thats why it kept me so sharp because even when i was talking i had to look at what was happening and adjust
8811258 signora io non pretendo nulla se non che lei acquisti se vuole una lettera
8811259 metto in vendita lettere damore signora sono scritte bene le pu adoperare le pu inviare se vuole le ho scritte io
8811260 eccomi ho il cappuccino bollente ti ho versato due bustine di zucchero come piace a te bevilo adesso ti scalder
8811261 pensa te ho venduto allistante una lettera oggi sar proprio una bella giornata
8811262 a huge man shapeless of face with large pale eyes with wide sloping shoulders
8811263 a huge man shapeless of face with large pale eyes with wide sloping shoulders
8811264 small and quickwitted dark of face with restless eyes and sharp strong features
8811265 thin young man with a brown face with brown eyes and a head of tightly curled hair
8811266 a guy goes nuts if he aint got nobody dont matter no difference who the guy is longs he with you i tell ya a guy gets too lonely an he gets sick
8811267 cause im black they play cards in there but i cant play because im black they say i stink well i tell you you all stink to me
8811268 i could cook and tend the chickens and hoe the garden some
8811269 youll let me hoe in the garden an ill wash the dishes an little chicken stuff like that
8811270 this is how its done and if you dont like it tough
8811271 what objects should i inherit from activerecord in my situation
8811272 if class a is inherited from ar and contains instance variable binstance of class b which is inherited just from object if i save class a will object binstance be saved too
8811273 classes you want to directly query for the most those which are whole objects and not just some small subpart of another object
8811274 if i was developing a ui for dealing with sdpersonmock
8811275 somehow just using a uuid feels wrong though like using a surrogate pk in a table
8811276 we are currently playing the first ever game of space chess each day greg makes a move and then one of the control centers around the world makes the grounds move we have a video camera setup showing his chess set on the iss and we have one set up in mission control
8811277 retreat you into the soyuz for the entire space walks in case of an emergency
8811278 i have been thinking that i would make a proposition to my republican friends that if they will stop telling lies about the democrats we will stop telling the truth about them
8811279 they are counting on the american labor movement for boots on the ground and mobilization and its nice to be thought of that way
8811280 he has a lot of plans but he has not always articulated them in a passionate enough way
8811281 ive seen that message delivered its in his gut he just needs to be doing it more often
8811282 people will vote against their own economic interests out of fear out of demagoguery out of racism
8811283 what the mccain campaign has deteriorated to is scaring away voters it has created an atmosphere where there is fear and hesitance about senator obama
8811284 this election is about whether voters are comfortable voting for obama
8811285 during my time in congress i have met many wonderful people who work for the federal government out of a sense of service to their country
8811286 unfortunately there is also a sizeable and growing number of federal employees who undermine the agencies they serve by failing to show up to work i believe the american taxpayer deserves better
8811287 the report is little more than a collection of numbers surrounded by innuendoes and loose extrapolations the problem with doing this kind of misrepresentation is that it tells federal employees their work is not valued and their contributions are not recognized making it much harder for agencies to recruit and retain the high quality employees they need
8811288 this isnt about the federal workforce this is about the management of the federal workforce
8811289 our nation needs a change from the approach of bush cheney and mccain
8811290 america we cannot turn back not with so much work to be done not with so many children to educate and so many veterans to care for not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend
8811291 if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from
8811292 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8811293 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
8811294 brought americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington before lincolns memorial and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream
8811295 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8811296 i struggled the first few months it was an uncertain time
8811297 the honest answer is i dont know i have nothing in mind
8811298 i cant recall a time when i had greater happiness
8811299 either i can get on with my life or i could roll the dice i concluded i just really needed to get on with my life
8811300 even during the cold war during the harsh confrontation between the soviet union and the united states we always avoided direct clashes between our civilians even more so between our military personnel
8811301 ordinary experts even if they teach military affairs should not do so in combat zones but in training areas and training centers
8811302 what was the purpose of that gentleman being among the special forces and what is he doing today i so far cannot answer
8811303 i wish we had americans and american weapons but its not the case
8811304 they are living in a parallel world with a parallel perception if you say a lie in russia it becomes the truth the next day on tv
8811305 papers are very important it puts limits on the new prime minister for example the weak point of israeli syrian negotiations are papers signed by former prime ministers that now must be abided during current negotiations
8811306 we were also told not to worry too much about scattered jewish properties in arab neighborhoods or yeshivas jewish seminaries in the old city
8811307 its not like we are wealthy people but theyll kidnap you for a watch everyone is living in fear
8811308 before they only kidnapped key well known economically successful people like industrialists and landowners now they are kidnapping people from the middle class
8811309 i never dreamed i would walk again after i was wounded i forgot what its like
8811310 only when standing up can i feel how tall i really am and speak to people eye to eye not from below
8811311 it raises people out of their wheelchair and lets them stand up straight
8811312 physically the body works differently when upright you can challenge different muscles and allow full expansion of the lungs
8811313 psychologically it lets people live at the upright level and make eye contact
8811314 it may be a burdensome device but it will be very helpful and important for those who choose to use it
8811315 a way for the government to control the population in the future
8811316 identification and tracking of persons using rfid tagged items in store environments
8811317 shopping malls airports train stations bus stations elevators trains airplanes restrooms sports arenas libraries theaters and mu se ums
8811318 rfid tag scanner located in the desired tracking location scans the rfid tags on a person as that person moves around the store different rfid tag scanners located throughout the store can pick up radio signals from the rfid tags carried on that person and the movement of that person is tracked based on these detections the person tracking unit may keep records of different locations where the person has visited as well as the visitation times
8811319 the personal information will be obtained when the person uses his or her credit card bank card shopper card or the like
8811320 what if those machines had a small amount of intelligence and they could assemble themselves into various shapes and were capable of movement or locomotion
8811321 if you had enough of them you could create arbitrary shapes and have the assembly of machines that could take on any form and move in arbitrary ways
8811322 we wanted to monitor the deterioration of the scrolls and realized we needed to take precise photographs to watch the process thats when we decided to do a comprehensive set of photos both in color and infrared to monitor selectively what is happening we realized then that we could make the entire set of pictures available online to everyone meaning that anyone will be able to see the scrolls in the kind of detail that no one has until now
8811323 because of its focus on female empowerment young women are attracted by wicca popularised by the tv series buffy the vampire slayer
8811324 young women tend to express egalitarian values and dislike the traditionalism and hierarchies they imagine are integral to the church
8811325 womens ordination as priests and now bishops has dominated debate and headlines but while looking at women in the pulpit we have taken our eyes off the pews where a shift with more consequences for the churchs survival is underway
8811326 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
8811327 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
8811328 only study bible that presents the text of the new king james version in chronological order
8811329 we understand more deeply what scholars and historians know of the earliest peoples
8811330 it bothers me when bad historical criticism trumps narrative structure
8811331 its primarily a set of theological texts that have historical significance not a set of historical texts that have theological significance
8811332 removes the significance of the authorship through that process of transmission
8811333 i do think you do lose something when you start demolishing any book of the bible
8811334 looking through the eyes of someone who has had trouble understanding the bible this could be a refreshing alternative
8811335 the goal of the chronological study bible is not to replace the time honored canonical arrangement but instead to honor time as the setting in which the biblical record appeared readers who study this bible will return to their traditional in canonical order bibles better equipped to read them
8811336 this is what keeps us on the road 70 of the time
8811337 we see different reactors in different conditions and we know this removal has to be done very fast we dont want to give more time to people who are preparing to steal this material
8811338 that was a big challenge from the security point of view and from the point of view of keeping it secret
8811339 but we had a constant exchange of information with the bulgarian security services
8811340 it looks just like any other barge business as usual on the danube
8811341 we are very concerned about this material we take this threat to be very real the information that we have lets us know we have to act as aggressively as possible to remove this material
8811342 even if you think that there is a one per cent or half per cent chance of there being such a catastrophic event its probably worth taking a lot more precautions than we are at the moment
8811343 if people insist on the same standards for radioactivity we have now we would have to give up large areas of the city people would ultimately have to get used to the risk of going back to a slightly contaminated part of london
8811344 i really dont know why an attack hasnt happened already
8811345 an image a day and an mp3 to go with it for no obvious reason
8811346 the square of the sum of a number and 6 is equal to 49
8811347 the sum of the square of a number and 6 is equal to 7
8811348 w 4 3 6 and w 3 4 6 4 w 6 3 and 3 w 6 4
8811349 in a sea of similarity 2008 nfl icons rises above the rest to give collectors superior and innovative content that has not been seen before
8811350 there are plenty of autograph and memorabilia cards but the look is different as they are printed on stunning rainbow board some inserts are also die cut to give icons its own look the addition of these letterman cards is really designed to give collectors a new collecting experience we think they will enjoy
8811351 i knew i need a triple so as soon as i hit the ball im going to go to third
8811352 they were going all crazy and i was just thinking about boone a little bit
8811353 but as soon as he hit the ball everybody was go three go three go three all the way
8811354 i didnt know what was going on until everybody went to screaming
8811355 i was just trying to sit there and get some air or whatever and i look at the board because everybody was screaming in the dugout and i was like oh thats why so i went to screaming too
8811356 you get that two run lead in the first inning its kind of the last thing you want to do is give up runs especially that many
8811357 we have to go out there and win a ball game to start making us feel good right now it doesnt feel too good
8811358 it was just a great feeling in a season full of some not so happy memories
8811359 weve been playing well of late and its just good to see smiles on everyones face
8811360 what a great come from behind win just a great win i mean exciting
8811361 this place really got loud i dont know if it was the loudest ive heard it but let me tell you what it was loud
8811362 i mean ive been able to do that since i was in the minor leagues
8811363 ive always been able to drive in runs its something im proud of and i like to be in that situation late in the game
8811364 fontenot hit a homer and all of a sudden its a two run game and we got the top of our lineup coming soriano got on base and theriot got on base we got a good team
8811365 we shouldnt be going through this this is our time to hold these leads and its our job were not getting it done right now
8811366 yeah to think about how well cole threw the ball and how well our guys put at bats up against dempster its a tough one
8811367 that was a situation where we couldnt get people out actually the last game and most of the last games that weve lost thats kind of how its been
8811368 thats what we were laughing about two in a row whoo
8811369 i was just kind of looking in one zone for a pitch to hit
8811370 you always want to be in that spot to be able to drive in the winning run any time you can get a hit like that its fun
8811371 weve been through some tough times the last month and a half we didnt play well or swing the bat well thats part of it tonight we got some big hits thats contagious when everybody is struggling at the same time thats contagious too
8811372 i know hes always going to give me a good at bat and thats all you can ask for when a guy comes off the bench cold
8811373 hes had success this year and confidence grows from that
8811374 were on a long road trip and weve been battling things a lot ourselves so were just trying to figure out how to do a little better job on the road trip
8811375 we know what happens here with us and the as its always a battle its always good baseball two teams that play the game the right way hustle bust their tails
8811376 we saw the rally monkey come out and knew it was time
8811377 youre certainly dealing with the reality that theres no way were going to be able to catch the angels so we just wanted to come out and win a ballgame
8811378 ive got to tip my hat to the boys they did some damage there in the eighth
8811379 i outlasted their starter and we got into their bullpen
8811380 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8811381 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have it
8811382 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country i will never hesitate to defend this nation
8811383 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8811384 im enjoying watching barack obama i think hes a brilliant speaker i think his optimism and sense of hope for the future is inspiring a lot of people its great to see too often politics gets down to hope and fear and i think its wonderful when hope wins im enjoying watching him i must say i think hes compelling
8811385 hopefully getting past these barriers mentally and numbers wise we can put that in the past and become the organization were envisioned on becoming
8811386 i think you have to give those guys some credit over there
8811387 theyve got a pretty good pitching staff that will shut you down
8811388 i made a couple of mistake pitches and they hit them over the fence
8811389 im really proud of the fact that weve really raised the level of our intensity despite only having 12 000 people in the stands
8811390 theyve been very professional about this thats the part i really appreciate about it also youd like to see 36 000 every night but for right now the way our guys are going about our business im very proud of them
8811391 im a lifelong republican i voted for nixon reagan bush and bush but i literally cannot afford four more years of this
8811392 einstein said a definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result if we elect john mccain then according to einstein we surely would be insane
8811393 i want a government that takes care of barney smith not smith barney
8811394 because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
8811395 we may not agree on abortion but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping ak 47s out of the hands of criminals i know there are differences on same sex marriage but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination passions fly on immigration but i dont know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers this too is part of americas promise the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort
8811396 although further research needs to be conducted qigong may be an effective complementary treatment for osteoarthritis
8811397 esta noite os americanos assistiram a um discurso enganador que est em contradi o fundamental com o magro hist rico de barack obama
8811398 o fato que barack obama ainda n o est pronto para ser presidente
8811399 has given everything he could to his country except his life
8811400 art in the age of steam europe american and the railway 1830 1960
8811401 art in the age of steam europe american and the railway 1830 1960
8811402 hes manipulating all his little kingdoms and empires from afar
8811403 for better or worse and its not always for better it is my natural state i cant help it
8811404 i cant tell you how surreal a dream that is for me
8811405 i think of all the headaches and fires that i have to put out and the problems that i have but its the thing you wish for so how can you really ever complain
8811406 a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more because of the failed policies of george w bush
8811407 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8811408 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8811409 good luck you are one hell of a thinker and speaker certainly compared to the current occupant of the white house along with your opponent we not only need someone who instinctively knows how to say the right thing on tv we need someone who believes in thinking through our problems and soliciting the advice of smart people not loyal dumbasses like brownie
8811410 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8811411 freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one
8811412 in all things of nature there is something of the marvelous
8811413 hes just saying that because he wants to bone me
8811414 hes just saying that because he wants to bone me
8811415 i cant talk to anyone like i can talk to you even my ex boyfriend
8811416 like at one point i was thinking like to maybe stop at the end of this year so i guess maybe now im going to think about like keep playing
8811417 not at this moment no let me think about it so i make sure i say something real politically correct
8811418 this was tough you know when a coach doesnt want to hear a player opinion even if im wrong but at least he can talk he can listen and then we can discuss and not always say his opinion so i think this is the reason like why we started to fight a lot on the court and then it was not i mean i have enough stress on the court playing a match and if i go on practice and im still fighting with my coach i dont need this
8811419 shes kind of an idol in france everybody loves her
8811420 shes pretty much relentless i better be ready that girl is a tough cookie
8811421 yeah its very different because the way i enter these tournaments now is completely different i used to be favorite and now im more of really not knowing whats going to happen and how my game is going to be so its i dont know if i savor it more its more surprising probably
8811422 whether its urgency a must or a need weve got to win some ball games
8811423 now we have to play the mets head to head theyre must wins
8811424 its no secret were running out of time theres no margin for error
8811425 i didnt think i had a chance to get it
8811426 that ball everyone in the stadium and everyone else thought it was out except the left fielder its a game of inches
8811427 i didnt even look at it that catch was the game
8811428 pick your poison it was either chipper or him its a decision you make sometimes it works and sometimes it gets you mccann is a major league hitter and an all star and he got us
8811429 this one size fits all approach is unfair to smaller communities who by nature cannot generate the money needed to recover from the storm
8811430 just two weeks after a heavy flood that affected a big part of our city the federal government is shutting the door in rensselaers face
8811431 dari pada allah kita datang kepada allah jua kita kembali
8811432 lazy they just need to put their foot down and show these kids whos boss
8811433 piece of cake when i have kids ill have mine potty trained in no time after all this practice
8811434 shall we have it oak like and spicey do be tender with my imminent bender
8811435 i came here with a close close close friend so that she could get two body parts pierced
8811436 a time passed we have lost knowledge of the precise location of the temple and anyone entering the temple mount is liable to unwittingly enter the area of the temple and the holy of holies
8811437 entrance to the temple mount and the defilement of the holy of holies is more severe than any of the violations in the torah
8811438 in short the radbaz a leading halachic authority from the 1500s ruled that the dome of the rock is the foundation stone in the holy of holies he wrote that without a doubt this is the identity of the place he wrote in a definite way the definite identity of the place
8811439 according to those measurements we can do all the calculations
8811440 this is the essential source on which people who visit the mount rely
8811441 to this day its unclear why its forbidden from a halachic perspective what is the prohibition against someone going up theres no clear answer given by those rabbis
8811442 he who knows of the permission knows he who doesnt doesnt he who doesnt know needs to learn the problem is that he who doesnt know doesnt sit down and learn
8811443 he did cut the work week from fifty six hours to fifty four hours but he also increased the speed at which the looms ran in order to keep from losing profits the workers were angry that they were working just as hard and producing just as much as they would in a fifty six hour week but only getting paid for fifty four hours during the strike the police found explosives in three different places along the mills
8811444 on february 2 1926 william wood had his chauffeur take him for a drive once they were on a deserted road he got out of the car walked out of his drivers sight pulled out his revolver placed it in his mouth pulled the trigger and ended his own life
8811445 we are witnessing the development and acceptance of a new moral code in america
8811446 mosaics have had little exposure to traditional moral teaching and limited accountability for such behavior
8811447 there are a couple of levels to turning an innocent child into a terrorist
8811448 the first one is pumping him up with hatred the second one is training him with weaponry so that he will feel empowered you put that together with the weaponry and when he grows older he will be a terrorist
8811449 zionists we will strike you anywhere kill you and defeat you until you leave our land
8811450 i began learning how to make bombs and resist the jews when i was 14 years now i am able to make hand grenades and land mines
8811451 now we manufacture a local grenade it is a plastic tube we fill it to the top with tnt and wrap it up with tape and here is the result
8811452 we dont play like other kids because we are a part of jihad
8811453 and it is made by our people here is the ammo clips with bullets in it it can fire here is a sound grenade and this one is an explosive grenade and here is the safety valve
8811454 he feels like he is in control he knows how the weapons work it makes him feel way way beyond his age making him feel like hes going to be a fighter hes going to kill with it
8811455 i always tell people take off your cultural glasses and put on the glasses of the other culture
8811456 you wake up in the morning and you rush to the newspaper to see how your baseball team did last night and these people get up in the morning and theyre praying for the destruction of the christian and jewish worlds replaced by islam that we shall finally win the crusader wars its a different world view
8811457 look at the us in iraq everybody was opposed even their allies but they did not listen and what happened they do not know how to get out of it now now we understand that we are all linked to the us and if it falls apart it would be a real collapse we have to help them to get out of there that means that cooperation is needed a new world order is necessary and global mechanisms to manage it
8811458 this league of democracies would not supplant the united nations or other international organizations it would complement them but it would be the one organization where the worlds democracies could come together to discuss problems and solutions on the basis of shared principles and a common vision of the future if i am elected president i will call a summit of the worlds democracies in my first year to seek the views of my democratic counterparts and begin exploring the practical steps necessary to realize this vision
8811459 yes there have been differences between america and europe no doubt there will be differences in the future but the burdens of global citizenship continue to bind us together a change of leadership in washington will not lift this burden in this new century americans and europeans alike will be required to do more not less partnership and cooperation among nations is not a choice it is the one way the only way to protect our common security and advance our common humanity
8811460 in this new world such dangerous currents have swept along faster than our efforts to contain them that is why we cannot afford to be divided no one nation no matter how large or powerful can defeat such challenges alone
8811461 with climate change and globalisation the ageing of the population is one of the major challenges europe must face
8811462 from 2015 onwards deaths would outnumber births and population growth due to natural increase would cease
8811463 positive net migration would be the only population growth factor however from 2035 this positive net migration would no longer counterbalance the negative natural change
8811464 might permit an innocent american to be subjected to such intrusive surveillance based in part on race ethnicity national origin religion or on protected first amendment activities
8811465 integrate more completely and harmonize the standards that apply to the f b i s activities
8811466 simply based on somebodys race religion or exercise of first amendment rights
8811467 this document clarifies the rules by which the f b i conducts its intelligence mission
8811468 this seems to be based on the idea that the government can take a bunch of data and create a profile that can be used to identify future bad guys
8811469 but that has not been demonstrated to be true anywhere else
8811470 there is a lot of inappropriate conversation being tolerated by women so as not to antagonize men in their workplaces
8811471 we train our bishops and district superintendents and local pastors in what to do when somebody brings a complaint of this nature how it is to be processed and handled we want to be able to deal with it openly honestly and expeditiously
8811472 every station has been getting information from kc scout fed to them every six to eight minutes
8811473 this is hooked up to the sensors so when speeds go from 58 mph to 20 mph you can see it as it happens
8811474 russia may deny its help to the united states in resolving some major problems for instance the one with iran
8811475 dont bother we dont work on bikes that old and its not worth much
8811476 youre throwing out all these numbers like you know how much these bikes cost
8811477 its amazing how many club officials read fire brand of the american league

8811482 corporate cartographers are demolishing thousands of years of history not to mention britains remarkable geography at a stroke by not including them on maps which millions of us now use every day
8811483 were in real danger of losing what makes maps so unique giving us a feel for a place even if weve never been there
8811484 but its not just google its nokia microsoft maps on satellite navigation tools its diluting the quality of the graphic image that we call a map
8811485 internet maps can now be personalised allowing people to include landmarks and information that is of interest to them
8811486 anyone can create their own maps or use experiences to collaborate with others in charting their local knowledge
8811487 these traditional landmarks are still on the map but people need to search for them interactive maps will display precisely the information people want when they want it
8811488 its the first time the industry has really pulled together to deliver one consistent method of reassurance for the motorist
8811489 primarily through a compliance visit to the garage to make sure that they are who they claim to be and are doing what they claim to be able to do
8811490 consumers need to know that when they take their car to a garage they are going to be treated in an honest and reliable manner
8811491 by using a garage that has an approved code customers can be assured that they will receive a much higher standard of protection than required by law
8811492 de svigtede mig allesammen selv peter som sagde at det kunne han aldrig finde p alle svigtede de mig de er mig ikke v rd
8811493 okay paperback books go here new ones go here and blahblah blah
8811494 it is right and proper for each nhs to use its own policies and standard operational procedures to meet the differing needs of their national populations
8811495 it shows that the systems are different but not necessarily better or worse
8811496 we have four diverging systems but they are still trying to deliver the same thing
8811497 we had a flag route called and they brought two on the blitz and i turned around and caught the ball
8811498 i turned around and a little guy tried to tackle my legs last week i got tackled at the two yard line and they chop blocked me i figured they were going to try to do that again i just stiff armed them and saw the end zone the little dude tried to tackle me up high and i drove him for a couple of yards especially when i saw the end zone was so close i just wanted to make it in
8811499 i thought that david carr did a nice job tonight
8811500 we were able to rush the ball we were able to do a few things early on trouble on our special teams and our cover teams late but we were able to hang in there and win a game we got a lot of people to play we saw a lot of versatility so it is a good way to finish up the preseason for us
8811501 i was just trying to contribute to my team as much as i could
8811502 i was just trying to make plays and get better every play i felt tonight was a real good night to develop chemistry with the team i also felt we started to come together even though the starters werent out there the second and third strings were also contributing which is really important for this team to develop depth i felt we did pretty good tonight with so many different guys in
8811503 im glad the change came early enough in preseason so that i could get acclimated to the position and get enough reps going into the regular season i have 100 confidence that i will get the job done this year it wasnt 100 for me i know im not where i need to be i know im not where i can be im not playing up to my potential yet but for having one week of practice with my hand in the dirt i felt good about it
8811504 well if you dont want that kind of filling then you could come back in and have it removed and we could replace it with the other kind
8811505 i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8811506 i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans
8811507 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8811508 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8811509 to end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaida and the taliban in afghanistan
8811510 not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8811511 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8811512 have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8811513 ok i am upping my rating for the following reasons 1 i can always get a seat if i want one 2 music is 90 good which is commendable in

8811518 i ended up stripping the whole north wall and it ended with a real problem
8811519 my opinion is that we have a house wrap that doesnt perform to a standard acceptable for humans to live in
8811520 just taking a quick look at it the house wrap material is supposed to be impermeable
8811521 id say its not limited to just this house this is kind of what everyone was doing 15 years ago

8811523 no it doesnt and its been a myth for 30 years what makes houses rot are openings in them
8811524 its been a pretty big problem for a number or years here
8811525 in your honest opinion do you think this is the only house out there like this
8811526 no id assume there are hundreds of houses out there like this
8811527 well obviously its moisture damage i dont know if the house wrap failed or not thats something a chemist will need to look at
8811528 were a family on a budget and so we also need a place to live so we have one mortgage weve got to deal with and were not anxious to dive into a second one or a rental or whatever

8811583 e giusto ripristinarlo perch dello studente bisogna avere la possibilit di valutare tutto dal profitto al comportamento
8811584 il decreto legge contiene molte interessanti novit giusto che nella valutazione generale dei ragazzi rientri a far parte con nettezza il giudizio sul loro comportamento altrimenti potremmo assistere al paradosso di giovani capaci magari anche studiosi ma privi di regole un pericolo quindi per gli altri e per il loro stesso futuro

8811653 the first thing we did was appeal to all the parties to stop the hostilities we have also sent out patrols to determine what has actually happened and we have combat helicopters on standby

8811656 it was in bear barrels quinley said the park service requires those to be used by backpackers in denali national park and suggests their use elsewhere to try to keep bears from becoming habituated to human food
8811657 weve got a helicopter scheduled so we can go to the campsite today
8811658 were not really sure its worth going in quinley said rangers doubted the bear would still be in the area

8811671 amid thin trading it is a given never to find yourself in short positions
8811672 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the past eight
8811673 on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
8811674 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8811675 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8811676 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 per cent of the time
8811677 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
8811678 i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8811679 a clean break from the politics of partisanship and bitter division
8811680 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8811681 i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8811682 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations
8811683 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8811684 and i want to thank the us americans and the germany and all my fans bff forever everyone
8811685 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8811686 at least they are not using public funds for their visibility campaign
8811687 for eight years weve seen what happens when a president lets washington values become more important than american values
8811688 gas prices skyrocket when the white house lets oil companies call the shots
8811689 and children are left behind when an administration cares more about sound bites than sound schools and middle class families are left to fend for themselves to save their grasp on the american dream
8811690 but for the rest of us the american dream means one home safe neighborhoods good schools and good health care does that seem like too much to ask
8811691 for barack obama for joe biden for me for all of us the principles of faith call us to service
8811692 for faith in the american dream we strive for better schools economic justice and smarter foreign policies including the god given principles of equality freedom and opportunity
8811693 we need to put our faith into action to elect a president who will invest in our students teachers and schools and make college affordable again for every american family
8811694 what an honor to be here on this powerful night what an honor to speak not just to those gathered here in denver but to homes across america and not just those owned by john mccain
8811695 looking out at this crowd and feeling the energy i can tell you this we are making history
8811696 i am here tonight not just as the governor of virginia who knows the people of my state need a better partner in white house not just as a democrat who is tired of politics as usual but most importantly as an american who wants to see american values guiding our country again
8811697 for eight years weve seen what happens when a president lets washington values become more important than american values
8811698 maybe for john mccain the american dream means seven houses and if thats your america john mccain is your candidate
8811699 does that seem like too much to ask john mccain thinks it is
8811700 hell keep answering to the special interests and washington lobbyists were ready for leadership that answers to us and the leader who will deliver the change we need is barack obama
8811701 if you have faith the size of a mustard seed you will say to the mountain move mountain and it will move
8811702 i learned from a great mentor there brother jim oleary that faith is about more than words or doctrineits about action
8811703 joe biden has also spent his lifetime putting faith into action overcoming unspeakable tragedy in his personal life and as a u s senator making our world safer our air cleaner and protecting women from crimes of violence
8811704 for barack obama for joe biden for me for all of us the principles of faith call us to service
8811705 with faith in the american dream we strive for better schools economic justice and smarter foreign policies because we believe in the god given principles of equality freedom and opportunity
8811706 arent we all tired of a washington that doesnt have any faith in us fellow delegates fellow democrats and fellow americans now is the time to let our faith guide us to action once again
8811707 we need to put our faith into action to elect a president who will put middle class americans first again and reward companies who create jobs in america instead of shipping them overseas
8811708 we need to put our faith into action to elect a president who will end our dangerous dependence on foreign oil and invest in green collar clean energy jobs right here at home
8811709 we need to put our faith into action to elect a president who will invest in our students teachers and schools and make college affordable once again for every american family
8811710 we need to put our faith into action to elect a president who will responsibly end the war in iraq give our veterans and their families the support they need and reinvigorate our military to face the challenges ahead
8811711 if we put our faith into action we can move mountains
8811712 we can move the mountains of negativity and division and gridlock
8811713 we can move the mountains of special interests and business as usual
8811714 we can move the mountains of hopelessness that surround too many of our people and communities
8811715 does anybody here have a little faith tonight is anybody here ready to move those mountains
8811716 starting right here in the mile high city we will put our faith into action we will reject the failed policies of george bush and john mccain we will elect barack obama our next president
8811717 theres reason to believe the democrats have been catching up
8811718 i dont know if theyll achieve parity this year but theyll surely be better than they were in 2004
8811719 i believe in recycling but recycling bushs policies is ridiculous
8811720 requires the union to agree to wiggss designation of an organization to receive her alternative dues payments once she proves the designated organization is both nonreligious and a charity wiggs met her burden of proof
8811721 we find that the examiners decision accurately states the law where a union agrees that an employees closely held religious beliefs qualify that employee to assert his or her right of non association as long as the employee designates a qualified non religious charity there is no legal issue for the commission to adjudicate accordingly we affirm the examiners decision
8811722 the union cannot exercise veto power over a teachers legitimate choice susan selected this charity because of her interest in rescuing children from exploitation unfortunately shes had to fight her own union for three years to send her money to this charity
8811723 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8811724 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8811725 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8811726 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8811727 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8811728 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8811729 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8811730 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8811731 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8811732 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8811733 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8811734 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8811735 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8811736 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8811737 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8811738 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8811739 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000
8811740 john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies all over again
8811741 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man
8811742 if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8811743 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve experienced in the history of humankind
8811744 not only in the heat of this election but in the aftermath as we put his agenda to work for our country
8811745 has taught him something that career politicians often overlook that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance
8811746 if we have to reduce those kinds of dollars its going to be pretty draconian
8811747 it would be a large personnel reduction i would try to keep it away from direct patient care areas because if they affect the payment rates we would still see the patients

8811756 requires the union to agree to wiggss designation of an organization to receive her alternative dues payments once she proves the designated organization is both nonreligious and a charity wiggs met her burden of proof
8811757 we find that the examiners decision accurately states the law where a union agrees that an employees closely held religious beliefs qualify that employee to assert his or her right of non association as long as the employee designates a qualified non religious charity there is no legal issue for the commission to adjudicate accordingly we affirm the examiners decision
8811758 the union cannot exercise veto power over a teachers legitimate choice susan selected this charity because of her interest in rescuing children from exploitation unfortunately shes had to fight her own union for three years to send her money to this charity
8811759 ich empfehle beiden den ger teherstellern und anbietern mutig den weg nach vorn zu gehen

8811761 im very free in my work im in my films what i cant be in life sometimes i imagine that people might be disappointed when they meet me if im not in life what im in my films
8811762 what this takes is some real fighters to oppose it on behalf of the communities involved
8811763 i have found no benefit for the people of the 14th district in this proposed merger
8811764 clearly that proposal is well short of the requirement to significantly minimize any negative impacts this sale might bring about
8811765 instead of having an east to west problem youll have a north south east and west problem
8811766 there could be significant railway bottlenecks without some significant financial rebuilding of the rail system im not so sure that you dont answer one problem with this move but put three more on the table in doing so
8811767 its about creating the learning environment for children into the future
8811768 more administrative and staff driven this one is a more community driven process
8811769 this purchase will add nothing to the communities along this line there is no benefit which will accrue to our community only problems
8811770 we have no intention to be enslaved by a railroad
8811771 i dont want anyone to have this in their backyard

8811776 the finances of the psuv are public and transparent the campaign will be exclusively sustained with money raised by the sale of the bonds and donations of party members
8811777 since the internal campaign of the psuv started we have constructed all the programs based on meetings with the communal councils land and health committees mission mothers of the barrio and the rest of the organizations of popular power and in this way we can offer improvements to the quality of life of the population
8811778 it is necessary to bring to life the reality that is socialism on the small scale where every citizen feels that their proposals are discussed that they are listened to and that in some way they are contributing to the construction of the country that we want
8811779 you all must work together from the youth in the drive of the social movements and give a national character to the youth movement of the psuv so that it doesnt remain in the municipalities
8811780 socialist youth to set them selves up as the most powerful voice of self criticism of the party
8811781 the youth are synonymous with rebellion against the establishment against what is bad rebellion against the diversions rebellion against the old vices
8811782 nobody should have any doubts between the large estate owners and the indians this government is with the indians
8811783 demarcate the indigenous lands with the participation of the indigenous councils
8811784 we must demarcate the lands because it is in the constitution and in the law
8811785 there is a man alejandro vargas who is walking free he is not in jail if that man returns i will put a spear in him
8811786 we the yukpa are free whether or not we the yukpa have an identification card that is not important the zone of the sierra de perij is free
8811787 there is a law i cannot just pick up a spear and kill somebody because if i do the law will come looking for me
8811788 the hacienda owners do not know what the demarcation is so we need to tell them this is the demarcation
8811789 we have to co live out here we are going to commence round table dialogues about demarcation here in this zone
8811790 the indigenous people are guaranteed territory here here we are going to build a school we are going to develop tourism out here
8811791 i was brutally detained friday night five national guardsmen beat me with their rifles and helmets for a period of 15 minutes they detained us without any charges saturday we were taken to the courthouse and judged for disturbing the public order we were not threatening the national guard officials in any way we were simply recording what was happening
8811792 we all realized there was a systematic plan by the state and the national guard
8811793 they intended to criminalize the activity that was being carried out by the yukpa and their allies
8811794 how can a fully armed and equipped military official actually call us paramilitaries
8811795 what is happening in the sierra de perij is that all the military officials are against us this is why we are calling on the national government to buy these lands for us
8811796 at times we are feeble spirited we name a commission and a year goes by and they travel and they travel again and they have a meeting here and there and two years go by but there is never a solution to the problem
8811797 these are the old vices of the past that is called bureaucratization and this has to come to an end

8811809 sir peter has undertaken a critical body of work and has provided the government with a number of key recommendations on how we can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our application of ict to service delivery
8811810 sir peter has conducted an extensive series of consultations with a range of stakeholders from within government the ict industry and related representative organisations
8811811 he has applied his extensive experience obtained in major strategic reviews in the uk with an evidence based approach and has developed a range of robust and achievable recommendations for the australian government
8811812 with sustained leadership and drive at ministerial and top official levels and by providing the enablers of change with the necessary resources not only in funding terms but also skills of the right calibre the australian government through implementing these recommendations can drive significant improvements in its use of ict
8811813 i am confident that the recommended actions and proposed changes can be successfully implemented over the next two to three years and will deliver substantial benefits to the australian government

8811868 really i was surprised in high school how quickly people made decisions about you
8811869 i never thought first impressions would count as much as they did in high school but they count for a lot overcoming that is really something you have to work toward
8811870 in the long run of life you probably wont remember most people you knew in high school in 10 years time
8811871 get to know everyone networking is important in high school too

8811885 obviously this is sen mccains decision and his announcement and we all want to be respectful of his desire to have the chance to announce it himself
8811886 it the rule of law does not mean drivers licenses for illegal aliens nor does it mean that states should be allowed to flout the federal law barring them from giving in state tuition rates to illegal aliens we oppose amnesty
8811887 amnesty has to be an important part of any immigration solution because there are people who have lived in this country for 20 30 or 40 years who have raised children here and pay taxes here and are not citizens that has to be a component of it
8811888 it revolves around money and that money revolves around drugs
8811889 this was the cleanest crime scene ive ever walked on

8811920 i just feel like for this moment that we can we would be crazy not to its such an amazing medium its such an interesting process
8811921 im hoping we create a show thats entertaining and as much fun as we think it is and hope it is
8811922 i dont think any one show can save the fall but i think a great show is something that we all want so i look forward to seeing the reaction
8811923 the biggest challenge was trying to make it relevant to now to do it despite it being star trek he said
8811924 its a question of how do you make it something that would be what it wants it to be even if it hasnt been a series before you invest completely in the characters and you tell a story that is good regardless of the setting
8811925 there oughtta be a test its like the person who brings a sign for badlands pay attention man
8811926 she wont set herself on fire for me any more
8811927 wow hes having a lot of fun on that look at him hes smiling
8811928 we wanted to be around other people who support him

8811930 i just want them all to be watching it happen from left daniel mireles rachael long and kali fajardo all of denver gather with hundreds in lodo to watch obamas historic speech at a vip reception outside the jet hotel on wazee street photos by evan semon special to the denver post this is a time in our country when we are united regardless of his race we are uniting for a need for change
8811931 ive been trying to make it down here all week
8811932 its the last day so its the best day to be here were watching history in the making man and we want to be with our people
8811933 going to these watch parties is how we have connected with americans
8811934 i never thought i would live long enough to see this happen
8811935 i told my children this would not happen in their lifetime and probably not their childrens lifetime maybe in their grandchildrens lifetime
8811936 the baton was passed off tonight to the last runner
8811937 from hillary clinton to president clinton to joe biden to barack
8811938 i think that he is somebody who had to live on both sides of the aisle black and white
8811939 he really really believes americans can be one can live in peace in the world community

8811942 a type of system that the computer models generally have a hard time handling
8811943 usually we kind of expect retail prices to go up in advance of a major travel holiday
8811944 what may keep it from happening this year is a lot of people may stay put especially if they are nervous hearing the news and worrying about gustav
8811945 the biggest impact on crude oil prices is going to be the path that gustav takes
8811946 but i dont think were going to see it until tuesday
8811947 if were blessed to the point where gustav and hanna dont do any damage we would be in a good position to see gas prices to continue to come down
8811948 this industry is unique when it comes to applying the tax credit to certain aspects
8811949 we also have meetings set up with different segments of different studios that are specially interested in sitting down and talking about what georgia has to offer in the way of crew vehicles and tax credits
8811950 the things they teach in technical schools are really the heart and soul of the film industry
8811951 what were looking to do is bring studios here to make a long term commitment
8811952 there is a lot of talk going on right now its just a matter of time
8811953 i think were really going to start seeing a lot of activity here in georgia
8811954 this case is an excellent example of how u s and foreign law enforcement agencies share information in the international effort to investigate and prosecute individuals like this defendant who used the internet to collect images of children being sexually exploited
8811955 when we pulled up everybody saw us and started scattering
8811956 bj s place love peace understanding no drugs in here
8811957 this is the first weekend for regular season high school and college football games as well as special holiday events planned across the state that will all increase motor vehicle travel
8811958 we also expect more cars on the road considering the price of gasoline which has fallen in recent weeks
8811959 and make sure everyone is buckled up on every trip
8811960 heres to spending time with you guys and its not even a holiday
8811961 let the children come to me do not stop them the holy nation of heaven is made up of ones like these
8811962 its very satisfying to see a project this complex come to fruition
8811963 no one including the task force knew what the outcome would be it took many twists and turns
8811964 thats what inspired my interest it became really important to me
8811965 im thrilled and i applaud the city for sticking with it
8811966 i had not worked with government per se and i didnt have any expectation that it would take this long
8811967 it took a while for the city to figure out how to make it work financially
8811968 new york was doomed to seven years without the playoffs

8812007 market summary for august 28 2008 is the bear market over
8812008 mostly what this report will say is when you give somebody an 1 800 check he spends it
8812009 the american economy seems to be much more resilient than many forecasters had given it credit for
8812010 and the other thing we take from this is that trade is very important and that the stimulus package was well timed and seems to be working
8812011 many are states where for decades democrats have struggled but now we have a chance to win this is ladies and gentlemen a once in a generation opportunity
8812012 we can and we must elect a stronger democratic majority to the senate to overcome obstructionism that threatens baracks agenda and with your support we will
8812013 when a president has strong majority in both the house and senate it makes it much easier for him to push his agenda through the congress
8812014 but on the other hand the expectations are that he can do that and sometimes congress likes to wield their own power and show that they are more powerful than the president so it is not an absolute given that just because you have a democratic president and a democratic congress that it is going to be smooth sailing and that obama would get everything through because when all is said and done many of these congress members have to vote on the issue as their constituents back home would like them to vote and that is not always lock step with the president
8812015 two years ago the democrats were saying before the 2006 elections how terrible it is when one party controls all the branches of government that is just an invitation to abuse and to extremism
8812016 now that the worm has turned here you dont hear that from the democrats but im sure youll hear it from the republicans saying hey dont turn over everything in washington d c to the democrats the last time somebody did that it did not work well they wont mention that it was them

8812023 everyone knows that these us military advisors in georgia exist
8812024 unnamed persons in the united states provoked the conflict in georgia in an attempt to help a candidate in the u s presidential election
8812025 moscow suspected that u s nationals were present in the war zone in georgia and the russian military produced a copy of a u s passport it said had been retrieved after a bloody clash between russian troops and georgian special forces
8812026 but nato enlargement policy touches upon the future of the activities of the russia nato council
8812027 it is not just that the american side could not restrain the georgian leadership from this criminal act the american side in effect armed and trained the georgian army
8812028 why seek a difficult compromise solution in the peacekeeping process it is easier to arm one of the sides and provoke it into killing another side and the job is done
8812029 if that is true if that is confirmed then thats really bad

8812031 defensively the experience is back and they clearly had the upper hand tonight

8812034 i have been to the occupied palestinian territories many times and even though i realize that the soldier at the checkpoint is not responsible for israels oppressive policies that soldier is still responsible for his conduct
8812035 the bloody cycle in which i live made up of assassinations terrorist attacks bombings and shootings has resulted in an increasing number of victims on both sides it is a vicious circle that is sustained by the choice of both sides to engage in violence i refuse to take part in this choice
8812036 and my conscience will simply not allow me take part in the oppression of another people
8812037 there is no doubt that conscientious objection covers the case of military service for calling on people to be ready to kill when ordered or calling on them to engage in activities which perpetrate an occupation with the subjugation of people to the indignities and humiliation which occupations involve are clear cases where the right applies

8812041 the fact is that us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders
8812042 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
8812043 those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice

8812070 in this offense you dont know when someone is going to break a long run
8812071 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8812072 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8812073 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8812074 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8812075 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8812076 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8812077 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8812078 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8812079 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8812080 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience

8812088 if you dont youll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of congress give themselves
8812089 renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb russian aggression
8812090 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8812091 this is senator mccains decision and his announcement and we all want to be respectful of his desire to have the chance to announce it himself
8812092 we have some extremely high bandwidth users that consume a disproportionate amount of data and that can degrade service for others
8812093 to maintain a high quality of service for users weve gone with this
8812094 this wouldnt be necessary if comcast had chosen to expand its capacity

8812107 but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough
8812108 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8812109 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8812110 these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8812111 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain
8812112 they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
8812113 so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8812114 what i will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes
8812115 because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism

8812159 was making some recommendations and guidance will be reflected on the negotiating team
8812160 flexibility and responsiveness of the parties to reach an agreement that we can adopt and approved by the parliament
8812161 the proposed convention with the united states will not be long term convention but convention temporary and limited to a period of three years ago to regulate the temporary presence and the mechanism for withdrawal of u s forces from iraq requesting to be completed by the end in 2011
8812162 iraqs commitment to ensure that things may not wish to continue in the long run
8812163 it would provide better chance and more flexibility to officials of the two countries on the renewal of the convention or not the type and nature of bilateral relations when expiration of these three years
8812164 convention governing the security and long term presence of u s forces in iraq after the year 2008 it currently relies on the presence of un authorization ends on 31 12 this year
8812165 we share the same objective with the iraqi government a further transfer of security responsibilities to iraqi forces and make this good
8812166 we strongly believe that the withdrawal of american forces and coalition forces must be based on conditions in the field and what we have seen is the dramatic improvement of the situation in iraq with strengthened security situation and steady development of the capabilities of iraqi forces

8812169 oil companies they get tax breaks while we pay at the pump mcsame as bush
8812170 this bill does little to address the immediate energy crisis we face in this country
8812171 the handouts to big business and oil companies are irresponsible and will be disastrous for the people of arizona i cannot in good conscience vote to pass legislation that does not adequately address issues related to energy efficiency security and energy independence
8812172 heavy tilt toward big oil companies reflects the influence of exxon mobil and other oil companies on policy makers in washington dc
8812173 you can look at how dick cheney did his energy policy he met with oil and gas companies forty times and thats how they put together our energy policy
8812174 the one thing i have to remind folks though of weve been talking about this through republican administrations and democratic administrations for decades and the reason it doesnt change you can take a look at how dick cheney did his energy policy he met with environmental groups one he met with renewable energy folks once and then he met with oil and gas companies forty times and thats how they put together our energy policy weve got to put the national interest ahead of the special interest and thats what ill do when im president of the united states
8812175 im in washington i see whats going on i see those powers and principalities have snuck back in there that theyre writing the energy bills and the drug laws
8812176 cheney met with renewable energy folks once and oil and gas executives 40 times mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
8812177 barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today

8812184 in the automation contract even enigmatic distances because the offer and acceptance are expressed in evidence consent of the parties
8812185 such as natural mail council the decision was issued by the islamic fiqh academy provides for the possibility of holding the contracts of modern means of communication except the marriage contract and therefore no objection to sell or buy rights by such means if the selling and buying something known unknown and priceless known provided altkabd in the decade and this is not the options contracts futurologies leading to ignorance and tricked
8812186 was issued resolutions prohibiting sales of compound options or buying and selling by margin a real treat in this way to be cautious of sales corrupt or usury because engage in corrupt contracts haram and to engage in usury most sanctity of contracts
8812187 the buying and selling currencies may not be only on condition
8812188 meaning that the seller of the u s dollar price must be paid in jordanian dinars for example immediately in cash and cash and may not be the sales term

8812201 one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8812202 lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty
8812203 we have been going at top speed up to now
8812204 i hope that the justice department will raise some strenuous objections to this deal but the zero hour is upon us
8812205 when we announced our deal with yahoo we agreed to give the department of justice several months to review the deal before we began implementing it and we continue to cooperate with regulators as that process continues
8812206 ultimately we have confidence that theyll be able to conduct their review within that time period and allow us to move forward
8812207 after an accident like that people are a lot more cautious
8812208 that particular accident is very unlikely to happen again either because of improvements or the fact that substandard platforms arent here anymore
8812209 i think this is overdone because youre going to have shut ins at the very least and then well talk about what kind of damage we have
8812210 mr rockefeller how much money did you make last year oh 650 million or thereabouts how much tax did you pay on that oh i dont pay any taxes how is that possible mr rockefeller his answer i dont own any of it
8812211 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8812212 now i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8812213 we will do this washington washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and by the way john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8812214 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have for for while while senator mccain was turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 i stood up and opposed this war knowing that it would distract us from the real threats that we face you know john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8812215 and today today as my call for a timeframe to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration even after we learned that iraq has 79 billion in surplus while we are wallowing in deficit john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8812216 so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8812217 and thats to be expected because if you dont have any fresh ideas then you use stale tactics to scare voters if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from you make a big election about small things
8812218 i get it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8812219 what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
8812220 i disagree with the result reached here but i do so in the belief that my colleagues have helped in some small way to demonstrate the good and earnest values that animate this country values that require america prevail
8812221 les barraques en vercors pont en royans dans la dr me
8812222 we cannot give any name to russian troops other than occupation
8812223 russia is being ruled by former soviet security service agents who consider the end of the cold war as their defeat
8812224 its outrageous actions it would lead to the disintegration of russia itself
8812225 i think western pressure already put on russia has had its effect
8812226 it works and it will work because russia depends on the west its not the soviet union that was self sufficient
8812227 and so far only the terroristic organization hamas has supported russias recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia not a single state not even venezuela cuba so far they have not said anything in this regard
8812228 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction
8812229 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8812230 theres going to be a party at my pad tonight roulette poker you name it

8812232 you know my 75 year old grandmother has to wait outside an extra hour because you people suck
8812233 bottom line we have to stop with this notion of trying to get over this is a professional organization and it is run professionally and so the proper protocol was needed to participate period nothing against him i dont know the guy but we as black people have to set new standards on how we function crashing someones event is not the route to a better way and he was not the only author who just showed up and tried to be a part of the event they the other authors were discharged from the event too and with much less the drama he tried to create
8812234 anyone else care to kick it about this subject you got the right one plenty of time on my hands

8812246 we assert the inherent dignity and sanctity of all human life and affirm that the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed
8812247 we support a human life amendment to the constitution and we endorse legislation to make clear that the fourteenth amendments protections apply to unborn children
8812248 we all have a moral obligation to assist not to penalize women struggling with the challenges of an unplanned pregnancy at its core abortion is a fundamental assault on the sanctity of innocent human life
8812249 in the short term or even in the long term
8812250 id love to see a point where it roe v wade is irrelevant and could be repealed because abortion is no longer necessary
8812251 but certainly in the short term or even the long term i would not support a repeal of roe v wade which would then force x number of women in america to undergo illegal and dangerous operations
8812252 your position is that you believe theres an exemption for rape incest and the life of the mother but you want the platform that youre supposed to be leading to have no exemption
8812253 sen john mccain r ariz told abc news saturday that he still wants to change the gops abortion platform to explicitly recognize exceptions for rape incest and the life of the mother
8812254 mccain reaffirmed his difference with party doctrine on permissible abortion exceptions after speaking to the iowa republican partys lincoln day dinner in des moines
8812255 theres a process in place for the delegates to work on the platform and we are going to let that process work itself out
8812256 i think youre going to see a platform process that is going to maintain that plank
8812257 there are going to be a number of people supporting his nomination that want that plank left exactly as it is
8812258 i think he would be aborting his own campaign because that is such a critical issue to so many republican voters and the republican brand is already in trouble
8812259 i have come down on the side of stem cell research
8812260 we applaud the republican party and especially the members of the platform committee representing grassroots pro life republicans across the country for making such a strong and unequivocal stand supporting life at all stages
8812261 the work of the platform committee makes clear in no uncertain terms that the republican party is the pro life party

8812277 unfortunately as you can understand being a dedicated server provider there isnt a way for us to control the content on the servers we can only respond to
8812278 i will never know why this happened to me i have stopped blaming myself and all i can say now is that i was in the wrong place at the wrong time
8812279 i will never be able to forgive or forget this horrible experience this has given me a life sentence of shame nightmares and pain
8812280 the pain that i have experienced is a pain that i would not wish upon my worst enemy
8812281 he has not tried to limit his responsibility in any way he has not shied away from the enormity of what he has done
8812282 negotiations are frankly going nowhere with the government and we want an independent person to mediate it
8812283 we are hopeful this could be the key to our long awaited breakthrough
8812284 the sooner they can set a date to sit down and talk about this the better
8812285 because if you didnt love yourself it would be hard to be happy
8812286 well if you dont love yourself it would be very hard to truly love anyone or anything else
8812287 hm well i think id still love ballerinas and trees you know things like that
8812288 because the earth is round it just keep going around and around so there is no edge
8812289 yes well there are other planets and moons and the sun and other stars out there but in between theres no air and its really cold and really dark and theres no sound
8812290 sure by the time youre a grown up it might be possible to just go on a ship but if youre an astronaut you can maybe go even if there arent ships for just anyone to go on
8812291 well they have to go to school a lot and learn many many things but once theyre ready they can go into space
8812292 all sorts of things they study light and stars and planets and sometimes try to find out if there are other creatures living in places other than our planet
8812293 nobody knows for sure none have ever been found but it is very very likely that there are somewhere
8812294 i want to be an astronaut and look for creatures
8812295 awesome ill do everything i can to help you do that
8812296 i dont need the church to get grace it is between me and jesus
8812297 sometimes i dont take it because i dont feel worthy
8812298 it is up to the people of god to decide how to worship if you dont like how we worship you can go to another church
8812299 if we have it too often it will be taken for granted
8812300 its a means of grace just like preaching and scripture is
8812301 all we need is the general absolution at the beginning of the service

8812308 all our bills are current and up to date all our rents are paid you have money flying through the door
8812309 people have got a complete misunderstanding of this so consequently im very confident
8812310 prior period adjustments arising out of a reassessment of accounting treatments
8812311 we have said publicly we will re look at every type of related party transaction
8812312 having said that its always been disclosed in the annual report theres nothing that weve ever hidden i think people just like to keep speculating on it to make it look like theres something sinister going on and theres not
8812313 absolutely not we have to be very conscious of separating the financial aspect of the business to what we actually do within the centres
8812314 contact your favourite politician and convince him that sri lankas priority should be to become the south asian hub
8812315 runways at two different locations will not make a hub of either airport
8812316 after all the bouts of construction sri lanka will still be a single runway country athulathmudali said
8812317 hence the need to construct a second well spaced runway this requires the political will to acquire land
8812318 if there is a will katunayake can become a hub for cargo and passengers serving south asia including non stop service to usa
8812319 many in the sri lankan airport sector have misguided views regarding what an alternate airport means
8812320 some have even misguided their hierarchy that there is a international mandatory requirement to have an alternate airport within sri lanka there is no such stipulation
8812321 though societies should fight terrorism with real resources mobilised from the society it is not advisable to use central banks nominal resources to fight such wars
8812322 this is because when inflation raises its ugly head it is also like a terrorist who has no mercy on anyone who fails to index his income with inflation
8812323 irrespective of the age sex wealth creed or race inflation impoverishes everyone a terrorist exerts fear in the minds of people
8812324 in the same manner inflation too exerts fear helplessness destitution and hopelessness in people
8812325 so a central banks best support for fighting terrorism by a government is to maintain price stability and help the society to create more wealth
8812326 for governments which are already constrained by a shortage of resources allocating resources for fighting terrorism means foregoing some other useful activity for which such resources could have been utilised
8812327 in order to raise the required resources many governments have resorted to taxation borrowing or simply inflating the economy by issuing currency
8812328 financing government expenditure by using inflation tax is what exter disliked most
8812329 he was a scathing critic of the fed running its printing press and debasing the value of dollar
8812330 having warned the others of the impending danger lying ahead exter used his expert knowledge to convert all his dollar assets to gold
8812331 there is no financial wizardry by which the bank can suddenly pull out of a hat a higher standard of living for everybody
8812332 the entry of employment objective into the law books of central banks is due to the belief that unanticipated inflation can influence output and employment
8812333 since unanticipated monetary growth brings about unanticipated inflation the argument boils down to the belief that unanticipated monetary growth generates output and employment
8812334 in other words if central banks could surprise people by raising money supply when they had not anticipated it at all there could be real gains that would cause the economy to expand
8812335 if on the other hand an inflation free world is created the environment would be conducive for fostering innovations and growth
8812336 hence real problems have to be resolved by using real weapons and not through nominal weapons which cannot influence real matters on a permanent basis
8812337 the money supply increases arising from the monetisation of the subsidy would definitely threaten the future price stability
8812338 if it does not further tighten the monetary policy the ensuing inflation would become uncontrollable
8812339 but tightening monetary policy would mean lower credit growth and high interest rates
8812340 hence the elimination of both terrorists actual terrorism and inflation should be done by any society
8812341 central banks could help the society to attain these twin goals by keeping monetary policy tight and creating an inflation free world

8812350 the fed is printing too many dollars and they flow out of the country into foreign central banks who demand gold
8812351 the bank of japan was running its printing press even faster than the rest of the world
8812352 market forces every minute of everyday try to restore equilibrium while central banks worldwide especially our own fed intervene every minute of everyday to prevent it so uncertainty abounds markets do not like uncertainty
8812353 the safest and most liquid asset will be gold it will be by far the biggest run out of paper money into gold in history
8812354 the best asset of all whether in inflation or deflation will be gold at the base of the pyramid accumulate what you can of it either above ground like coins or bullion or in the ground like unhedged mining shares
8812355 it would be by far the biggest run out of paper money into gold money in history i cannot say when but it is now months not years away
8812356 the way to a better life was through had work first in schools then in universities or polytechnics and then on the job in the work place diligence education and skills will create wealth not central bank credit
8812357 there is no financial wizardry by which the bank can suddenly pull out of a hat a higher standard of living for everybody

8812378 it was an outstanding drive we were able to complete passes and make plays and it was just a great way to start this year off
8812379 despite being down by so much at the half we came out and forced two early fumbles in the second half
8812380 we had field position and couldnt get it in the end zone i thought our young fullback micah moore ran very well in the first half against their starters
8812381 our crowd was unbelievable we just really had no answer to their passing game it was a good opponent to start with and hopefully it will help us get ready for our region schedule
8812382 georgia hadnt won a conference title in 19 years or something and there was probably a reason why
8812383 i didnt know what it was and i didnt understand the league there was a lot of things i didnt know so going in i didnt know what to expect other than to try to get the thing going in the right direction
8812384 hes a leader hes always confident hes always going to pull for his troops always going to believe in his guys and we love that in him
8812385 watching him hes a guy that doesnt buy into anything
8812386 he realizes the only thing that matters is how we go out and play every week and how we prepare so thats the big deal around here
8812387 i didnt think we were very far away personnel wise
8812388 i thought it was more a matter of changing attitudes and beginning to believe
8812389 out of state were getting a lot more guys excited about hearing from georgia by a long shot
8812390 i really and truly dont think were a whole lot different than the last four five six years
8812391 after our first season i believed we could win the southeastern conference
8812392 thats what he does a good job of focusing on now focusing on the moment us not them
8812393 when were here we dont hear all the stuff outside were aware of it people are talking about it but youre going to always be measured by your results
8812394 right now i want to beat georgia southern thats all im really thinking about
8812395 the national championship is out of our hands im not worried about any style points im just trying to win
8812396 i know stafford is very interested in getting a picture with uga vii since thats his jersey number
8812397 youd like to measure the decibels when they do introduce him
8812398 were just practicing trying to get better and hopefully down the road after the next couple of games theyll get some experience but right now its just that it would be an emergency situation for them to go in and play right now
8812399 were not planning on anybody right now at this point redshirting as far as the secondary just because of the numbers
8812400 its reps they need reps its a hard position to get but they have enough talent that it might click on it might click on in a couple weeks one week whatever
8812401 depending on what time it is ill go with his wife katharyn but if i take too long shell leave without me
8812402 and he was like shoot man go see your son
8812403 i was just ready to play and went out and did my thing
8812404 he is our playmaker and a lot of things we do revolve around him
8812405 i thought backup colby clarington did a good job but we just never recovered
8812406 i though our defense did a good job all night of coming up with plays when we needed them
8812407 our guys fought hard all night and im pretty proud of that
8812408 defensively i thought we played well way too many turnovers though
8812409 if we dont turn the ball over as many times as we did we might have a chance to have a few more points
8812410 we needed that first game against supposedly the second best team in the state
8812411 that showed us what we need to work on and we have a lot to work on
8812412 he set the tone on that punt return early then he made some really big plays when he was rolling out against the grain
8812413 he had a good game for us i think the more he plays the better hell get
8812414 zenon is as good of a running back that i hope well see

8812426 as daunting as it was because it has such a die hard fan base and it has forty years of rules that you cant re write the thing that i think compelled us to do it is that its a very very rare to be handed a franchise that you loved as a kid that you grew up on are you kidding me you want to give us star trek are you insane youre going to do that and we at first we were scared not because we didnt think it was worthy it was we didnt feel that we were worthy of it so it became kind of about thinking all right well god if we were going to do this what did we really love about it what inspired us when we were kids and how do we get back to that feeling and what was that feeling about for us and ultimately i think it was very much about kirk and spock and that bridge crew that was a big part of it so what got us through the fear was the excitement of that opportunity which really comes probably once in a lifetime
8812427 our version of star trek is not exactly a prequel
8812428 it is in some ways and you will have to see it to label it exactly
8812429 broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8812430 the central premise of star trek the experience is that alien researchers and scientists along with their necessary support staff and materiel were transported via a temporal rift from the late 24th century to present day las vegas to study and interact with the various cultures of 21st century earth
8812431 the rift however has recently grown unstable therefore the time station must be abandoned
8812432 extensive research was done to assure the ceremony which rings down the curtain on the seventy nine million dollar 65 000 square foot complex will follow the actual procedure for decommissioning a u s navy vessel as closely as possible
8812433 in keeping with over forty plus years of established star trek themes of exploration and cooperation we felt the pride in being a part of that legacy should be reflected in a dignified but joyful leave taking although we wish we could do so much more our fans and friends expect nothing less since the june announcement of our closure weve received tens of thousands of e mails and messages of support the outpouring of affection is just overwhelming and is visible as our wall of memories just inside the attraction we hope that everyone who has ever felt or wanted to be a part of our star trek family will join us on september 1st to help celebrate over ten years of one of the most thrilling interactive attractions ever conceived
8812434 thats the way it is with heroes nothing is ever as it seems on the surface and youll manage to see a bit more of me throughout the season
8812435 i told them i havent been a bachelor for over two decades so it could not be what it should be but they brought in hunks who didnt have a thing on i said whats the point this is radio but it turns out they have cameras for a subscription only tv show
8812436 isolating shots and shot quality lets one better assess goaltending
8812437 batall n de percusi n cl sica y ex tica
8812438 estar en la b squeda constante de nuevas maneras de lograr expresi n utilizando lo que existe en la orquesta y fuera de ella
8812439 elle tait peut tre nerveuse plus que moi en tout cas a poursuivi la fran aise elle avait la pression de se battre pour garder sa place de n 1 mondiale elle a t bless e r cemment un pouce cest difficile pour les joueurs de sa stature alors que pour nous tout est du bonus
8812440 i did a few hours of work for one of his non profits
8812441 not fair hes a conservative wheres our side not fair
8812442 my candidate did not win or get nominated so i gonna disrupt the entire process until i do win
8812443 rodham was invited by moderate new york republican representative charles goodell to help governor nelson rockefellers late entry campaign for the republican nomination
8812444 but if the goal was bigger he would have scored 100
8812445 last season was the sixth lowest scoring campaign in the past 50 years and goal scoring is trending downward
8812446 last season was the sixth lowest scoring campaign in the past 50 years and goal scoring is trending downward
8812447 this follows every other technology that turns out to have information of forensic value i think what were seeing is evolutionary
8812448 there are several other government agencies that still have misguided rules in place that unfairly undermine the attorney client privilege
8812449 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime
8812450 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured
8812451 ten years ago when i talked about school choice i was literally tarred and feathered
8812452 i was literally brought into a broom closet by a union and told i would never win office if i kept talking about charters
8812453 d c schools chancellor michelle rhee is negotiating what is probably the most aggressive union contract in the country shell be able to fire teachers but also be able to pay them more
8812454 the american federation of teachers which i dont think does anything for the people of the district of columbia is weighing in against it
8812455 and the only thing i can think of is that the heads of the union they want to keep their jobs
8812456 in the democratic party you have to be realistic about some coalitions that are wedded to the past on education
8812457 lets not be wedded to somebodys union rules an adult agenda wins too often in our present union situation
8812458 new mothers and their families are educated about postpartum depression screened for symptoms and provided with essential services
8812459 ive heard rumors that thats happening but theres no confirmation of that at this point

8812487 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory lets declare in once voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate
8812488 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver the change everybody know we need barack obama will deliver that change
8812489 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8812490 yes he can but we have to first elect him
8812491 john sided with with president bush 95 per cent of the time thats not change thats more of the same
8812492 together we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8812493 hemos estudiado dos proyectos de construcci n del gasoducto uno de 300 kil metros que recorrer a el sur dominicano hasta hait y otro que ir a por el norte tambi n hasta hait pero que volver a a territorio dominicano y que constar a de casi 700 kil metros
8812494 debemos aclarar que cada pa s rep blica dominicana y hait ser an responsables del costo de construcci n que ata e a sus respectivos territorios
8812495 si finalmente se concluye en la opci n del gasoducto de menor recorrido estimamos que su construcci n debe rondar entre los 12 y los 24 meses
8812496 el pa s necesita una revoluci n democr tica y construir a machete su destino
8812497 nosotros estamos comprometidos con la naci n por eso planteamos una nueva forma de hacer pol tica decente sensata y objetiva

8812499 el sentir nacional se encuentra exaltado por las calamidades y por los peligros que lo amenazan se impone ahora un llamado oportuno para poner de pie a la naci n y comenzar a construir a machete su destino
8812500 haremos un gran esfuerzo para rescatar el pensamiento democr tico del pa s y construir una nueva opci n de poder en la rep blica dominicana para hacerlo posible tenemos que vencer el desaliento fomentando la credibilidad con una nueva forma de hacer pol tica

8812505 las pol ticas estropeadas de washington y la fallida presidencia de george w bush
8812506 estados unidos ahora no es momento para pensar en peque o
8812507 esta noche le digo al pueblo estadounidense a los dem cratas y republicanos e independientes a lo largo de este gran pa s es suficiente
8812508 john mccain ha votado en consonancia con el presidente bush el 90 del tiempo
8812509 el pa s necesita una revoluci n democr tica y construir a machete su destino

8812512 el pa s necesita una revoluci n democr tica y construir a machete su destino
8812513 its not that john mccain doesnt care its that he doesnt get it
8812514 barack obamas speech tonight laid out his specific bold solutions and optimistic vision for our nation and our childrens future
8812515 his speech crystallized the clear choice between he and senator mccain four more years of the same failed policies or a leader who can tackle the great challenges we face revitalizing our economy and restoring our standing in the world i am proud to support senator obama our next president of the united states and joe biden our next vice president of the united states
8812516 it your vision for america that has been your vision
8812517 its not that john mccain doesnt care its that he doesnt get it
8812518 i fear susan is beginning to succumb to the dark side
8812519 the use of language and other communication methods to create oh sorry to say this word change
8812520 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8812521 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8812522 in the muslim school the teacher wrote to tell mother i made faces during koranic studies
8812523 the actual usage of the word mengaji in indonesian and malaysian societies means the study of learning to recite the quran in the arabic language rather than the native tongue
8812524 the fact that obama had attended mengaji classes is well known in indonesia and has left many there wondering just when obama is going to come out of the closet
8812525 as ive stated before the evidence seems to quite clearly show that both ann dunham and her husband lolo soetoro mangunharjo were in fact devout muslims themselves and they raised their son as such
8812526 we previously often asked him to the prayer room close to the house if he was wearing a sarong he looked funny
8812527 barry was previously quite religious in islam his birth father barack hussein obama was a muslim economist from kenya before marrying ann dunham hussein obama was married to a woman from kenya who had seven children all the relatives of barrys father were very devout muslims
8812528 as i was listening to fox news contributor charles krauthammers astute commentary on obamas speech
8812529 ive got a jug of poland spring water here i am hoping it turns into pinot noir when he speaks
8812530 demonstrated the experience and the capacity to carry out the proposed trust fund activity
8812531 dont have a record to run on you paint your opponent as someone to run from
8812532 i suck but im better than 4 more years of bush
8812533 we cant have the same old politics and same old players
8812534 new politics for a new time this is one of those moments
8812535 the republicans who never thought theyd pick up a republican ballot
8812536 again he barack obama carries with him the history of tonight and its important to point out as we have not so far barack obama was not given this nomination he won it he was not offered a nice title like secretary of state like condoleezza rice got from the republicans he was not offered the title of chairman of the joint chiefs as colin powell was or secretary of state he won the nomination of a democratic party voting together he defeated all other opponents and took the prize and took the leadership he is the chosen leader of the democratic party he is not some popular appointment or a showcase appointment he is the victor here tonight thats why he dictates the agenda thats why he says personally what the democratic party will do if hes elected president he is the leader of the party he may be the leader of the country through a democratic process it is so vital to understand the history being made here tonight this is not something cute or wonderful it is something compelling and powerful this country has changed its history
8812537 so now we know he can put on a show and he can put on a concert we will need more than music to get our country on course again

8812548 theres nothing really new to report on senator mccains decision i think well all hear from him shortly and hopefully well be able to move forward together
8812549 the united states is now more dependent on foreign oil than it ever was
8812550 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8812551 let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8812552 our government should work for us not against us it should help us not hurt us
8812553 it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every american whos willing to work
8812554 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families
8812555 because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8812556 and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and 5 million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8812557 stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8812558 we may not agree on abortion but surely we can agree on reducing the number of in this country
8812559 the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the while keeping ak 47s out of the hands of criminals

8812591 they sell off a little bit of themselves each time they stick out their hand
8812592 it turns out the democratically controlled 110th congress maybe more worthless than the bunch that preceded them if thats possible the democratically controlled congress handed president bush exactly what he wanted more than he asked for even legislation that broadly expands the administrations power to eavesdrop without warrants on americans international phone calls and emails

8812601 after today we should no longer talk about unity but a united march to victory
8812602 this is more billy graham than it is a political rally

8812614 im not really in control here some larger force is actually in control and im just being allowed to exist in their world
8812615 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8812616 spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8812617 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8812618 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8812619 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8812620 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 per cent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8812621 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8812622 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8812623 next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third and we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
8812624 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8812625 we want to see more passion to make it clear he understands what ordinary folks are going through every day a former campaign aide to mrs clinton said before the speech during her narrow defeat by mr obama for the nomination the former first lady was skilled at relating to struggling families
8812626 we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
8812627 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8812628 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8812629 i am actually going to take this information back home we can do this to

8812663 la victoria hace que el nimo te cambie para todo pero no hay tiempo para festejar ni mucho menos porque tenemos un partido muy importante contra santos

8812867 ten days ago the price was rs 11 300 and retail outlets recorded consumer demand many times higher than that witnessed during dhanteras the first day of diwali or akshaya tritiya when buying gold is considered auspicious
8812868 se de fato uma empresa de propriedade do google est tirando dinheiro dos associados do google ent o esse um problema real
8812869 a d vida na mente das pessoas saber o quanto o google se manter isento enquanto cresce e cresce mais
8812870 quando h p ginas do knol em boas coloca es est o l porque conquistaram essa posi o
8812871 nossa vis o continua sendo a de que precisamos ser o melhor canal condutor poss vel para fazer a conex o entre o que quer que seja que as pessoas est o procurando e a resposta seja qual for
8812872 por essa raz o n o estamos interessados em possuir ou criar conte do
8812873 nossa tarefa que a de organizar essa informa o entra em a o
8812874 o google pode dizer que n o est no setor de conte do mas est pagando s pessoas e distribuindo e arquivando seu trabalho est ficando cada vez mais dif cil defender esse conceito
8812875 eles est o competindo por talentos por an ncios e por usu rios
8812876 o about com est em uma posi o muito boa no mercado
8812877 partindo do princ pio de que o google trata o knol exatamente como trata outros sites da internet trata se de mais uma empresa produzindo conte do
8812878 n s participamos do google knol como um teste como fizemos com outras ofertas semelhantes
8812879 estamos avaliando sua efici ncia em novas percep es de constru o de marca para o webmd
8812880 this is the same system we have in place today
8812881 the only difference is that we will now provide a limit by which a customer may be contacted
8812882 an extremely large amount of data much more than a typical residential customer uses on a monthly basis
8812883 as part of our pre existing policy we will continue to contact the top users of our high speed internet service and ask them to curb their usage
8812884 if a customer uses more than 250 gb and is one of the top users of our service he or she may be contacted by comcast to notify them of excessive use
8812885 at that time well tell them exactly how much data per month they had used we know from experience the vast majority of customers we ask to curb usage do so voluntarily
8812886 though the proposed cap is relatively high it will increasingly ensnare more users as technology continues its natural progression
8812887 if comcast has oversold their network to the point of creating congestion problems then well disclosed caps for internet use are a better short term solution than comcasts current practice of illegally blocking internet traffic
8812888 giving millions of dollars of taxpayers money to rich companies to allow them to continue polluting is immoral and uneconomic
8812889 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher toward the 120 level
8812890 if this turns out to be a non event the market could really come roaring back down
8812891 we began contracting out cardiac surgery cases to other centres two years ago and in the past year we have ensured that we are fully utilising every feasible public and private avenue in new zealand
8812892 that has brought considerable success the number of patients waiting over 6 months peaked at 120 last july and we have now managed that down to just 25 i believe we have turned a corner
8812893 while we are capable of meeting current demand there is a backlog of high priority patients and in that context the decision to outsource to an australian hospital with the capacity to perform that surgery within the next three months makes sense
8812894 as a cardiac surgeon i believe this is an appropriate one off measure which should enable us to get on top of this backlog
8812895 we will be contacting patients who may be suitable to travel to australia and discussing this as an option with them it will be entirely their choice as to whether they wish to pursue this option
8812896 if they are interested in pursuing this option and if we and the australian surgeons agree they are a medically suitable candidate we will make the necessary arrangements for the patient and a support person to travel to australia for their surgery and to return to new zealand after an appropriate recovery time post surgery
8812897 if they decline or for any other reason do not go ahead with the australian option the patient will retain their place on our waiting list and we will book them for surgery here
8812898 its the middle of the cold and flu season so beds are in limited availability nationwide and the reality is we need to proceed with surgery for these high priority patients now not in six months time to ensure any risk is minimised
8812899 we will be using a single provider which will help to streamline the coordination between the dhb the provider and the families and we are also aiming to station a dhb person in australia to help co ordinate things on the ground for those families
8812900 over the past year we have been sending these types of patients to providers around new zealand for surgery including otago auckland waikato and christchurch so in one sense the biggest change in going to australia is its a longer flight
8812901 of course heart surgery is never without risk and we are being upfront about dealing with that including the risk of mortality
8812902 naturally we will only be sending those patients who are declared medically fit for the journey
8812903 if things go this way then i will do this
8812904 in connection with these investigations a number of the companys subsidiaries were visited and documents seized
8812905 he raced at a time when racing was extremely dangerous and got through it all without a serious injury
8812906 he had an extraordinary mechanical sense he was very much in tune with the car
8812907 i as well as all employees of ferrari are extremely saddened by the news of the passing of phil hill a man and a champion who gave so much to ferrari
8812908 phil and i have always kept in touch throughout the years and i know i will miss his passion and love for ferrari very much
8812909 and he knew it off the top of his head he was extremely intelligent and well rounded he was an opera expert and very well read he was very sophisticated
8812910 phil was a very special guy and had a love for the automotive age
8812911 he was always a potential winner when he sat in a race car he was both a competitor and a close friend and a fellow i could look up to
8812912 once i got out the situation i found out a lot of people wanted to deal with me i had to make the right decision capitol was a better look for me i had people that believed in me as an artist plus they have the machine to take me to the next level
8812913 e quando j descia ao tumolo deste me a vida
8812914 wherever it comes its going to come with a big wallop
8812915 my personal opinion is this is going to go on for a very long time
8812916 it is going to be a long time but there are plans in the works
8812917 the biggest thing were going to need are volunteers to help with the rebuilds and funding to buy supplies
8812918 since a lot of homes were substandard to begin with its not really solving the problem
8812919 i think thats where youre going to see more unmet needs
8812920 there are some very passionate people who are locally down there who are going to build this long term recovery organization to really go do some serious good work
8812921 not that this hasnt happened it the past but there is a truly renewed hope that is spreading through many organizations instead of just one group wanting to go it alone theres a true sense that the community wants to respond as community
8812922 do you think price controls would not stifle research you dont want insurance to pick up the
8812923 okay so you dont want price controls cause that would stifle research you dont want

8812928 whos out of control whose life is out of control give me a break going from place to place being dragged around by samantha so she can make more money off of lindsay being there when she spins
8812929 i know barack obama is gonna set this world on fire
8812930 its not that john mccain doesnt know its that he doesnt get it
8812931 when products get too old the manager will reduce the price so they sell more quickly this allows new products to be put on the shelves and the store can make some money instead of throwing out the expired products
8812932 when products get too old the gt manager will reduce the price so they sell more quickly this allows new gt products to be put on the shelves and the store can make some money instead of gt throwing out the expired products

8812938 i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8812939 i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans
8812940 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8812941 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8812942 to end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaida and the taliban in afghanistan
8812943 not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8812944 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8812945 have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8812946 thats why im here i have to be part of this its one of many things that will happen in the future that will make america even greater
8812947 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8812948 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8812949 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy
8812950 so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are here to restore that legacy
8812951 we can not meet 21st century challenges with 20th century bureaucracy
8812952 the results of human action but not of human design
8812953 the natural law concept against which modern jurisprudence reacted was the perverted rationalist conception which interpreted the law of nature as the deductive constructions of natural reason rather than as the undesigned outcome of a process of growth in which the test of what is justice was not anybodys arbitrary will but compatibility with a whole system of inherited but partly inarticulated rules
8812954 i have become a pluralist but there are many pluralisms
8812955 i believe that a democratic society is not and cannot be a community where by a community i mean a body of persons united in affirming the same comprehensive or partly comprehensive doctrine the fact of reasonable pluralism which characterizes a society with free institutions makes this impossible this is the fact of profound and irreconcilable differences in citizens reasonable comprehensive religious and philosophical conceptions of the world and in their views of the moral and aesthetic values to be sought in human life
8812956 in effect there are two ways to agree we agree on what is correct or on who has jurisdiction who gets to decide freedom of religion took the latter form we learned to be liberals in matters of religion reaching consensus not on what to believe but on who gets to decide so too with freedom of speech isnt it odd that our greatest successes in learning how to live together stem from agreeing on what is correct but from agreeing to let people decide for themselves
8812957 the peculiar character of the problem of a rational economic order is determined precisely by the fact that the knowledge of the circumstances of which we must make use never exists in concentrated or integrated form but solely as the dispersed bits of incomplete and frequently contradictory knowledge which all the separate individuals possess
8812958 today it is almost heresy to suggest that scientific knowledge is not the sum of all knowledge but a little reflection will show that there is beyond question a body of very important but unorganized knowledge which cannot possibly be called scientific in the sense of knowledge of general rules the knowledge of particular circumstances of time and place
8812959 the sort of knowledge with which i have been concerned is knowledge of the kind which by its nature cannot enter into statistics and therefore cannot be conveyed to any central authority in statistical form
8812960 we cannot expect that this problem will be solved by first communicating all this knowledge to a central board which after integrating all knowledge issues its orders we must solve it by some form of decentralization

8812970 after the game it was announced the dodgers would purchase the contract of former first round draft pick scott elbert to make his major league debut clayton kershaw was optioned to class aaa las vegas but it was more of a procedural move and he is expected to make his next start
8812971 after waiting a day to reconsider their options the dodgers as expected designated right hander tanyon sturtze for assignment allowing them to activate reliever cory wade from the disabled list

8812989 the disaster response staff in new orleans and port arthur texas are literally battening down the hatches and moving our physical assets which can be moved such as vehicles and tools to higher ground
8812990 weve identified churches that can be staging areas for whatever the appropriate response is
8812991 potentially going to be the largest hurricane to come to the united states and make landfall since katrina
8812992 there are a lot of mixed emotions due to the fact that its so close to the katrina date
8812993 it has people very concerned its that time of the year when people are emotional over the anniversary date
8812994 there are people who have lived here forever and want to stay put until they know its a category 3 and its headed directly at them and there are people who have moved here since the storm or who have rebuilt and arent anxious to stay and are getting out of town
8812995 were taking steps here at elca headquarters to manage information and receive calls regarding donations and volunteering well do regular check ins with all our local coordinators as time goes
8812996 we certainly right now have the luxury of time to do the kinds of intensive planning that we always wish we would have in response to disasters because the storm remains many days out
8812997 for a very wide circle of people to be involved in that planning and conversation
8812998 has taken steps to evacuate the presbyterian volunteer villages in louisiana and mississippi
8812999 we will monitor any conference calls and well be ready to go
8813000 i think were much better prepared than we were three years ago were about as prepared as we can be
8813001 there are long term recovery organizations now in place within the parishes that are up and operational there are networks of nonprofits faith based organizations that now have connections and communication lines that werent there when we had katrina
8813002 but people are in a much better place to be able to respond and respond quickly and more efficiently and effectively than we did with katrina irregardless of the size of the event whatever it is and however bad it might be i think people are prepared as best they can be at this point
8813003 since hurricane katrina cws has worked extensively along the u s gulf coast building capacity among long term recovery groups to prepare for future storms
8813004 cws emergency response specialists will be in contact with recovery groups and emergency officials to assess needs provide training material resources and project development support
8813005 new orleans doesnt need any testing of its levees although it would be nice to know that they work
8813006 its low so even bad thunderstorm can cause us to have standing water anything of that magnitude causes us concern because of the water surge
8813007 they have been so hard hit already and another event of this magnitude would continue to devastate those areas and all of the recovery work that had already been accomplished
8813008 tiene que cubrirse el formalismo legal de que la expedici n de ese documento sea en un territorio en que jurisdiccionalmente y soberanamente el estado pueda hacer ese trabajo que muy puede ser en la embajada o el consulado dominicano

8813020 no hay trabajo ahora y estamos pasando hambre con los muchachos
8813021 yo no quiero fundas es que nos den vuelta para que vean la situaci n de uno llueve y llueve y aqu no viene nadie
8813022 en una primera fase lo que vamos a hacer es alquilar algunas casas para que se puedan alojar ah porque la verdad es que viven en niveles de riesgos extremos
8813023 la cifra de 2008 refleja que pese al deterioro del contexto econ mico internacional marcado por altos precios del petr leo y de los alimentos la regi n completar cinco a os de expansi n sostenida un fen meno que no se daba en cuatro d cadas
8813024 the 2008 statistic means that despite the global problems from the high price of oil and food this region will complete five straight years of economic expansion a phenomenon it has not seen in four decades
8813025 everyone was asking me before what it was going to be like i was like i dont know i havent talked to her in 10 or 15 years i had that tension and i started to let it get to me is she going to be nice is it going to be a bad environment but when i saw her everything was fine
8813026 i think when youre 18 your personalities conflict then you meet up 10 or 15 years later and the playing ground is totally different and youre fine
8813027 it let me find a little bit of peace and discover who i was as a person
8813028 not the person who the press made me out to be because id had a few bad experiences in my personal life and i was struggling to figure out a bad husband or a bad boyfriend and i was doing it under the spotlight so i wasnt reacting well to any of it
8813029 i dont think we ever hit each other scratching im not going to deny that
8813030 all those people who wrote the i hate brenda newsletter are going to get mad at me now like why are you leaving your child with brenda
8813031 its something that helps many parts of our programs and our district
8813032 i think it does have an effect it brings a level of excitement to the program
8813033 when you look at facilities in our greater western ohio conference division we were by far lacking centerville had turf fairmont had turf wayne has a nice facility we didnt have a lot
8813034 it makes us feel like were one of the big guys and you can tell the excitement in the kids
8813035 the level of confidence is higher than in the past
8813036 that hasnt happened in a long time were appreciative but the thing for us is how we handle success we havent been in this situation in a long time
8813037 but lisa is probably better as a senior all around than erin or sarah
8813038 thats because she learned a lot from both of them and alex about the game
8813039 i feel like my understanding of the game is my best asset
8813040 ive grown up around the game watching my sisters play in college we talk about the little things that go into the game and why a team or a player does this or that
8813041 so i can recognize whats happening on the court pretty fast react and talk to help my teammates get in the right spot to make a play
8813042 the one area i want to become stronger in is passing i do ok but being a great passer really helps your team be better
8813043 swimming is a great break from volleyball and is great for keeping in shape
8813044 our whole family lives at fair valley in the summer i really love swimming if i wasnt playing volleyball i probably would have been a competitive swimmer when i watched the olympics i probably watched more swimming than i did volleyball
8813045 does evil exist and if it does do we ignore it do we negotiate with it do we contain it do we defeat it
8813046 my first two years at dps we saw 13 kids leave
8813047 it really hurts the coaches and illegal recruiting is statewide kids want to go where teams are winning and parents want them to go where players are going to college so they leave
8813048 im drawing from a city of 22 000 and they have almost a million people in the five county area around cleveland to draw from
8813049 those nike combines the scouting combines all those are a big waste of money
8813050 if you show on tape you can play or go to the camps and run a good time theyll offer you a scholarship
8813051 you dont have to go to trotwood or go to wayne or go to northmont if youre good theyll find you
8813052 we need someone like kay barnes who will bring tax relief to the middle class its about time we had a representative who fights for the little guy
8813053 ive been playing solid and at times putting lights out
8813054 my ball striking has been the best its ever been
8813055 i just want to be the best i can be
8813056 i like his relaxed tempo even tempered approach he doesnt get too excited
8813057 michael plays the game in an almost robotic manner hes business like and respects the game there are very few weaknesses in his game
8813058 he has a relentless work ethic is a golf fanatic who watches the golf channel constantly and practices his putting on mats he has at home
8813059 greenville country club frustrates golfers because of the narrow fairways and small greens
8813060 sam played smart golf and didnt pull out the driver a lot in favor of his 5 iron he won the medalist race by six or seven strokes
8813061 somebody ripped my jersey one of my lineman told me he threw a guy off me well see how that goes on film
8813062 i was just keeping my eyes down field i looked down at the receiver and he was still running his route he did a good job getting open i just let it go
8813063 i couldnt urinate it hurt just to move my legs i always had a high temperature and when i did urinate just blood came out
8813064 i couldnt breathe they had to put me on oxygen right away
8813065 they had me hooked up to all these ivs i felt sick to my stomach and couldnt move without intense pain
8813066 i kept slowly drifting away and i wasnt tired at all my eyes would get heavy my stomach was hurting and then i lost all feeling in my arms and just slowly drifted away each time i woke up i would be in so much pain then when id drift off id wonder if it was the end for me
8813067 but once wed gotten over the initial shock we teased him like we always did you can bet that were on top of it when it comes to mrsa though none of us want that to happen to us weve seen its not good
8813068 i just tell them to wash their hands wash your uniform if you have an open wound tape it up and they get it
8813069 ive gone to camps at ohio university uc bowling green and toledo
8813070 im anxious to show colleges im good enough to play for their school
8813071 classic philly motown and 70s black disco meets the creativity of the beatles and bob dylan it just felt to me that a lot of stuff out there sounds the same its a time for change for something else
8813072 whats great about the bigger cities are the numbers of interracial couples who come
8813073 im seeing a cross between the girls who want to come out and have fun and the couples who come to enjoy a loving environment
8813074 im not voting for obama because hes black im not voting for obama because hes green
8813075 heute zumindest haben wir den schlanksten flachbildfernseher der welt selbst wenn es nur f r ein paar stunden w re
8813076 da ist der bildschirm so d nn dass sie sich ihn auch um den arm wickeln k nnen
8813077 i guess we figure the tougher the teams we play the better we are going to be
8813078 if you would have asked me then having a tougher schedule wasnt a good thing
8813079 but in hindsight it forced us to raise our level of play
8813080 we have a fairly strong team with high goals and that helps us get right into it
8813081 some of the matches we played then we dropped because we moved forward
8813082 we wanted a greater challenge once we got acclimated we continued to build a stronger schedule
8813083 i think increasing our competitiveness certainly helped us become one of the best programs in the state
8813084 my parents didnt want me to play football because they thought id get hurt
8813085 thats the first thing i thought when i got the call at work
8813086 it had been tough because of the unknown just not knowing
8813087 i told him if it comes down to it its just one game thats my kid i want to make sure hell be able to lead a normal life
8813088 a lot of people were expecting me to be nervous but i went out there and hit it head on and took it as it was and loved it
8813089 in four or five years he has an opportunity to get his name called at the nfl draft you dont find bodies like that that are that mobile
8813090 its all based off of his feet its not just his size
8813091 he has outstanding footwork hes so agile hes got long arms so hes a natural left tackle
8813092 the offers are just on the physical tools he brings to the table how hard schools push him to commit depends on how he does this fall
8813093 i knew a lot of people said id get something off of my size i guess a lot of coaches like my footwork and everything
8813094 it just shocked me i guess it kind of came easy to me at first but then it makes me want to start working harder and harder
8813095 i was just being a little bit childish in a couple classes
8813096 having olympic field hockey on television is a teaching tool
8813097 it shows the game is played by men and women at the highest level in the world the olympics are on artificial surface which makes the game they play a lot faster than the high school level but it shows the stick handling passing shooting skills how to play defense and goalie play
8813098 our staff taped all the games so now if the girls have a question or we want to get a point across weve got olympic field hockey games as a visual aid
8813099 we only have a few girls who played at state but we took along a lot of kids who are playing this year just so they could get the feeling of being in a state tournament
8813100 were young 10 freshmen eight sophomores and eight juniors so it could be rough early against a real tough schedule
8813101 but by tournament time we could be a very good team
8813102 we have a lot of experienced players with good skills obviously we hope well get better as the season goes along and make a run at state
8813103 we have a number of staff who are contractually exempt from industrial action
8813104 the plan is to continue to put out the newspapers absolutely as normal and we are well advanced in doing that
8813105 we see no concern in getting the papers out tonight saturday and sunday and monday and beyond if necessary
8813106 im all for efficiency the problem is no one in management has come and spoken to me or my immediate boss about how we can achieve that
8813107 it has just been this blanket email go out and what that causes is hysteria and for people to be scared
8813108 we dont want to see a media thats being able to be stood over by big business or the government
8813109 i dont think they are breathing but i am not sure

8813144 our brothers in kuwait told us that they are not demanding any debt and that there is no need to discuss this issue
8813145 the goal is to do it in a way that you dont feel awful about yourself you treated someone with respect

8813150 it shows startlingly poor judgment and management skills and cowardice on your parts

8813205 toda esta situaci n de irregularidad y de incumplimiento de la normativa legal para locales de actividades recreativas y de espect culos tiene que ser la causa que ha originado que durante m s de dos a os el alcalde se haya negado a facilitar este grupo municipal la informaci n y la documentaci n solicitada sobre las medidas de seguridad del teatro municipal en funcionamiento desde el 28 de junio del a o 2006 sin ning n tipo de licencia ni autorizaci n oficial que ampare su apertura

8813262 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
8813263 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
8813264 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
8813265 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant

8813311 over the past weekend our sailors cyclists swimmers and rowers won an unprecedented eight gold medals by far the greatest haul by britons in two days in a century of olympic competition of the 14 heroes pictured on the front page of yesterdays mail six were educated at independent schools nor is this some statistical anomaly the disproportionate olympic success of privately educated contestants has been an enduring pattern in recent years equality of outcome is the central theme of the politically correct british state the concept of a talented elite is despised rather than celebrated excellence should not be encouraged for fear of lowering the self esteem of those who lag behind the sale of playing fields to make way for lucrative housing developments then there is the growing feminisation of the teaching profession where more than 90 per cent of primary school teachers and 60 per cent of secondary teachers are women a development that again leaves many sporty boys unchallenged the commons select committee on culture recently demanded that our national sporting body uk sports should collect more information on the backgrounds of top athletes such data the committee said would help increase the socio demographic spread of funding in other words the committee wants more social engineering more drivel about equality more intervention in the name of access this is the sort of nonsense that has ruined state education and it would only undermine our sporting competitive spirit

8813316 nortel continues to innovate in wireless technologies like lte leading the way to the next generation of true mobile broadband to support the demands of hyperconnected users
8813317 todays telecommunications market is experiencing a massive trend towards hyperconnectivity as more people and devices become connected with the increasing popularity of bandwidth intensive applications over mobile devices like laptops and smartphones wireless operators need to prepare to offer a complete personal broadband experience
8813318 operators can leverage the capabilities of lte to allow subscribers to take their personalized versions of the web their videos their social networks their music their business tools with them wherever they are
8813319 mature telecommunications markets can also maximize the content rich applications and services enabled by lte to drive new revenue
8813320 nortel the lg nortel jv and lg electronics are accelerating the commercialization of lte and showing consistent progress towards end to end interoperability to ensure alignment between infrastructure and devices
8813321 during our three years of collaboration we have set the bar for innovation in lte showing the world how true mobile broadband can bring us the highest quality communication and entertainment no matter where we are

8813324 we received a complaint that there may have been a possible violation of the greenlandic law regarding the protection of narwhals after the discovery of cadavers in illoqqortoormiut
8813325 but there are rules that say you cant shoot females and that you have to remove the body
8813326 were now trying to investigate the incident and figure out what has happened and if the law has been broken
8813327 these are all strong indications that t costata may be the earliest example of marine overexploitation
8813328 our discovery that t costata was already on a trajectory of decline prior to this period corroborates this hypothesis by providing the first circumstantial evidence that humans were not only using but also depleting reef resources making t costata the likely earliest victim of anthropogenic degradation of coral reefs
8813329 declining marine and terrestrial resources by human and climatic factors respectively may have acted in concert to thwart the precocious but short lived colonization of the near east by anatomically modern but technologically primitive humans at the end of the last interglacial
8813330 this could have a devastating effect on the marine environment and negatively impact chuuks tourist industry
8813331 some areas of mangroves that provide breeding grounds for many fish species could be completely decimated
8813332 there is reason to believe that hoyo maru is leaking from her bunker which means there could be a lot more oil left to spill were hoping that japanese historians can help us to determine if she went down with a full tank so we can estimate the full scale of the threat
8813333 time will come that the thresher sharks will disappear and we dont want to be blamed for not doing something to protect them
8813334 im sure there are people who buy at a high price thats why they are hunting the sharks but we have to explain to these people that they will earn more if we dont kill the sharks and we can develop a tourism industry
8813335 the extent of the fishery situation with regard to the thresher sharks in the batangas bay area is absolutely in my honest scientific opinion not sustainable and youre on the risk of losing your sharks
8813336 the most powerful emissary for ocean conservation in our history
8813337 i cant overstate the impact of this single animal on advancing our mission to inspire conservation of the oceans
8813338 we have in 50 years turned our ocean into a plastic soup
8813339 the solution we think is to end the age of disposable plastic
8813340 these are not innocent little bits of confetti theyre poison pills they are like sponges for pollutants
8813341 we need to clean up our own house before we tell other people to stop sending rubbish to our beaches and shores
8813342 we traveled through the gyre collecting debris and they marine life also traveled through the gyre collecting debris

8813362 to chairman howard dean and my great friend dick durbin and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
8813363 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition thats beyond your reach
8813364 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8813365 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8813366 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president
8813367 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8813368 if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him
8813369 we wouldnt be facing a self inflicted economic crisis wed be fighting for middle income families
8813370 we would not be showing contempt for the constitution and we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving the climate crisis
8813371 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8813372 barack obama is telling us exactly what he will do launch a bold new economic plan to restore americas greatness fight for smarter government that trusts the market but protects us against its excesses enact policies that are pro choice pro education and pro family establish a foreign policy that is smart as well as strong provide healthcare for all and solutions for the climate crisis
8813373 anyone who looks at al gore and whats happened over the last eight years knows whats at stake
8813374 its an object lesson for democrats who are contemplating the choices at stake in this election
8813375 our whole goal is to turn the 75 000 people here in this stadium into grass roots volunteers
8813376 this is all about neighbors talking to neighbors family members talking to family members
8813377 its a dream of mine come true an unbelievable miracle
8813378 last time i worked for a presidential campaign was mcgovern
8813379 obama is getting people excited who havent been excited for a long time
8813380 registration deadlines will be here before we know it so we need to reach out to every single person who we think might support barack obama and joe biden and get them registered
8813381 and over half the states have early vote so voting will begin in earnest in a lot of places in about five weeks there is no time to lose
8813382 never again will a disaster of this nature be handled in the terrible and disgraceful way its been handled
8813383 has always taken into consideration national emergencies we are monitoring the situation very closely
8813384 at this juncture we are moving ahead with the planning of our convention and there have been no changes to our schedule of events we obviously share the concerns of many americans as we watch the developments
8813385 were not stepping up and solving the problems like we should were good at finger pointing and were good at talking about the way the world should be but were falling short on delivering those ideals
8813386 get motivated get excited get inspired and tomorrow we get to work to get him elected
8813387 im going to watch them and ill know what to do to win
8813388 the history here thats not too impressive of a record
8813389 hopefully we can add on to that a little bit more
8813390 certainly not the way we drew it up the thing thats really painful for me and the staff is you want to give people a reason to believe
8813391 i feel like we let a lot of people down
8813392 i was proud of them it would have been easy to come here and not be ready to play
8813393 i dont know if ive ever been this nervous about an opening game weve always played well as the underdog but i was really concerned about having that top 25 ranking coming in here
8813394 kirbys been through some ups and downs we felt like he deserved the opportunity and we gave it to him
8813395 i thought griffin provided a spark which is what he has to do for us
8813396 unless all residents are trained to operate the fire extinguishers there is no legal requirement to maintain these in communal areas of residential blocks
8813397 as part of the assessment the assessors now look to see whether fire extinguishers are actually required in that particular block in some cases they are no longer needed and provide more of a hazard being there we do not want to encourage people to leave their flat to fetch a fire extinguisher from a hallway and then return to a blaze we want people to get out safely obviously in some cases an extinguisher could come in useful in a communal area but with new building regulations every escape route should be completely fireproof it very much depends on the individual property and what the assessor believes is the correct course of action
8813398 we wanted to come out and give a great show for the fans and i think we did some great things on defense and some good things on offense
8813399 its a big ball game for this team and for south florida and an opportunity for us to go up there and play a great opponent
8813400 theyve got a tremendous offense tremendous defense and we feel great for the chance to go up there and play such a great team
8813401 things didnt happen the way we wanted but youve got to expect that out of any football game
8813402 especially when youre playing such a good opponent like miami
8813403 i put my teammates in positions that they could make plays not me
8813404 i learned if i could give the ball to my teammates everything will be ok i dont need to be the one going out there making spectacular plays
8813405 it felt like we had a junior or senior out there playing quarterback
8813406 i was here and i remember wolf blitzer and anderson cooper talking about it that night
8813407 performers are citizens and in the u s we are allowed to talk about our beliefs its also the privilege of people not to listen
8813408 the interesting thing about celebrity involvement is that theyre the only group of so called lobbyists who stand to gain nothing from what they do except to support the causes they believe in
8813409 its all about heart and i have a big heart
8813410 you want noel playing through the middle 25 times a game so were going to be smart and figure out what he does best and what gives him the best chance for success
8813411 im doing more to be above average and working harder than everybody else im looking forward to proving myself
8813412 its like a business and i had to learn that
8813413 you will be a better running back when you study the game being around the coaches and being in the meeting rooms they know their stuff and that made me want to know my stuff i have to know where the holes will be and who ill have to block
8813414 they need to feel comfortable in the backfield because in their first year they are going to be nervous
8813415 being a leader and being in their shoes last year im trying to step up and help them learn
8813416 im kind of like a fan in that i cant wait to see these guys play
8813417 you can put any combination of guy out there and a lot of special things can happen you give them the ball and they can go to the house from any place on the field thats a great thing to have
8813418 you being a running back and you have other people coming in and taking the carries it helped the team so i cant complain too much
8813419 coach meyer hes always getting in your grill to get things right
8813420 hes a perfectionist it really made me jump on the horse study the playbook more and think about football even more than i was
8813421 im starting to play like how i play and not really thinking about what the schemes are and what steps i have to take it comes natural to me know
8813422 everywhere you go somebody wants a picture somebody wants an autograph somebody wants something from you
8813423 even when it comes from friends its hard to know who your friends are sometimes because everybody wants that association not everybody but a lot of people do thats something theyve got to deal with thats probably a little different than what they thought
8813424 we just talked about things other than football and got to know each other
8813425 anytime youre with herschel its really cool to be around him hes a good guy and a good person to be around i was pretty excited
8813426 im going to do the same things i did last year just try and get better each and every week and work on the small things to get us better as a team
8813427 we saw the rally monkey come out and knew it was time
8813428 youre certainly dealing with the reality that theres no way were going to be able to catch the angels so we just wanted to come out and win a ballgame
8813429 ive got to tip my hat to the boys they did some damage there in the eighth
8813430 i outlasted their starter and we got into their bullpen
8813431 thats what we were laughing about two in a row whoo
8813432 i was just kind of looking in one zone for a pitch to hit
8813433 you always want to be in that spot to be able to drive in the winning run any time you can get a hit like that its fun
8813434 weve been through some tough times the last month and a half we didnt play well or swing the bat well thats part of it tonight we got some big hits thats contagious when everybody is struggling at the same time thats contagious too
8813435 i know hes always going to give me a good at bat and thats all you can ask for when a guy comes off the bench cold
8813436 hes had success this year and confidence grows from that
8813437 were on a long road trip and weve been battling things a lot ourselves so were just trying to figure out how to do a little better job on the road trip
8813438 we know what happens here with us and the as its always a battle its always good baseball two teams that play the game the right way hustle bust their tails
8813439 but a wins a win we would have liked to do a lot of things better defensively than we did we are in no way satisfied we have to do a lot of things better
8813440 i was trying to make a play for the team but unfortunately it didnt work out that way
8813441 it didnt happen i have to learn from this and try to make better decisions
8813442 it feels like i didnt play football in two years
8813443 it feels good to be out there i picked up where i left off now just keep it going
8813444 it will be a hard game to watch on film because of all the mistakes well learn from this
8813445 hes up in it and hes running it doesnt take him a long time to get to full speed he has those instincts you come out of the crib with ive seen him in two games and hes been darn good
8813446 new classics of the fantastic will be an essential science fiction library it will bring back hugo and nebula award winning books that have fallen out of print sadly most award winning genre titles dont last long on the shelves thats a function of space not quality so idw has assembled a list of extraordinary books titles that represent the very best selections of the very best authors in science fiction robert silverbergs nightwings is a genuine must read for science fiction fans
8813447 we will not support any defense appropriations that do not include scaling back americas vast overseas empire of bases by at least 50
8813448 we will not support any legislation or regulation that employs federal blackmail to coerce the states into adopting mandated policies like reduced speed limits increased drinking ages or real id
8813449 i didnt even get my spikes off and i was called in to manager cito gastons office everything happens for a reason so well see what happens
8813450 hes a veteran he knows its that time of year so hes fine
8813451 i dont know what time it is we love playing basketball and i think our bodies kind of know what to do our defense was very solid and we pretty much picked up where we left off
8813452 honestly its weird because i came back and it was just like we played the other day
8813453 weve had many players not practicing if one player is just a little bit out of rhythm it really throws our systems off
8813454 football euphoria has been unleashed even among people who werent very interested in soccer before
8813455 playing in the bundesliga is like being a teenager invited to your older brothers party with girls for the first time
8813456 envy and hatred follows us wherever we go weve been voted germanys most unpopular club
8813457 a lot of people think a millionaire has injected a lot of money into the club and without that they wouldnt be where they are now
8813458 they have to prove themselves to earn respect its like the envy people have for rich new kids on the block
8813459 apart from bayern munich german clubs do not pay the wages needed to attract top flight players who mainly go to england
8813460 i talked to her and she nodded over and over and over again she wanted to leave
8813461 no athlete would like to have a life with only their eyes talking
8813462 so whats your beef brock you just confirmed the mccain claim
8813463 high resolution satellite imaging is moving from the black world of intelligence to the white world of commerce and tom clancys h a w x will bring that reality to gamers
8813464 with video game graphics becoming more realistic the use of high quality photographic ground textures in h a w x adds true photo realism to the air combat experience
8813465 we wanted to make sure they were at a full strength
8813466 they only had a week of practice which is not exactly what you had hoped to have had actually two days of practice thats not as though we had a full week
8813467 so now we have a chance to get everybody with a full week under their belt particularly coming off what they were coming off you dont want to overstress the muscles
8813468 they the bengals stuck with the plan to rest him
8813469 in so many ways its turned our business back into a singles business
8813470 this is our time to hold these leads and its our job were not getting it done right now
8813471 youve got five or six guys you could easily put out there with the women losing sharapova ivanovic and henin limits the automatics
8813472 i dont follow politics as much as maybe the rest of you guys do
8813473 the american guys they have to play on the big courts
8813474 im glad the change came early enough in preseason so that i could get acclimated to the position and get enough reps going into the regular season i have 100 percent confidence that i will get the job done this year it wasnt 100 percent for me i know im not where i need to be i know im not where i can be im not playing up to my potential yet but for having one week of practice with my hand in the dirt i felt good about it
8813475 we had 15 snaps scheduled so i think he was right on he did have a nice play on one particular sack
8813476 the whole purpose was to get him some feel and some playing time there particularly with the runs coming at him on first and second down
8813477 i am very proud of barack obama i believe in him and i believe he will do good things for this county i hope the country gives him that opportunity
8813478 i didnt know that was the date of kings speech
8813479 i am so focused on trying to win my match and obviously coming down from the olympics in beijing its been a whirlwind so ive been just pretty much focused on tennis
8813480 we are good enough friends so that we will probably go out to dinner after if we can
8813481 whoever loses might have to pick up the check or something but we are good enough friends that no matter who wins we will still be friends after the match
8813482 youve got five or six guys you could easily put out there with the women losing sharapova ivanovic and henin limits the automatics
8813483 i dont follow politics as much as maybe the rest of you guys do
8813484 the american guys they have to play on the big courts
8813485 i dont think ill join you this place looks shit
8813486 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8813487 there was something stirring across the country because of what happened in selma alabama because some folks are willing to march across a bridge so they got together and barack obama jr was born so dont tell me i dont have a claim on selma alabama dont tell me im not coming home to selma alabama
8813488 but we are as good as married there is no difference
8813489 ok lor in that case i shall tell everyone we are engaged
8813490 barack obama got a special deal from a convicted felon
8813491 i think it was a strange thing for barack obama to seize upon if homes is going to be the topic of discussio barack obama is going to end up on the short end of that one
8813492 i was just taking what was coming my way i dont think i played any different than i have all season
8813493 on a team like the olympic team you dont have to be so aggressive it will just come in terms of scoring it was just whoever got it got it
8813494 i obviously didnt get it as much as the others but thats cool i was more than happy to play my role
8813495 that hasnt stopped me before so im not exactly sure we cant continue to play like this and expect to have a chance to be in the playoffs
8813496 i thought it was the best weve played defensively and weve done a good job all year
8813497 we did some things out there that we didnt even talk about doing it was just great instinctual play by our players

8813523 mccain has said time and again that he doesnt understand the economy
8813524 on issues related to the vice presidency thats obviously sen mccains decision

8813529 if i look at the situation in the second quarter we would have to say it was more self inflicted
8813530 whenever youre restarting growth what i can tell you is its an imprecise process there were some parts of the business where we were probably too aggressive
8813531 when you look at their arsenal price is really their only weapon
8813532 now that obamapalooza is over and the opulent set is being taken down it is time to move on to the real business no matter how eloquent his speech his thin record his opposition to a real energy solution and his support of tax increases on those making as little as 42 000 per year will not resonate with minnesotans who are looking for a leader with the experience and judgment to lead our nation
8813533 franken snubbed from speaking at convention coleman featured in obama nomination video
8813534 im not saying i always vote democrat id vote for john mccain
8813535 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
8813536 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
8813537 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
8813538 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
8813539 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
8813540 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8813541 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8813542 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8813543 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8813544 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8813545 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8813546 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8813547 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8813548 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8813549 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8813550 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8813551 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8813552 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8813553 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8813554 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done

8813557 the plan was to get a couple of three and outs and then take the players out but it didnt turn out that way we didnt play well believe me if we could put our finger on it we would have done something about it before now weve got a little bit more time to get it right
8813558 we havent played well that is all you can say about it we have not made all the effort we need to play well all the things that go into playing well we havent done once we get all our guys going i feel we will have a very strong defense
8813559 there are a few things id like to change we got into a rhythm and i didnt want to come out of the game
8813560 hopefully in these next few days we can heal up
8813561 everyone knows were pretty banged up it will be nice to get some rest and get all our guys back and be 100 percent for dallas
8813562 we would have liked to have a touchdown on that first one which was a little upsetting
8813563 were running a very good campaign trying to put in place the policies detailed costed policies and the agenda that will take western australia forward and im pleased with that
8813564 i am sorry for what im about to say i apologize if i seem negative and difficult
8813565 hopefully getting past these barriers mentally and numbers wise we can put that in the past and become the organization were envisioned on becoming
8813566 we played all very good teams that are all in contention
8813567 i think it just goes back to a real simple formula if you dont pitch good you dont have a chance
8813568 the fortune 500 have overwhelmingly decided that including sexual orientation is in the best corporate interest and helps communicate corporate values to the estimated 660 billion annual domestic glbt consumer market
8813569 the history here thats not too impressive of a record
8813570 hopefully we can add on to that a little bit more
8813571 certainly not the way we drew it up the thing thats really painful for me and the staff is you want to give people a reason to believe
8813572 i feel like we let a lot of people down
8813573 i was proud of them it would have been easy to come here and not be ready to play
8813574 i dont know if ive ever been this nervous about an opening game weve always played well as the underdog but i was really concerned about having that top 25 ranking coming in here
8813575 kirbys been through some ups and downs we felt like he deserved the opportunity and we gave it to him
8813576 i thought griffin provided a spark which is what he has to do for us
8813577 if the united states had genuine broadband competition internet providers would not be able to profit from artificial scarcity they would invest in their networks to keep pace with consumer demand unfortunately americans will continue to face the consequences of this lack of competition until policymakers get serious about policies that deliver the world class networks consumers deserve
8813578 use bbc motion gallery clips to create a showreel or short film that can be used to represent great britain to the olympic athletes planning to come to the uk for the 2012 olympics
8813579 the winning entry was clearly a cut above the rest and would get any athlete coming to london for 2012 excited about the prospect of competing and spending time in the uk
8813580 for something put together from a purely creative point of view with no commercial experience this film hit the brief held the viewers attention and had momentum to the end
8813581 sanya is a promising talent her entry was well edited told a story and had a good pay off an essential part of any advertising campaign
8813582 what a great come from behind win just a great win i mean exciting
8813583 this place really got loud i dont know if it was the loudest ive heard it but let me tell you what it was loud
8813584 i mean ive been able to do that since i was in the minor leagues
8813585 ive always been able to drive in runs its something im proud of and i like to be in that situation late in the game
8813586 fontenot hit a homer and all of a sudden its a two run game and we got the top of our lineup coming soriano got on base and theriot got on base we got a good team
8813587 we shouldnt be going through this this is our time to hold these leads and its our job were not getting it done right now
8813588 yeah to think about how well cole threw the ball and how well our guys put at bats up against dempster its a tough one
8813589 that was a situation where we couldnt get people out actually the last game and most of the last games that weve lost thats kind of how its been
8813590 we know it wasnt their ones but youve still got to go out there and play and execute
8813591 we wanted to come out here and put together a couple of good drives and we were able to do that
8813592 you cant put too much stock in it and you cant take too much away from it either
8813593 its like last week playing against miami it looked like they blew us out we arent going to run around and think were kings of the world because we beat st louis tonight whoever is in front of you you want to do the best you can
8813594 im glad we did it because i think these guys deserved these extra snaps tonight linehan said
8813595 to give them close to a full games work gives us a lot more to look at we have some tough decisions to make and i think it will make it easier to give guys fair evaluations some guys helped themselves tonight
8813596 we would have liked to have started faster and not given up the scores
8813597 they sustained some good drives and ran the ball well what i was happy with was they settled down and stopped them the second half of the second quarter we played much better
8813598 we knew we werent as bad as we played last week it was good for us to get back out here and get some confidence heading into our game with the patriots
8813599 were fighting some demons the demons of the past the rascals that have hung around us for a year
8813600 every time we lose a game like tuesday is a reminder of that
8813601 now we have to play the mets head to head theyre must wins
8813602 its no secret were running out of time theres no margin for error
8813603 we have a lot of guys with short term memories
8813604 if you lose a game and you start dragging that around for the rest of the season youre gonna be in trouble were not thinking about september of 07
8813605 tapi sempat membuat saya tercengang kagum dan tidak berani untuk bermimpi bisa mendapatkan traffic seperti itu
8813606 this is a gutless cowardly way of telling people that theyre not going to have their health facility in a fully operational and full functional capacity
8813607 but we have got to not lay down on this i can assure the people of aramac and the surrounding district until theres blood on the floor i will not be letting up
8813608 there is no decision that has been taken to close the aramac hospital
8813609 the new ceo chief executive manager may from time to time put his or her head in the door of our hcc meetings where as the situation now is that we have our district manager patti hudson who attends all the meetings both for bundaberg and the north burnett

8813614 considering that companies rely on their it infrastructure to store and transmit sensitive company employee and customer data risky activities including the ones this survey reveals are of significant concern for all businesses
8813615 a single seemingly harmless activity such as using peer to peer networks while at work can breach the confidentiality and security of an entire corporate network including all of the documents data and internal communications that reside on that network on average at a company of 1 000 white collar employees up to 70 employees are likely using peer to peer file sharing while at work often or very often based on the survey findings companies and employees should be very concerned about their personal and corporate data in light of this information
8813616 this is the first time anyone has been prosecuted for modifying peer to peer software in this way and as such it highlights the fact that using p2p services and software is a dangerous hobby with potential legal consequences

8813625 if you are fundamentally unhappy with your life you will be more unhappy if you take this job so do us all a favor and get some treatment or move to the rockies but do not apply for employment with us

8813630 once while i was riding on a crowded bus the man sitting next to me threw his cell phone out the window when his phone rang instead of dutifully answering it he casually tossed it away i was stunned he looked at me shrugged and looked away i had no idea if it was his if it was stolen or if he even knew what a cell phone was but in one seemingly careless motion he managed to liberate himself from something that has completely consumed me
8813631 the question of blurred boundaries may become an irrelevant one for the next generation of workers spouses and parents because they cannot imagine life any other way
8813632 it seems the more connected we are the more detached we become

8813634 close to 50 percent of its customers send and receive more than 100 text messages a week
8813635 text messaging has made us a very impersonal society today theyre not communicating not using any facial expressions like smiling so when they get back into a situation where theyre talking to someone they dont smile
8813636 rather than face interpersonal dealings head on we can hide behind our phones until we can talk at our convenience or not talk at all
8813637 the iphone has a new application a gps navigational system called loopt if youre out and about and you want to know if your friends are in the neighborhood your phone can tell them where you are and theirs tells you where they are youre in the loop with technology like this its a wonder anyone has affairs anymore total information constant contact anytime all the time theres almost literally nowhere left to hide
8813638 some rebel groups have made 20 million per month selling coltan to industry buyers in some regions of the congo about 30 percent of schoolchildren are now forced to work in the mines

8813641 we are all going to have to rethink how we deal with the internet because there are all these competing values without any kind of editing function or gatekeeping function what does it mean to have the right to defend your reputation
8813642 anytime an individual or an institution or an invention leaps so far out ahead of that balance and throws a system whatever it might be political economic technological out of balance youve got a problem because then it can lead to the oppression of peoples rights it can lead to the manipulation of information it can lead to all kinds of bad outcomes which we have seen historically so were going to have to deal with that
8813643 allows an extraordinary amount of unregulated data and information to be located in one area and available to all the right wing has seized upon the internet as a means of communicating its ideas to people
8813644 the ironic part is that we were not utilizing the internet very well back then we did have a website called etruth com and it did get a high level of traffic i was always surprised that there were more people reading our stuff on the internet than were reading our newsletter but it still never occurred to me that it had all that much potential until the clintons connected the dots for me
8813645 when i saw that report i became convinced that the internet was the vehicle for keeping government under control because if these guys were so scared of it i felt we could do much more as journalists to utilize it
8813646 hey some are saying this might have been a mistake

8813651 our ice breaking research vessel polarstern is currently on a scientific mission in the arctic ocean departing from iceland the route has taken the ship through the northwest passage into the canadian basin where geophysical and geological studies will be carried out along profiles into the makarov basin to study the tectonic history and submarine geology of the central arctic ocean in addition oceanographic as well as biological studies will be carried out polarstern will circumnavigate the whole arctic ocean and exit through the northeast passage
8813652 the polar regions especially the arctic are very sensitive indicators of climate change the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change has shown that these regions are highly vulnerable to rising temperatures and predicted that the arctic would be virtually ice free in the summer months by 2070 other scientists claim it could become ice free as early as 2040 latest satellite observations suggest that the arctic could be mainly ice free even earlier
8813653 at awi we place particular emphasis on studying arctic sea ice and along with in situ studies of sea ice thickness change satellite data have been used extensively not only for the regular observation of changes in the arctic and antarctic but also for optimising the operation of polarstern in regions covered by sea ice

8813670 thursday night as he embarked on the final lap of his audacious bid to become the nations first black president
8813671 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8813672 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8813673 it was just a great feeling in a season full of some not so happy memories
8813674 it seems like two months since we won any series
8813675 thats one of the reasons we took him when you have a guy like that who can change the game its bigger than big
8813676 i was just using my speed and believing in it
8813677 that was really big for me going into the season it will be a big confidence maker for me
8813678 i dont know if i was disappointed so much as i was shocked
8813679 the guy doesnt miss field goals ive got a lot of confidence in this guy i think hes going to be just fine
8813680 i think my main repetitions have to come in practice mentally getting sharp and physically doing what i need to do
8813681 i dont feel like i needed to play anymore in the preseason than what i played
8813682 i think the writing is on the wall so be it
8813683 they pushed us around on the line of scrimmage pretty good
8813684 i dont know if theyre getting tired of me or not but im just trying to let them know that you cant be tired of me

8813688 obviously investor sentiment toward the u s equity market has been abysmal until recent weeks when theres been a shift to u s equities
8813689 valuations are pretty beaten down but the u s economy is likely to recover quicker than europe the u s seems like a pretty good bet right now
8813690 there are more outflows year to date than any previous year since we started tracking equity fund flows in 2000
8813691 we are still in first we still control what happens well be ok no one in here is worrying
8813692 you could sense we got a little bit too tight
8813693 weve been through several periods like that this year where we had to respond and we have
8813694 we have to go out there and win a ball game to start making us feel good

8813709 yesterday a report has been finalised that indicates there is this safety concern and thats why we moved overnight
8813710 i wasnt prepared to risk the safety of the public for one minute and thats why we put in place these barriers and thats why theyll be fenced off until weve actually sorted this out
8813711 it should have been constructed to appropriate standards so it didnt become a maintenance or safety liability for the broader community
8813712 i dont think that anyone in tasmania could place an accusation at the feet of this government over recent years of not supporting the pulp mill and not doing enough to get this project over the line and i would not accept any of that blame
8813713 we now have an opportunity to reassess how we use our forests and particularly to move forward and use our tasmanias forests for the magnificent carbon stores they are and use them to help solve the crisis of climate change
8813714 it is unfortunate that we have to create a business environment that does not look as though we are open for business due to a premier who looks very lukewarm on a 2 billion project

8813719 if school administrators feel there is no suitable alternative and are truly interested in the alleged career exploration benefits of the test they shouldnt be opposed to requiring parental consent and selecting option 8 to protect student privacy
8813720 with this sensitive data military recruiters can then tailor recruiting methods to individual students enabling the recruiters to mount a barrage of intimate and intimidating attacks on impressionable minors absent parental supervision
8813721 the army is touting this as a career exploration program and is hiding the fact that its a recruiting program
8813722 career counselors that ive talked to really havent known that its a military test
8813723 its really been one of those underground undercover ways that military recruiters have used to recruit
8813724 designed to encourage students to increase their level of self knowledge and to understand how that information could be linked to civilian and military occupational characteristics

8813727 theres no question that the military looks at our high schools as fertile recruiting ground for wars

8813773 barack obamas speech tonight laid out his specific bold solutions and optimistic vision for our nation and our childrens future
8813774 his speech crystallized the clear choice between he and senator mccain four more years of the same failed policies or a leader who can tackle the great challenges we face revitalizing our economy and restoring our standing in the world i am proud to support senator obama our next president of the united states and joe biden our next vice president of the united states
8813775 i have a dream today a dream deeply rooted in the american dream
8813776 when the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the constitution and the declaration of independence
8813777 especially this year a growing number of factors make for an uncertain income outlook for farmers
8813778 it will be rather difficult to achieve speedy growth in farm incomes
8813779 i couldnt make it out at first it wasnt until the wind blew that you could really see it is in a harness
8813780 there are goggles and it appears to be caught up in cables so presumably it is an airman
8813781 we are aware of the reports and we are looking at what can be done to identify the remains and establish whether they are of an australian and if they date back to the
8813782 its too early to speculate on the nationality of the airman or the circumstances of his death there were allied australian and american and japanese airmen who would have been flying over the area in the war
8813783 a number of allied aircraft had been reported as missing in the area in particular b25 mitchells and a number of
8813784 defence is still determining arrangements to mount an expedition to the site
8813785 is not recalling a product that it did not make and sell
8813786 they wouldnt be able to be in business if they did that
8813787 we are working with the supplier and cpsc and are directing store managers to remove product identified in the cpsc press release from store shelves and initiating a register block to prevent sale
8813788 in addition we are in the process of removing this product from sale at walmart com

8813794 we dont really know why the bottle failed and thats the key question for the investigation
8813795 sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurized contents
8813796 the preliminary report was a factual account of the incident and investigation to date
8813797 we do not intend to curtail peoples freedom or right to express themselves everyone is subjected to the law even websites and blogs
8813798 this is merely the first step in a comprehensive and reprehensible attempt to curb the access of conscientious malaysians to the internet
8813799 i didnt think that they would go ahead because their own charter guarantees no censorship
8813800 this is the first time they officially blocked my website

8813804 talking through the language of the bullet should be stopped
8813805 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it its a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create american jobs look out for american workers and play by the rules of the road i will make certain those health care companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws so that your pensions are protected ahead of ceo bonuses

8813814 we can relax now but please be cautious they might return soon
8813815 we are staging a protest because the government has made too many mistakes and has no legitimacy to run the country
8813816 from now on it will be stickier our political rallying will get stronger because more of our supporters from upcountry will come to help us we will not back down
8813817 we can withstand any difficult conditions if we can topple samak
8813818 if you leave the government house that means we have been defeated
8813819 they want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and do the coup again
8813820 but i defy you anywhere in the world to find me two italians as tight assed as the two italians we got and as for the brother well plutos not a planet anymore either
8813821 someone very dear to me has made another clerical error
8813822 i dont even like to think about it well sometimes i like to think about it
8813823 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8813824 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8813825 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8813826 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8813827 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8813828 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8813829 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent
8813830 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for
8813831 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8813832 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8813833 based on our discussions it was determined that it would probably be in dr paxtons best interest and the colleges best interest that he resign as president
8813834 i need a moment to catch my breath and try to get my life back together
8813835 i watched her all week she was being tortured every day
8813836 i told her she gave me my son back it was something i needed to say
8813837 i think you dont know what goes on in combat until you are in combat
8813838 i dont think they are going to put on a case in the future with a
8813839 after all this they are still my brothers i wish them the best
8813840 i still believe this case should have went before a military court for the simple fact that military jurors have an easier time understanding what happens in combat
8813841 i am looking forward to finally getting a chance at being home
8813842 when its not funny but its supposed to be well be the guys laughing and supporting you
8813843 its kind of hard to take everything and to understand the experience that ive had
8813844 hopefully as time goes on ill be able to sit down and really think about the opportunities ive had
8813845 i thought i ran out of time i messed up
8813846 but i was able to stay positive keep my goals in mind and push through to be in the best shape of my life and swim some of the fastest times in the olympics
8813847 bob perrys automatic checkbook raises the eyebrows of what used to be high rollers in texas
8813848 bob perry may be reclusive but his money speaks for him
8813849 he has a team of lobbyists that pursue the policy interests he wants in the state of texas
8813850 people would say hes the only individual who could afford his own state agency
8813851 they say his political donations actually resulted in the creation of the texas residential construction commission
8813852 it trcc has been a failure it really supports the home building industry and doesnt support consumers
8813853 millions of texans vote and millions of texans are donors
8813854 there isnt an opportunity for a single person to have the impact
8813855 bob perry spends every day trying to better society through charitable concerns and certainly helping to create a better government
8813856 when bob perrys checkbook drowns out the voices of other texans we lose our voice
8813857 how much you could tell us about your top contributor bob perry
8813858 well what i can tell you about bob perry is that ive met few people in this country who care more about the country and state they live in and about ensuring the integrity of the state and of its legal system
8813859 i can also tell you bob perry has never asked me for anything
8813860 bob perry is a legendary texas entrepreneur he has a long record of participation in the political process on the national and state levels he has a strong belief in good solid conservative government
8813861 you know for a place in the fourth round of the biggest tournament of the year
8813862 i think well probably put our friendship aside for a couple of hours
8813863 its great were close enough friends that no matter what happens were going to be friends afterwards
8813864 if im not going to win i certainly love for him to win and do well but i dont want to lose if that answers your question
8813865 have done an incredible job with the pressure theyve got i dont feel as much pressure as those guys to go deep in grand slams obviously i want to and you know im trying my hardest
8813866 ive got a pretty big hurdle at the moment with james id like to think that he does as well
8813867 pressure is a synonym for opportunity without any pressure youre probably doing something a lot of people dont care about or youre doing something thats easy nothing im doing out there is easy and im proud to be in that position of having pressure
8813868 your computer screen is a window on the world with this tour of some of earths most exquisite vistas from the mud houses of the sahara to the opera house at sydney
8813869 i dont know in what fashion or how many innings or how many pitches or what have you
8813870 well talk about september call ups i cant tell you if phil hughes is going to be here or not before the seasons out that has not been determined but he pitched much better
8813871 snow takes full advantage of his films system of discourse to twit restless audiences a lot of this is pretty funny but so is this is more than a series of gags snow manages to defamiliarize both film and language creating a kind of moving concrete poetry while throwing a monkey wrench into a theoretical debate is film a language that has been going on sporadically for 60 years if you let it snows film stretches your definition of what film is thats cinema and so is this
8813872 a silent film of 45 minutes consisting of single words of this script or score placed on the screen one by one one after another for specific lengths of time several different strategies were employed on timing words passages of the film image quality changes too and the situation of an audience reading a film is a special one not to be duplicated by reading this
8813873 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8813874 if anything youre starting to see the necessity of why you have to get younger weve had some injuries theres no doubt about it but weve got some key guys who havent performed like theyre capable of is that because of age
8813875 obviously as weve seen this year you cant have enough pitching
8813876 ultimately what i feel is a strong reluctance to trade three or four assets to another team for a player and then sign him to a multiyear contract you trade for a guy give up three or four assets and then pay him then youve crushed your payroll and your assets at the same time
8813877 if you choose to play in that marketplace the one thing youd be sacrificing is a draft pick
8813878 were very protective of our draft picks but for the right player and the right circumstance ive always said were still big game hunters
8813879 but when we held on to a guy like that you dont do it and say ok in the next four months hes got to do x hes got five years whatever it is to show why you bet on someone like that
8813880 what you did to our daughter is inexcusable at her softball games you could look her dad and i in the eye speak to us all the while knowing what you were planning on doing unconscionable
8813881 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8813882 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush

8813885 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8813886 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8813887 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8813888 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8813889 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8813890 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8813891 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience

8813895 everyone is focusing on japan as the big team in the group but i know uzbekistan from before when he was the south korea national coach they were the first team to qualify for this round so there is no reason to underestimate them
8813896 they play a russian style of football physically strong skilful with good organisation and the fans will be very fanatic
8813897 it is an interesting challenge it can help qualification if we can get a good result over there but it wont be easy

8813906 i feel that the background score composed by taufique in the film is fabulous it is very kashmiri and soothing to hear and you dont feel that an orchestra comprising 50 musicians is used to compose the music of the film

8813915 we have a lot of good players out here and it made my job a lot easier
8813916 hes been working there some throughout camp but hasnt gotten very many reps
8813917 he does have very good short area quickness and the ability to react
8813918 i understood why he didnt want to play the starters
8813919 it was understandable sure i wanted to play but it wasnt a big deal i never really brought it up
8813920 we could wind up maybe with some non traditional numbers but well do whats best for us when looking over a 16 game season

8813940 i am the bread of life he who comes to me will never go hungry and he who believes in me will never be thirsty 36but as i told you you have seen me and still you do not believe 37all that the father gives me will come to me and whoever comes to me i will never drive away
8813941 i dont care if youre so scared you foul your breeches and i dont care if a thousand wildlings are coming over the walls howling for your blood you get those birds off or i swear ill hunt you through all seven hells and make you damn sorry that you didnt
8813942 id put my money on the sun and solar energy what a source of power
8813943 i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that
8813944 i thought the first team guys did we got the ball and drove it down twice we should have had a touchdown the first time but settled for a field goal defensively we were able to get a turnover and basically held them to zero points we started putting the backups in and they started making some mistakes we gave them 10 points to go into the half at 10 10 in the second half we didnt do nearly as well as we needed to do but we were playing with the down the line guys
8813945 he played much better tonight he looked more like a quarterback that you would expect a quarterback to look like tonight i thought he managed his team drove them down for two scores and he was eager and wanted to play some more i told him he was going to sit with me after the first two series they all wanted to sit with me they knew that this was the last preseason game and now it starts counting
8813946 he had a good night he was trying to take advantage of the opportunity given to him so you have to applaud him for that
8813947 im glad its over we just had too many injuries during the course of the preseason and now we have to see if we can get these guys back because dallas is coming to town
8813948 we didnt really play a team like that necessarily last year its going to be a great challenge for us and theyre going to get a lot of hype because theyre a great team both on defense and offense its going to take a great effort for us to win the game
8813949 the expectations have risen now after my rookie year and none greater than from myself im really hoping and working hard on having a better year than last year its just the way i am and as offensive linemen thats just the way we are we worry about the game ahead of us and work hard on the things we need to improve on
8813950 i felt pretty good there are a few things i would like to change but aside from that we were able to get into a rhythm i didnt want to come out of the game because we were on a roll and i wanted to put more points up on the board
8813951 like anything else with more experience youre able to grasp a better knowledge for the game it was easier to adapt to different wide receivers and tight ends
8813952 yes we are excited to get the season going at this point in time our focus is on dallas over the next week
8813953 we were in a little cover three and i tried to play it i tried to bait them a little bit he ended up throwing it right before he got hit by our defensive line i think dl robaire smith hit him and disrupted his throw and it ended up in my hands
8813954 im just glad its over it has been a long training camp im ready to get these practice games out of the way and start the real season
8813955 we worked hard and we did a lot of things better than last year that shows a lot of promise the offense moved the ball well i feel great about going in and beating the cowboys next week
8813956 we came out of the gates early which is something that we werent able to do last week and the week before that were headed in the right direction its the end of preseason and we can go out and fix the mistakes we made we have a couple days before we start our preparation for dallas we need to get these guys some rest so we can come out and hit this thing full speed
8813957 we could have done better but we made progress from last week thats probably the most important thing we have a couple days off so some guys can get some rest
8813958 it was an alright performance but obviously we wanted to come out with a victory and end the preseason with a win the offense showed signs of executing the small things we have been working on at camp it feels good to get the opportunity because that is what you want i think i made the most of my opportunities except for the one i dropped on the sidelines
8813959 ste es un c ncer que se ha venido incubando durante a os y al que no se le dio la debida atenci n pero es un c ncer que vamos a erradicar
8813960 its one of the few shows on air that has real men
8813961 theres a lot of shows recently on network television about p ssies essentially guys dont relate to them and women dont want to watch them and this is a show about real guys and i think that a lot of people like that in the true heroic sense they really like the characters in this show
8813962 there will be others and this is more important to me

8813977 the chief need of our communion at the moment was the rebuilding of relationships the rebuilding of trust in one another and of confidence in our anglican identity how far the intensified sense of belonging together will help mutual restraint in such matters remains to be seen but it can be said that few of those who attended left without feeling they had in some respects moved and changed
8813978 to have it be on the third anniversary of katrina if you wrote it in a script or in a book you wouldnt believe it
8813979 barack obama showed ohio and the nation tonight why he is the best choice to be americas next president his plan to grow the economy and create new jobs is exactly the approach we need for ohio sen obama will be a president who stands up for ohioans and puts our families first tonight we saw that ohios future lies with barack obama not four more years of the same failed bush policies under john mccain
8813980 i thought it was one of the best speeches ive ever heard
8813981 reminded us of the role we must play in the world and of our commitment to each other
8813982 the messages of hope and that american can change from the way it has been was demandingly given
8813983 he talked to peoples hearts he didnt just talk to democrats and republicans he talked to the whole world
8813984 what we should be doing if we had the vision to do it
8813985 it was apparent obama wanted to use his moment in history so voters knew there was a distinct difference between more of the same and true change
8813986 why why do you not take me outside i long to be outside
8813987 why why do you bring me out to this dewy grass when you know that i dont like it
8813988 hmmm i dont know whats up with it theres nothing i can do
8813989 well thats a separate company we cant help you here

8813993 especially in this economy money is very tight and so were really looking forward to providing a service for people and providing them with parking but also raising funds for our school which is very much needed funds
8813994 some are talking about going higher than that later on when the event starts getting closer weve already had two parkers at 100
8813995 what a deal it helps kids and public school and you know great
8813996 this is the greatest part of the united states right here
8813997 a clairement montr le choix qui existe entre lui et le s nateur mccain quatre ans de plus de la m me politique inefficace ou un dirigeant qui peut relever les grands d fis revitaliser notre conomie et restaurer notre prestige dans le monde je suis fi re de soutenir le s nateur obama
8813998 nous sommes un de ces moments uniques un moment o notre nation est en guerre notre conomie dans la tourmente et le r ve am ricain est nouveau menac

8814000 si on travaille dur et que lon fait des sacrifices chacun dentre nous peut atteindre son r ve et au del se rassembler dans la grande famille am ricaine pour sassurer que la prochaine g n ration pourra son tour poursuivre ce r ve
8814001 en tant que commandant en chef je nh siterai jamais d fendre ce pays mais jenverrai nos soldats risquer leur vie seulement pour une mission claire et avec lengagement sacr quils auront tout l quipement n cessaire pour combattre et quils b n ficieront des soins et des aides quils m ritent quand ils rentreront
8814002 le m me parti qui vous a apport deux mandats de george bush et son vice pr sident dick cheney va demander ce pays un troisi me mandat
8814003 et nous sommes ici parce que nous aimons trop ce pays pour laisser les quatre prochaines ann es ressembler aux huit derni res
8814004 le bilan est clair john mccain a vot au congr s avec george bush 90 du temps
8814005 le s nateur mccain aime bien parler de jugement mais vraiment que votre jugement veut dire lorsque vous pensez que george bush avait raison plus de 90
8814006 je ne pense pas que le s nateur mccain se moque de ce qui se passe dans la vie des am ricains je pense simplement quil ne le sait pas
8814007 je sais bien que je suis un candidat improbable je nai pas le pedigree id al je nai pas pass ma carri re dans les all es du pouvoir
8814008 given that weve got one week before school starts this looks to be the best solution going into this school year
8814009 the spirit in which we want to negotiate is that no one is worse off under the arrangement than was planned before
8814010 that was not done in this case thats very unfortunate and thats not the way the school district wishes to conduct itself
8814011 we where tired of getting yelled at all the time
8814012 we didnt think they would think a teacher would do it we are so sorry to miss romonison she should not be in trouble for something we did we wont do it no more
8814013 there were a couple of the jurors who had decided already that she must be guilty because she was arrested and it was in all the news
8814014 i believe in the interest of justice that a new trial should be granted
8814015 i believe the verdict at trial would have been different
8814016 if this were the standard all you would need would be someone writing an anonymous note to the judge or the defense attorney to get a new trial
8814017 safety is the number one concern for every single parent
8814018 we know there are significant incidents happening in our schools on a regular basis that are frightening for parents families and students themselves
8814019 parents shouldnt be too shocked by these numbers because theyre just a better reflection of the truth
8814020 theyre moving to address this theyre moving in the right direction
8814021 we have said if a crime is committed if violence occurs we want that directly reported to the philadelphia police department to school police
8814022 some of those schools are still doing a good job for some kids
8814023 persistently dangerous is a hard label for a school to shed and its a diagnosis that has to lead to a treatment

8814035 barack as a candidate was unlike any other candidate i had seen in american politics
8814036 the campaign was from the start totally based on grassroots organizing and building an organization from the bottom up
8814037 i didnt feel like i was necessarily in sync with a lot of people i was around
8814038 they said it was because of him doing it instead of his parents calling that they wanted someone like him at their school and they were going to give him the financial aid
8814039 it was a little sad because we southern people dont send our children away to school very much thats what he wanted to do and it was a very good thing for him to do
8814040 it started out pretty close to the same thing it is now to make it easier for people to share information about themselves to learn what their friends and peers are doing
8814041 it so happened it was something a lot of people wanted and needed over the course of that winter and spring it just ballooned it was clear a lot of people were interested to find a more efficient way to find out what friends were doing
8814042 when you talk to barack about his issues or experiences he is clearly in touch with the lives of everyday people
8814043 we are very much for obama even if our child wasnt working for him i think we would be

8814072 somos melhores de que estes ltimos oito anos somos um pa s melhor de que isso
8814073 eu n o sei o que voc s acham mas eu n o estou pronto para dar 10 de chance mudan a
8814074 n o acho que o senador mccain n o se importe com o que acontece na vida dos americanos penso simplesmente que ele n o faz id ia sen o porque definiria a classe m dia como os que ganham menos de cinco milh es de d lares por ano
8814075 estamos aqui pelo pr ximo presidente dos estados unidos barack obama
8814076 quando estivermos na casa branca faremos com que voc s todos sejam ouvidos
8814077 nossa credibilidade internacional est no ponto mais alto de todos os tempos precisamos recuperar nossa autoridade global muitas pessoas no poder falharam hora de substituir nossas lideran as
8814078 acho que obama tem a energia necess ria para liderar
8814079 sim n s podemos ter um presidente que nos inspire a acreditar em mudan a
8814080 um dos maiores presentes da nossa democracia a oportunidade que temos a cada quatro anos de mudar de dire o n o garantia apenas uma oportunidade a pergunta simples vamos aproveitar essa oportunidade para mudar
8814081 h oito anos alguns diziam que n o havia muita diferen a entre os dois candidatos dos dois grandes partidos e que pouco importava quem seria o presidente hoje duvido que algu m diga isso
8814082 estamos hoje basicamente diante da mesma escolha que em 2000
8814083 se voc s gostam da pol tica de bush votem em mccain se voc s querem mudan a votem em obama
8814084 sonho que meus quatro filhos viver o um dia em um pa s onde n o ser o julgados pela cor de sua pele
8814085 a elei o de barack obama ser um passo crucial na materializa o desse sonho
8814086 mas o que ocorrer esta noite n o o final do caminho nem o princ pio a continua o de uma luta que come ou h s culos
8814087 foi eleito um candidato n o pela cor de sua pele mas pelo seu car ter
8814088 pouco antes de subir no palco pensei em como meu pai teria ficado orgulhoso orgulhoso de barack obama orgulhoso do partido que o designou e orgulhoso da am rica que vai eleg lo
8814089 h exatamente 45 anos meu pai estava em washington diante do monumento dedicado a lincoln o presidente que aboliu a escravid o nos estados unidos e proclamou eu tenho um sonho que um dia esta na o se levantar e viver o verdadeiro significado de sua cren a
8814090 somos todos filhos deste sonho e ele king est presente em nossos cora es e em nossas mentes ele vive em nossas esperan as e nossos sonhos na compet ncia e na coragem na postura e na tranq ilidade de barack obama
8814091 vamos ter um presidente que dar a devida aten o am rica latina e ao m xico
8814092 i think that the historical analogies are pretty appropriate here
8814093 pode haver corte de vagas melhoria da forma o do corpo docente pessoal mais titulado com melhor titula o necessidade de rever quando for o caso os conv nios estabelecidos com os hospitais
8814094 temos de abrir as portas da universidade mas n s temos que fazer um nivelamento quando aluno entra e temos de cuidar para que o aluno aprenda os pr requisitos m nimos para a sua profissionaliza o
8814095 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson
8814096 sir im not calling you a liar im just saying i took your battery out and warter poured out so yes your phone does have water damage
8814097 now of course to judge convention speeches i always turn to bill kristol monday night he said this about michelle obamas speech
8814098 amp as for senator clintons praise for barack obama heres how kriristol described that
8814099 generic could have been drunk newsplied to any oar democrat
8814100 ele est se recuperando bem mas teve muita sorte deve ter perdido uma das vidas depois disso
8814101 are is no better example than a climate crisis as i have said for many years throughout this l amp were borrowing money from china to restore americas greatness fight for smarter government that trusts a market but protects us against its excesses enact policies that are pro education amp pro family establish a foreign policy that is smart as well as strong provide health care for all amp solutions for a climate crisis
8814102 a century amp a half ago when america faced our greatest trial a end of one era gave way to a birth of anoar a c amp idate who emerged victorious in that election is now regarded by most historians as our greatest president before he entered a white house abraham lincolns experience in elective office consisted of eight years in his state legislature in springfield illinois amp one term in congress during which he showed a courage amp wisdom to oppose a invasion of anoar country that was popular when it started but later condemned by history
8814103 shared a belief that in america air son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8814104 it is that promise that has always set this country drunk newsart that through hard work amp sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come togear as one american family to ensure that a next generation can pursue air dreams as well
8814105 thats why i st amp here tonight because for two hundred amp thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men amp women students amp soldiers farmers amp teachers nurses amp janitors found a courage to keep it alive
8814106 ase challenges are not all of governments making but a failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington amp a failed policies of george w bush
8814107 america we are better than ase last eight years we are a better country than this
8814108 amp as we walk we must make a pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8814109 publication on or by way of stored video or images on a website or internet server is prohibited
8814110 because mrs garcia kept the message weve been able to trace the electronic signature on the email to his internet service provider and get this the provider is only six blocks away from the police station
8814111 the suspect is a professional website designer he fits the profile of someone who could easily create a spoof site of the bank
8814112 this had to be done due to an inordinate amount of traffic that was saturating your network connection and causing your server to become unstable just instituting that simple htaccess rule cut the bandwidth consumption of your server to 15 of what it was previously
8814113 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8814114 not with so much work to be done at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future
8814115 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8814116 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8814117 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less
8814118 more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8814119 next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third and we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8814120 mr mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time
8814121 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8814122 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because john mccain a man who earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
8814123 pennsylvania is now much harder for john mccain to win because of those registrations
8814124 this election is in your hands not mine not anyone on the campaign staff not the pundits not the democratic party you need to own this campaign
8814125 i feel so full and excited to be experiencing history
8814126 you just have to pinch yourself i didnt think this would happen in my lifetime
8814127 every morning when i wake up and every night when i go to bed this is on my mind
8814128 on more than one occasion ive been moved to tears
8814129 he wasnt just speaking to african amercians or women he was speaking to people of all echelons
8814130 people never ever thought that this would ever happen we are on the brink of something great
8814131 that was unbelievable i wish my father was alive to see this
8814132 look i was watching him give a speech on television a year ago in selma ala where my grandmother lived and i was blown away
8814133 my grandparents had been activists in the civil rights movement with ralph abernathy and martin luther king jr and had gone through so much trying to help blacks get the right to vote my grandmother told me too she never thought shed live to see the day when an african american could become president and told me i needed to get involved
8814134 it was an amazing experience living in a swing state during an election like this
8814135 and seeing how well received we were as obama volunteers
8814136 when we turned those signatures in we all said to each other we had a feeling that this primary campaign is going to come down to pennsylvania and lo and behold now three months later it looks like the general election is going to come down to pennsylvania as well
8814137 i turned to my wife and said one day that man is going to be president
8814138 when you sign up to be a soldier youre given a mission and you go ahead and execute it
8814139 and saw just this sea of signs there was so much energy there and on the streets of denver which can be pretty quiet on a sunday night
8814140 the last time i was at invesco i watched the steelers play the broncos
8814141 all i can say is that its great that on my last day in this country im going to see sen obama become the democratic presidential nominee there
8814142 i thought how could a guy operating under this kind of pressure three hours of sleep a night produce that kind of speech
8814143 enormous ability to arouse the intense admiration and affection of his base
8814144 exactly what he means by change hope and transformation all the sort of big payoff words that appear in his speeches he has yet to clearly define
8814145 one of the dangers here is that in the effort to constantly adjust his position people then begin to wonder where his bottom line is
8814146 hes got to show that hes got a bottom line and that hes willing to fight for it
8814147 ive been in meetings with at least three different presidents
8814148 he wasnt just up to the level he was superior
8814149 obama met with the palestinians some came up afterward and were saying that they were so impressed because here was obama who had the same facility the same grasp of the issues as clinton did
8814150 and clinton had been president for a few years by the time he met with them
8814151 no question that he was a liberal as were most editors of the review and most students at harvard law at that time
8814152 but he wasnt the kind who demonized conservatives or personalized politics

8814243 in the near term turkey will face difficult policy choices in reconciling the country s russian and western interests
8814244 in my first year as president i have lived up to the oath of office
8814245 i m aware of my duties and position as president
8814246 impartiality is very important for me and i believe that i maintained my impartiality during my first year in office i included all citizens and opened the presidential palace s doors to everyone
8814247 we need to concentrate our energy in the international area
8814248 i believe that over the next few years turkey will become the most dependable country in the region
8814249 turkey maintains its stance regarding the cyprus issue and supports a comprehensive solution
8814250 nearly all political parties have expressed the need for a new constitution but the most important thing on this issue is to reach a broad based consensus
8814251 turkey is completely applying the provisions of montreux agreement there are no developments in the black sea in violation of the agreement
8814252 of course there are some who aren t happy about the restrictions under the agreement but it is very important for turkey the black sea is the most stable sea in the region
8814253 the tsk will continue to defend the republic s basic principles
8814254 i respect the will of the people of south ossetia and abkhazia
8814255 no people should be left to live under the yoke of any other country
8814256 this should be clearly understood the turkish cypriots have experienced the same things it was turkey which helped and recognized us the turkish cypriots have shown many times our determination not to live under the yoke of the greek cypriots which attacked us for this reason i understand very well the people of south ossetia and abkhazia and respect them
8814257 ive spoken to ian and i dont buy that comment
8814258 ive heard nothing from nick i have not been given any indication which direction hes going with his picks i have no clue what hes doing to do
8814259 its a difficult situation because if he was playing gleneagles this week he would basically give up his chance of winning the fedex cup
8814260 today i felt nervous at the beginning and then it went away
8814261 i am not thinking about anything right now just enjoying the moment
8814262 this is very disappointing to me but something i have to accept
8814263 she played a lot better than i expected she served very well
8814264 i did well i had to come back in third set from down 3 0 in games so i am happy with the victory
8814265 i am happy to be in the third round for me this is a very important tournament
8814266 he is a good player i am going to have to play better to beat him
8814267 not too many long rallies but i am serving well
8814268 i better be ready that girl is a tough cookie
8814269 all member states including russia should respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other states
8814270 they are quite concerned about such developments these concerns should be taken into consideration
8814271 the measures to be taken against such formation can only succeed if this social reality is analyzed in an accurate way
8814272 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8814273 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8814274 he has remarkable ability to inspire people to raise our hopes and rally us to high purpose
8814275 we face and what we need to do to solve them
8814276 nothing about electing barack obama as the next president of the united states is going to be easy
8814277 people who deal with africa become rich and africa remains poor
8814278 its important that profits for outside corporations translate into benefits for africans
8814279 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
8814280 appropriate and secures an important constitutional right and such decision should not be overturned
8814281 if i become president i will lower taxes for hard working families and i will not give tax breaks to companys that send workers over seas
8814282 for over two decades hes mccain subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
8814283 why mccain is right on russia and right on health care
8814284 al gore is a remarkable figure im not sure why he blew his chance he did get half a million more votes of course in a popular election than the man who eventually became president by the supreme court decision
8814285 what we saw last night was hillary clinton herself putting obama over the top and many of these delegates who vowed never to vote for obama publicly came to jesus so to speak and said they were going to vote for obama now
8814286 i think its important he pick someone hes comfortable with and you know theres rumors hes talking about mitt romney that would scare pause as if he was trying to avoid dropping an s bomb the devil out of me i just dont think he likes mitt romney you gotta live with this guy
8814287 barack obama has really catapulted america into its 21st century multicultural future whether americans are ready for it or not
8814288 over and over he talked about common ground on issues that have been so divisive abortion gun control gay rights and implicit in all this is the search for a more civil more workable if you will kind of government
8814289 did acknowledge the desire for common ground there for reasonable not the traditional knee jerk liberal position on them
8814290 i think its going to be a very powerful help to his campaign
8814291 our strength is not in our money or our military or even in our culture
8814292 its the american spirit the american promise that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain that binds us together in spite of our differences that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen but what is unseen that better place around the bend that is america
8814293 if this is an ownership society you own your failure
8814294 if your gonna follow bin laden to the gates of hell how about going to his cave and getting him

8814391 four of the group then confronted the 16 year old male inside the house and forced him into a car police said
8814392 it is also alleged the author of the website forum was encouraging people to kill and bash the 17 year old const young said in a statement
8814393 any sort of bullying whether it be in the playground or over a computer is not acceptable and we take these matters very seriously he said
8814394 i urge all victims to tell your teachers tell your parents or to contact police
8814395 four of the group then confronted the 16 year old male inside the house and forced him into a car police said
8814396 we believe that the 12 executions were an isolated incident and not part of a strategy to destabilise the state guzman told reporters
8814397 im getting on a bit while ive seen people tasered im probably reluctant to do it myself
8814398 if were prepared to use this on members of the public when we have to its only right and proper that the head of the organisation tries it out for himself
8814399 i think its a bit hypocritical when the police have been saying for months that the taser is safe and only has short term effects that the police commissioner himself is scared of being tasered
8814400 they are two teams who are both on the rise and they will provide a good measure of where we are at in our own development
8814401 purists are not going to like this and not everyone is going to like it
8814402 we are going to do our best to do it quickly and accurately
8814403 that is how many weve had so far and it will vary from year to year
8814404 when we come back with a ruling from video replay there is no argument unless it involves spectator interference and then the manager is entitled to an explanation
8814405 were only talking about home runs balls were not talking about plays at third base or balls and strikes or any of those things were just talking about a select portion of the game
8814406 sometimes with the configurations of these ballparks and so forth it makes it tough
8814407 im a throwback old baseball guy and i like the way that baseball is played and i like the part where the umpires decision held up and at the same time it didnt mean that they dont miss them and they dont get them right thats part of it
8814408 i think instant replay will definitely help that but i think it will take a little bit longer in the game and every year we go to spring training and the season starts and they always talk to us about shortening the time of the game
8814409 if they have to do a replay youre standing out there for five minutes doing nothing
8814410 they want to speed the game up make the call
8814411 the way they are building them now with all the angles its tougher to see what is going on
8814412 it doesnt really matter either way for me i hope it doesnt distract anything i hope they get the calls right
8814413 ive played the same way ive played throughout the year
8814414 i just havent been scoring the way i would like even though i feel like im playing better the little shots around the greens have cost me but im starting to get that turned around and i expect to have a much better week
8814415 it was a fun tournament last year and i loved the opportunity to have won the tournament
8814416 but i also love the way it happened with the opportunity to play three rounds with tiger
8814417 id be making half as much as i am now
8814418 im very thankful hes in our sport and hes had the success and the charisma and the lure to attract corporate america as well as fans to the game
8814419 you know that right you are playing left handed this week arent you
8814420 the key is going to be again scoring getting up and down around the greens that i miss and getting those birdie putts to drop
8814421 i was really happy with how i responded to the challenge of losing the first ride in the final
8814422 tara is a really strong racer and she used her abilities perfectly it was a very tactical final and i had to really keep focused and not deviate from my plan
8814423 im still gaining more and more experience at the national and international level
8814424 its going to take time to climb the international rankings to be where i want to be but my plan is to be in the mix in 2012
8814425 the goal of the event is to bring forth the realities and economics of mobile media educate the investment community and to create a forum for emerging growth mobile media companies to connect with other key players in the mobile ecosystem

8814427 i am truly excited that julie agreed to come to arkansas state and our volleyball program
8814428 she brings with her a wealth of experience from the big east conference training the setters and coordinating the offense at georgetown university during the last couple of seasons with some very talented candidates in the pool julie stood out as the best allowing our program to take advantage of her experience and expertise and help us climb back to the top of the sun belt conference
8814429 in view of its size it is most likely that it was either from the side of a cake or from the top of a single tier cake a highly unusual and probably inedible collectors item
8814430 i was so very touched by all the lovely bottles that were in my christmas bag today thank you both a million times for thinking of me 1990 was the year that we met at last amp how wonderful our friendship was amp is been with special thanks amp fondest love to you both
8814431 for three years now were been reporting annually giving parents access to our performance for the year that performance against a five year average and a state average as well as comparisons with like school groups
8814432 we already have mandatory reporting in all public schools and any member of the public can get those reports over the counter
8814433 they give detail on the programs being run in the school marks achieved growth rate and performance
8814434 we also provided written reports twice a year with parent interviews and those reports are extremely detailed
8814435 good schools that are doing the right thing would be very comfortable with the federal governments proposal
8814436 it is simply an amazing experience to be doing completely ordinary things in an extraordinary place
8814437 it is interesting to do a land based deployment i went to the solomon islands on board hmas manoora in 2000 but to actually live in a country for an extended period provides a totally different perspective
8814438 i enjoy hearing the muslim call to prayer from a nearby mosque even the 48 degree days and the american food at the cafeteria remind me that im somewhere very different
8814439 im also getting a much clearer view of all that australia has done and is still doing to help the people of both iraq and afghanistan rebuild their countries
8814440 ive already missed my mothers and one of my sisters birthday and will miss my fathers too
8814441 i miss being able to play with my dog eat fresh food and enjoy a glass of wine but what were doing here is important and i have no regrets
8814442 sixty thousand flying hours in the seahawks without the loss of an aircraft is remarkable
8814443 i joined the navy in 1960 and have been flying at albatross since 1967
8814444 its amazing because the life expectancy in a flying career is not as long as mine has been
8814445 but i am still here and i am still flying to still be flying at 63 in a front line squadron amazes me
8814446 the navy has changed over the years but some things dont change
8814447 you dont realise about this country you dont do anything for the country shouted demonstrators singing protest songs as a further 300 police took up positions in nearby rajadoemneon avenue
8814448 they wont allow us to send a new group of police lieutenant general akerach meepreecha of metropolitan police said

8814450 lance corporal marks was killed conducting a combat operation in an extremely demanding environment
8814451 a thorough inquiry was undertaken into his death the inquiry officer looked at equipment training the operational situation and available support on the day of the incident to ascertain if there was anything that could have been done to prevent lance corporal markss death
8814452 ive lived here for 70 years but never experienced anything like this before a man told public broadcaster nhk
8814453 you could call it a guerrilla downpour it just lashed down suddenly
8814454 she had a feeble back and legs and was living alone i guess she had trouble running away a worried neighbour told nhk
8814455 ive lived here for 70 years but never experienced anything like this before a man told public broadcaster nhk
8814456 america we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future
8814457 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8814458 you know john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8814459 end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaida and the taliban in afghanistan
8814460 build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease
8814461 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8814462 i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
8814463 dear chessmoso just recently two top filipino grandmasters had a showdown with a reported p200 000 as prize money offered by the sponsors i was eagerly waiting for the result of the seven game confrontation which to my dismay ended in a draw what left a bad taste to my gin and tonic watered mouth was that the two who tied on the sixth game did not play the tiebreak seventh game but instead decided by themselves to divide the pot money i find this to be beggarly and highly impolite for the gms to do it is like pacquaio and de la hoya stopping at the 10th round of a scheduled 12 rounds and deciding to call it a draw after being informed by the judges that both have the same scores are the actions of the two gms allowed in chess tournaments if so the people who drafted the rules should be made to swallow the chess pieces of that tournament and add the board as dessert the tournament was supposed to be a showdown on who is the master of whom
8814464 why else would he define middle class as someone making under 5 million a year
8814465 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy
8814466 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich
8814467 if youre just talking about income how about 5 million
8814468 when john mccain said we could just muddle through in afghanistan i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9 11 and made clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights
8814469 afghanistan is dicey i think there are certain areas of the country particularly along the pakistani border that are clearly not under the control of either pakistan or the afghan government
8814470 i am concerned about it but im not as concerned as i am about iraq today obviously or i would be talking about afghanistan but i believe if president hamid karzai can make the progress that he is making that in the long term we may muddle through it in afghanistan
8814471 and when one of his chief advisers the man who wrote his economic plan was talking about the anxiety americans are feeling he said that we were just suffering from a mental recession and that weve become and i quote a nation of whiners
8814472 phil gramm does not speak for me i speak for me
8814473 how else could he offer a plan that would privatize social security and gamble your retirement
8814474 this election has never been about me its about you
8814475 its a moment in our history that well never forget
8814476 most times people are offering thousands of dollars to get out of politicians speeches
8814477 i did request to be on a line with sean avery who i am very sorry that the rangers lost
8814478 i seem to be slowing down a little bit well see what happens
8814479 its always fun though i dont think theres anyone going to try laying anyone out
8814480 its never easy to participate in such big events and one has to play consistently to make an impact here
8814481 the enneagram a private session with the worlds greatest psychologist
8814482 in my last book the beautiful life i outlined the deep and open ended truths which lie beneath all traditions the assumption here was that we are one and that a unity of understanding is possible in this new book in the company of the enneagram i consider personal and particular truth the assumption here is that we are different and need an individual hearing this is why its a private session the two books go hand in hand we are one and we are different in the meantime its an interesting question just who was the worlds greatest psychologist
8814483 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8814484 obomber and he favored a left hand double pump shot hes left handed
8814485 rosie the riveter at a boeing co plant in wichita kan during world war ii
8814486 no he didnt he didnt even go in your yard
8814487 thats because your cat ran he should have stayed where he was your cat is teasing my dog
8814488 what your dog was running at him like a bat out of hell

8814493 the superintendent has not brought us back what we have asked for
8814494 i have the floor i have the floor this is outrageous
8814495 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8814496 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
8814497 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8814498 the real reason that we cant have the ten commandments in a courthouse you cannot post thou shalt not steal thou shalt not commit adultery and thou shalt not lie in a building full of lawyers judges and politicians it creates a hostile work environment
8814499 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
8814500 im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8814501 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8814502 but i dont know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers
8814503 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8814504 what he should not do is what he will be criticized for not doing give a detailed policy speech this is not the place for that
8814505 this website is about brunei it is about providing information that is relevant to people seeking to understand brunei
8814506 this is about promoting brunei as land of opportunity for all people men women and children and for investors
8814507 we have also seen changes reflecting new technologies and their use in the government and business community more importantly the rapid progress of economic globalisation and advances in technology the communication revolution is gaining to an endless journey
8814508 the arrival of the information society accelerating globalisation and rapid technological changes mean that we risk becoming irrelevant and marginalised if we do not innovate and reinvent ourselves
8814509 i urge everyone to use the internet wisely and responsibly let it be one of the sources to energise and inspire us to propel to new heights
8814510 our aim is to put this technology at their service by providing essential information in a more effective and timely manner
8814511 i hope this one decides to just get off katrinas path and goes somewheres else not to wish nothing on nobody else i hope it goes and diminishes somewhere
8814512 when you have growth you have to accommodate growth and sometimes you have growing pains at spanish fort elementary there are empty classrooms some and then at rockwell elementary its filled to the gill
8814513 we wanted to have our daughters go to the rockwell school district as a matter of fact we bought our house based on the rockwell school district
8814514 i know the teachers i have a network there and thats comforting to know when you have another one child coming up
8814515 i just dont think that i should have to uproot my child when i didnt make the choice to move her shes already had that adjustment before
8814516 we strongly recommend to the public that they wash their hands frequently particularly after using the bathroom changing diapers and preparing food persons who are sick with diarrhea should not be involved in food preparation
8814517 take the time to clean hands and food preparation surfaces frequently keep raw meats separate from ready to eat foods cook foods to proper temperatures and refrigerate leftover foods quickly
8814518 ill tell you what i was really proud of our defense tonight
8814519 they got themselves into some situations where we did very well whether it was something that happened on special teams or a turnover they did a great job
8814520 that football team sdsu right there is going to win a lot of games i was happy obviously to see us win a win is a win obviously in these opening games there is some sloppiness you have to alleviate we certainly have to do that this week in practice turnovers cost us on special teams and the turnovers cost us twice on offense so thats unacceptable but im happy over all
8814521 the preliminary report was a factual account of the incident and investigation to date
8814522 there are regions affected by the storm that our teams have not been able to reach
8814523 the majority of victims died when their houses collapsed or were killed by falling trees others drowned when they tried to cross swollen rivers
8814524 the council is proposing this name as it was envisaged in the early 1900s that vincentia would become a port city named pacific city to facilitate and service a proposed national capital city in the region
8814525 artists united in their creativity to benefit ovarian cancer research fund our project ties that bind a hand made doll created with heart and soul donning hand embellished mens dress ties and hand born charms 100 of the profit goes to the ocrf in support of their mission to help ovarian cancer patients and their loved ones
8814526 im the guy with cow on his boots and no bull in his speech
8814527 hes a breath of fresh air he understands america is in trouble and that theres change in the air
8814528 no 2 michelle obama no 3 chelsea clinton no 4 the obamas older daughter malia no 5 hillary clinton
8814529 champ when you get knocked down get up get up
8814530 afghanistan we dont read about it anymore because its succeeded or should we trust barack obama who more than a year ago called for sending two additional combat brigades to afghanistan
8814531 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8814532 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8814533 america our work will not be easy the challenges we face require tough choices and democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the worn out ideas and politics of the past
8814534 you think about everything from campaign finance to immigration and on and theres john mccain working across party lines senator obama doesnt have a record now he can make the claim and he can hold himself up as pure and trying to reach to a new generation of post partisan politics but he has to do so largely based on rhetoric and wishful thinking because he doesnt have the record
8814535 there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically
8814536 obama might have a similar bottom line core principles for which in some sense he is willing to die if so we dont know what they are nothing so far in his life approaches mccains decision to refuse repatriation as a pow so as to deny his jailors a propaganda coup in fact there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically thats why his reversal on campaign financing and his transparently false justification of it matter more than similar acts by mccain
8814537 hes pretty much a conventional liberal on the issues and has few examples of breaking with his own party so how does obama try to pull off being post partisan
8814538 his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
8814539 boren the lone democrat in oklahomas congressional delegate said that while obama has talked about working with republicans unfortunately his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
8814540 the record shows obama to be a fairly doctrinaire liberal democrat
8814541 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8814542 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8814543 for a couple of days theyve been saying you voted to raise taxes something like 94 times that seems to be the drumbeat thats going to happen during this campaign are you going to raise taxes in a big way for average americans
8814544 i mean this is the standard fare of politics and the truth of the matter is that the only bills that i voted for for the most part since ive been in the senate were introduced by republicans with george bush you know they were the majority for a big chunk of the time i was there
8814545 finally the obama people are too convinced that they can define mccain as bush iii the case is just factually inaccurate mccain will be able to pull out dozens of instances from torture to global warming to spending in which he broke with his party as rush limbaugh will tell you
8814546 as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq
8814547 in early november 2003 at a time when fred dalton thompson was playing a tough d a on law and order john mccain was cross examining donald rumsfeld for real on capitol hill it was still very early into the u s occupation of iraq but the as yet unacknowledged by rummy that is insurgency was already out of control alone among his fellow gop senators mccain blasted rumsfeld for not putting enough u s troops on the ground and for resorting too soon to iraqification that is transferring security to ill prepared iraqi forces in an extraordinarily blunt speech at the council on foreign relations that grim autumn mccain warned that ultimately iraq could become another vietnam if we lose popular support in the united states the next day the secretary of defense asked mccain to breakfast i read y our speech harrumphed rumsfeld that must have been an enjoyable experience for him mccain later joked to me then rummy patiently explained to his fellow republican why he and his top civilian brass paul wolfowitz doug feith and the usual crowd of incompetents would continue to do things the same way they believed there was no need for additional troops mccain later related mccain had already realized that rumsfeld was a lost cause the real question the senator suggested to me back then was whether george w bush himself would push rummy to make changes id like to see the president fully engaged mccain said bush needed to be on top of more details of whats going on as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq right down to the need for bush to get engaged and fire rumsfeld mccain was so right that among military experts today the emerging conventional wisdom about bushs current surg e is that if it had occurred back then when mccain wanted it and the political will existed in this country to support it for the necessary number of years it might well have succeeded
8814548 widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush
8814549 on global warming mccain is widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush immediately after the 2004 election in which he stumped for bushs re election he sharply distanced himself from bush on climate change calling the administrations stance terribly disappointing mccain had co sponsored a bill with sen joe lieberman to curb greenhouse gases in 2003 bush had opposed any such move citing possible harm to the economy and doubts over global warming
8814550 he said that our economy has made great progress under this president he said that the fundamentals of the e conomy are strong
8814551 the second and third quotes the obama campaign uses from mccain are more misleading the ad shows mccain saying t heres been great progress economically the quote comes from an interview mccain did with peter cook at bloomberg television in april mccain was making a case for what he believed were positive economic developments during bushs time in office however the fuller quote shows mccain was saying that whatever progress had been made it wouldnt be enough to comfort families facing these tremendous economic challenges his comments overall are pessimistic he cites challenging times and enormous difficulties the obama campaign distorts his views by using just a snippet of his remarks
8814552 im going to ask you a version of the ronald reagan question you think if americans were asked are you better off today than you were before george bush took office more than seven years ago what answer would they give
8814553 certainly in this time we are in very challenging times
8814554 i think if you look at the overall record and millions of jobs have been created et cetera et cetera yo u could make an argument that theres been great progress economically over that period of time but thats no comfort thats no comfort to families now that are facing these tremendous economic challenges but let me just add peter the fundamentals of americas economy are strong were the greatest exporter the greatest importer the greatest innovator the greatest producer still the greatest economic engine in the world and by the way exports and free trade are a key element in economic recovery but these are tough times tough times and nobody knows that more than american families including in small towns of pennsylvania they havent lost their fundamental religious beliefs their respect for the constitution their right to bear arms they are still keep america as a beacon of hope and freedom throughout the world
8814555 he knows how to twist with the best of them
8814556 although obama gets substantial mileage out of running against politics as usual he provided a reminder on friday that he knows how to twist with the best of them
8814557 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow but i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet twenty first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy
8814558 i do not make a promise that we can reduce the budget deficit by 2013
8814559 i do not make a promise that we can reduce it by 2013 because i think it is important for us to make some critical investments right now in americas families obama told reporters this week when asked if hed match mccains pledge
8814560 since winning the nomination obama reportedly has been moving toward the middle of the political spectrum but on the budget he still sounds left of center with no interest in eliminating deficit spending
8814561 frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years
8814562 barack obama says john mccains plan to balance the budget doesnt add up easy for him to say its not a goal hes even trying to reach not only does obama say he wont eliminate the deficit in his first term as mccain aims to do he frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years considering his own spending plans
8814563 obama has rhetorically committed to a pay as you go approach by offsetting new spending and tax cuts with new taxes or spending cuts but his proposals do not come close to meeting this standard
8814564 has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of
8814565 the obama campaign responds that tax cuts once enacted are usually renewed and do not expire therefore they say obama can legitimately claim to be recouping money for other purposes by scaling back the tax cuts obama has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of what he wants to do
8814566 both obama and clinton promised to not raise taxes on those making less than 200 000 or 250 000 a year they both just emasculated their domestic programs returning the rich to their clinton era tax rates will yield at best 40 billion a year in revenue its impossible to fund a health care plan let alone anything else with that kind of money the consequences are clear if elected they will have to break their pledge and thus destroy their credibility or run a minimalist administration
8814567 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8814568 the latest additions to sen barack obamas energy plan outlined during an appearance in lansing monday may win the democratic presidential candidate some votes from disgruntled consumers in november but theyll do nothing to answer the nations long term needs
8814569 when his presumptive republican opponent sen john mccain r ariz proposed a gas tax holiday as a way to reduce the high cost of driving mr obama showed political courage and intellectual honesty by refusing to sign on to that obvious gimmick its an idea to get them through an election mr obama said now he has two such gimmicks of his own
8814570 the politics may have changed but the facts havent the accuracy of sen mccains original position has not changed offshore drilling would not lower gas prices today it would not lower gas prices next year and it would not lower gas prices five years from now
8814571 i think john mccains proposal for a three month tax holiday is a bad idea
8814572 in this campaign john mccain is offering the same old gimmicks that will provide almost no short term relief to folks who are struggling with high gas prices gimmicks that will only increase our addiction for another four years
8814573 that might make sense in washington but it doesnt make sense for america in fact it makes about as much sense as his proposal to build 45 new nuclear reactors without a plan to store the waste some place other than guess where right here in nevada at yucca mountain
8814574 democratic presidential candidate barack obamas proposal for a windfall profits tax on oil companies could cost 15 billion a year at last years profit levels a campaign adviser said
8814575 obama may levy 15 billion tax on oil company profit
8814576 but to add a five year tax increase on top of that to pay for a one year gift to voters would indeed increase the cost of doing business that cost would be passed along in forgone investment in new production lower dividends for pension funds and other shareholders and higher prices at the pump thus socking it to the consumers whom the plan is supposed to help if oil prices fall there might be no windfall profits to tax then the obama rebate would have to be paid for through spending cuts taxes on something else or borrowing
8814577 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families
8814578 what obama voted for was a budget resolution that would have allowed most of the provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to expire in particular the resolution would allow the 25 percent tax bracket to return to its pre 2001 level of 28 percent that bracket kicks in at 32 550 for an individual or 65 100 for a married couple but as those of you who have filled out a 1040 know thats not actually how income taxes work we dont pay taxes on our total earnings we pay them based on our taxable income the urban brookings tax policy centers eric toder told factcheck org that people with taxable income of 32 000 would have a total income greater than that in 2008 anyone filing taxes with single status would be entitled to a standar d deduction of 5 450 as well as a personal exemption of 3 500 so to have a taxable income high enough to reach the 25 percent bracket an individual would need to earn at least 41 500 in total income while a married couple would need a combined income of at least 83 000
8814579 certainly obamas votes indicate a willingness to raise taxes and obama has not been shy about saying explicitly that he will raise some taxes
8814580 campaign aides to senator obama today called the charge that he voted for tax hikes on people making only 32 000 a year quote bogus they circulated an analysis stating that the resolution that obama had voted for would not have increase taxes on single taxpayer making less than 41 500 a year in total income
8814581 vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year
8814582 i got elected when i was 29 and i got elected november the 7 th and on december 18 of that year my wife and three kids were christmas shopping for a christmas tree a tractor trailer a guy who allegedly and i never pursued it drank his lunch instead of eating his lunch broadsided my family and killed my wife instantly and killed my daughter instantly and hospitalized my two sons with what were thought to be at the time permanent fundamental injuries
8814583 all i said was what i heard at the time what i heard from folks at the time is hed been drinking
8814584 i dont want to talk about it she must have pulled out its still painful to talk about 35 years later
8814585 id be delighted to sit down and compare my iq to yours
8814586 blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness for theirs is the kingdom of heaven

8814591 i am currently looking to replace my desktop pc with a high spec laptop portability isnt a concern as it will spend most of its life on a desk here are a couple of things i am looking for biggest screen possible plenty of hdd space plenty of ram and plenty of ghzs cheaper is better but my budget is up to around 3 000
8814592 it is important for a judge to always do wide research to enable him or her write concise precise and effective judgments
8814593 since you have a border booming with business we shall acquaint you with the work of the high court commercial division this will help you in handling commercial related cases
8814594 what this takes is some real fighters to oppose it on behalf of the communities involved
8814595 i have found no benefit for the people of the 14th district in this proposed merger
8814596 clearly that proposal is well short of the requirement to significantly minimize any negative impacts this sale might bring about
8814597 instead of having an east to west problem youll have a north south east and west problem
8814598 there could be significant railway bottlenecks without some significant financial rebuilding of the rail system im not so sure that you dont answer one problem with this move but put three more on the table in doing so
8814599 we had no idea the savings would be as significant as they turned out to be
8814600 were trying to do our best to make sure were as ready for winter as we can be
8814601 well have 10 000 tons of salt in our two domes before winter even starts
8814602 everybodys talking about it being over 100 a ton im not so sure
8814603 life begins at conception is a core issue of faith
8814604 the democrats are the party of roosevelt and kennedy who has the nerve to suggest we cant defend this country
8814605 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
8814606 andys changed his life around 180 degrees and as a coaching staff weve seen the positive impact hes made in the program
8814607 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
8814608 people want to know if there will be a carnival and i tell them no
8814609 this is an old fashioned celebration which will really focus on our history and the picnic is a true picnic there wont be any food for sale so bring a picnic basket
8814610 i think the celebration will say that were proud of our past and the blue collar workers who founded batavia and filled it with a lot of community spirit
8814611 marilyn robinson wrote it for the 150th celebration and it was never performed
8814612 she has been a great historian for batavia the pageant really puts batavias history into perspective
8814613 the celebration as well as the service gives us a chance to stop and think about the ideals and values that the people who settled this community brought with them
8814614 they were dedicated not only to literally building homes for themselves but to creating a community institution
8814615 i will tell the people at the worship service that the first public building in batavia was a school it wasnt a tavern or a church it was later used for civic gatherings and for church services but it was built as a school in 1834 just one year after christopher payne settled here it indicates that there was a concern for the common good
8814616 it is a reminder to all of us that we are part of a community that reaches not only laterally from neighbor to neighbor but historically from generation to generation
8814617 as a member of the citys leadership team its humbling to think that we are stewards of a community that has existed for so long but we are also reminded that the implications of what we do today will have an impact far into the future
8814618 this purchase will add nothing to the communities along this line there is no benefit which will accrue to our community only problems
8814619 we have no intention to be enslaved by a railroad
8814620 i dont want anyone to have this in their backyard
8814621 am 4 november m ssen wir aufstehen und sagen acht sind genug
8814622 we still hope to remain an acute care facility but we presented a restructuring plan to the state in conjunction with the closing plan
8814623 some of our space and resources to other types of health care
8814624 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight
8814625 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8814626 been talking about our addiction to foreign oil for 30 years
8814627 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8814628 john mccain has said hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8814629 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy dont tell me we cant keep this country safe
8814630 what most people dont seem to realize is that there is just as much money to be made out of the wreckage of a civilization as from the upbuilding of one
8814631 first expedition in that scientists and cultural practitioners were on the same ship
8814632 helped us all gain a lot from each other and also a better understanding of the monuments resources
8814633 the team was diving close to the reef and came across an iron ballast
8814634 came across the anchors what may be cannon and a tripot and the tripot is what indicates a whaling shipwreck site
8814635 these shipwrecks are like windows into that past and we can understand through looking at the artifacts that nature of the wreck the type of the vessel and sometimes even what the crew went through to survive on these distant atolls
8814636 after just a few minutes of diving we came across a historic anchor which is really exciting we tow boarded a little bit further came back to that area and discovered what opened up to a whole shipwreck site
8814637 some of those sailors up there had been a couple other shipwreck events
8814638 what keeps it in balance there its the presence of those big fish the balance here is a little out of wack we dont have those big fish we have two legged predators instead
8814639 we cant be a pristine ecosystem as it is up there because we have people here but how can we make it work
8814640 its such a historic moment best experience of my life
8814641 yeah its a chicken skin moments i just didnt think it could last for five minutes
8814642 has had numerous negative impacts on existing freshwater and tidal wetlands at least two state endangered and or threatened plant species and a steep slope in the area of a wooded ravine
8814643 to ravine contruction for violating the conditions of the tidal wetlands permit issued to the department of parks amp recreation
8814644 the violation involves clearing and grading beyond the scope of the permit
8814645 full nature and extent of the violation is under investigation
8814646 if this were in central park it wouldnt look like this
8814647 the permit allows them to work in a 20 foot wide space but in places it stretches out 30 40 even 50 feet
8814648 me and the guitar we got a lot of love
8814649 the passenger door the front door was kind of open
8814650 i just like the crispy sound it sounds a little more bass
8814651 we checking here we checking there i just like to thank all of them guys
8814652 i told the guys at the like like drive inn that the person could bring the guitar just drop it off and you know disappear and its all good
8814653 i just heard that its called the killer killer rock
8814654 with the two rocks falling earlier this month i guess theyre finally acting on it cause theyre afraid
8814655 it feels exciting because we had to sign a lot of autographs and being a world champion is a lot of fun because were number one in the world
8814656 it came from our coach he kept telling us one team one goal and never give up always believe
8814657 tells you to never give up and just be positive no matter what happens
8814658 youve gotta be disciplined youve gotta be smart youve gotta have teamwork i mean leadership they get it here
8814659 high cholesterol diabetes lack of activity as we get older we become less active so we dont derive the many benefits from exercise as we get older
8814660 weve been doing a lot of research with the honolulu heart program in relation to physical activity such as walking and we have found that the benefits of walking are tremendous especially among the diabetic individuals
8814661 among the people that are very active or that walk approximately a mile and a half per day or more the rates are similar to the people that dont have diabetes
8814662 locally we see big variations with for example the native hawaiians having very high rates of cardio vascular disease mortality as well as the filipino as compared for example the chinese women may die of cardiovascular disease at age 85 so 20 years later big differences
8814663 time is muscle its important to get that artery opened up and salvage whatever heart muscle they can thats probably the most important thing it doesnt really matter too much what happens afterwards if you cant to that muscle and open up the artery
8814664 in beijing there were fantastic results but i think we can look at it as a stepping stone for london 2012
8814665 if we can be top of the rowing medal table without our home crowd in london im sure we can do better
8814666 he started off this year saying this would be the very very last year he ever does it and hes going to retire full stop
8814667 i do this sport because i love winning and i love racing and as long as it keeps going like that im sure ill love doing it
8814668 this is a nice very very pleasant bucolic woodland setting as is you see almost 50 years of growth here at the same time you can see how its been abused you can see a lot of garbage trash abandoned objects strewn abhttp go microsoft com fwlink linkid 30857 amp clcid 0x409out
8814669 this has been in the dark for too long i think people once they realize that its here and the opportunities it has its really going to be something that people celebrate
8814670 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8814671 america our work will not be easy the challenges we face require tough choices and democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the worn out ideas and politics of the past
8814672 you think about everything from campaign finance to immigration and on and theres john mccain working across party lines senator obama doesnt have a record now he can make the claim and he can hold himself up as pure and trying to reach to a new generation of post partisan politics but he has to do so largely based on rhetoric and wishful thinking because he doesnt have the record
8814673 there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically
8814674 obama might have a similar bottom line core principles for which in some sense he is willing to die if so we dont know what they are nothing so far in his life approaches mccains decision to refuse repatriation as a pow so as to deny his jailors a propaganda coup in fact there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically thats why his reversal on campaign financing and his transparently false justification of it matter more than similar acts by mccain
8814675 hes pretty much a conventional liberal on the issues and has few examples of breaking with his own party so how does obama try to pull off being post partisan
8814676 his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
8814677 boren the lone democrat in oklahomas congressional delegate said that while obama has talked about working with republicans unfortunately his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
8814678 the record shows obama to be a fairly doctrinaire liberal democrat
8814679 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8814680 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8814681 for a couple of days theyve been saying you voted to raise taxes something like 94 times that seems to be the drumbeat thats going to happen during this campaign are you going to raise taxes in a big way for average americans
8814682 i mean this is the standard fare of politics and the truth of the matter is that the only bills that i voted for for the most part since ive been in the senate were introduced by republicans with george bush you know they were the majority for a big chunk of the time i was there
8814683 finally the obama people are too convinced that they can define mccain as bush iii the case is just factually inaccurate mccain will be able to pull out dozens of instances from torture to global warming to spending in which he broke with his party as rush limbaugh will tell you
8814684 as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq
8814685 in early november 2003 at a time when fred dalton thompson was playing a tough d a on law and order john mccain was cross examining donald rumsfeld for real on capitol hill it was still very early into the u s occupation of iraq but the as yet unacknowledged by rummy that is insurgency was already out of control alone among his fellow gop senators mccain blasted rumsfeld for not putting enough u s troops on the ground and for resorting too soon to iraqification that is transferring security to ill prepared iraqi forces in an extraordinarily blunt speech at the council on foreign relations that grim autumn mccain warned that ultimately iraq could become another vietnam if we lose popular support in the united states the next day the secretary of defense asked mccain to breakfast i read y our speech harrumphed rumsfeld that must have been an enjoyable experience for him mccain later joked to me then rummy patiently explained to his fellow republican why he and his top civilian brass paul wolfowitz doug feith and the usual crowd of incompetents would continue to do things the same way they believed there was no need for additional troops mccain later related mccain had already realized that rumsfeld was a lost cause the real question the senator suggested to me back then was whether george w bush himself would push rummy to make changes id like to see the president fully engaged mccain said bush needed to be on top of more details of whats going on as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq right down to the need for bush to get engaged and fire rumsfeld mccain was so right that among military experts today the emerging conventional wisdom about bushs current surg e is that if it had occurred back then when mccain wanted it and the political will existed in this country to support it for the necessary number of years it might well have succeeded
8814686 widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush
8814687 on global warming mccain is widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush immediately after the 2004 election in which he stumped for bushs re election he sharply distanced himself from bush on climate change calling the administrations stance terribly disappointing mccain had co sponsored a bill with sen joe lieberman to curb greenhouse gases in 2003 bush had opposed any such move citing possible harm to the economy and doubts over global warming
8814688 he said that our economy has made great progress under this president he said that the fundamentals of the e conomy are strong
8814689 the second and third quotes the obama campaign uses from mccain are more misleading the ad shows mccain saying t heres been great progress economically the quote comes from an interview mccain did with peter cook at bloomberg television in april mccain was making a case for what he believed were positive economic developments during bushs time in office however the fuller quote shows mccain was saying that whatever progress had been made it wouldnt be enough to comfort families facing these tremendous economic challenges his comments overall are pessimistic he cites challenging times and enormous difficulties the obama campaign distorts his views by using just a snippet of his remarks
8814690 im going to ask you a version of the ronald reagan question you think if americans were asked are you better off today than you were before george bush took office more than seven years ago what answer would they give
8814691 certainly in this time we are in very challenging times
8814692 i think if you look at the overall record and millions of jobs have been created et cetera et cetera yo u could make an argument that theres been great progress economically over that period of time but thats no comfort thats no comfort to families now that are facing these tremendous economic challenges but let me just add peter the fundamentals of americas economy are strong were the greatest exporter the greatest importer the greatest innovator the greatest producer still the greatest economic engine in the world and by the way exports and free trade are a key element in economic recovery but these are tough times tough times and nobody knows that more than american families including in small towns of pennsylvania they havent lost their fundamental religious beliefs their respect for the constitution their right to bear arms they are still keep america as a beacon of hope and freedom throughout the world
8814693 he knows how to twist with the best of them
8814694 although obama gets substantial mileage out of running against politics as usual he provided a reminder on friday that he knows how to twist with the best of them
8814695 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow but i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet twenty first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy
8814696 i do not make a promise that we can reduce the budget deficit by 2013
8814697 i do not make a promise that we can reduce it by 2013 because i think it is important for us to make some critical investments right now in americas families obama told reporters this week when asked if hed match mccains pledge
8814698 since winning the nomination obama reportedly has been moving toward the middle of the political spectrum but on the budget he still sounds left of center with no interest in eliminating deficit spending
8814699 frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years
8814700 barack obama says john mccains plan to balance the budget doesnt add up easy for him to say its not a goal hes even trying to reach not only does obama say he wont eliminate the deficit in his first term as mccain aims to do he frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years considering his own spending plans
8814701 obama has rhetorically committed to a pay as you go approach by offsetting new spending and tax cuts with new taxes or spending cuts but his proposals do not come close to meeting this standard
8814702 has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of
8814703 the obama campaign responds that tax cuts once enacted are usually renewed and do not expire therefore they say obama can legitimately claim to be recouping money for other purposes by scaling back the tax cuts obama has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of what he wants to do
8814704 both obama and clinton promised to not raise taxes on those making less than 200 000 or 250 000 a year they both just emasculated their domestic programs returning the rich to their clinton era tax rates will yield at best 40 billion a year in revenue its impossible to fund a health care plan let alone anything else with that kind of money the consequences are clear if elected they will have to break their pledge and thus destroy their credibility or run a minimalist administration
8814705 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8814706 the latest additions to sen barack obamas energy plan outlined during an appearance in lansing monday may win the democratic presidential candidate some votes from disgruntled consumers in november but theyll do nothing to answer the nations long term needs
8814707 when his presumptive republican opponent sen john mccain r ariz proposed a gas tax holiday as a way to reduce the high cost of driving mr obama showed political courage and intellectual honesty by refusing to sign on to that obvious gimmick its an idea to get them through an election mr obama said now he has two such gimmicks of his own
8814708 the politics may have changed but the facts havent the accuracy of sen mccains original position has not changed offshore drilling would not lower gas prices today it would not lower gas prices next year and it would not lower gas prices five years from now
8814709 i think john mccains proposal for a three month tax holiday is a bad idea
8814710 in this campaign john mccain is offering the same old gimmicks that will provide almost no short term relief to folks who are struggling with high gas prices gimmicks that will only increase our addiction for another four years
8814711 that might make sense in washington but it doesnt make sense for america in fact it makes about as much sense as his proposal to build 45 new nuclear reactors without a plan to store the waste some place other than guess where right here in nevada at yucca mountain
8814712 democratic presidential candidate barack obamas proposal for a windfall profits tax on oil companies could cost 15 billion a year at last years profit levels a campaign adviser said
8814713 obama may levy 15 billion tax on oil company profit
8814714 but to add a five year tax increase on top of that to pay for a one year gift to voters would indeed increase the cost of doing business that cost would be passed along in forgone investment in new production lower dividends for pension funds and other shareholders and higher prices at the pump thus socking it to the consumers whom the plan is supposed to help if oil prices fall there might be no windfall profits to tax then the obama rebate would have to be paid for through spending cuts taxes on something else or borrowing
8814715 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families
8814716 what obama voted for was a budget resolution that would have allowed most of the provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to expire in particular the resolution would allow the 25 percent tax bracket to return to its pre 2001 level of 28 percent that bracket kicks in at 32 550 for an individual or 65 100 for a married couple but as those of you who have filled out a 1040 know thats not actually how income taxes work we dont pay taxes on our total earnings we pay them based on our taxable income the urban brookings tax policy centers eric toder told factcheck org that people with taxable income of 32 000 would have a total income greater than that in 2008 anyone filing taxes with single status would be entitled to a standar d deduction of 5 450 as well as a personal exemption of 3 500 so to have a taxable income high enough to reach the 25 percent bracket an individual would need to earn at least 41 500 in total income while a married couple would need a combined income of at least 83 000
8814717 certainly obamas votes indicate a willingness to raise taxes and obama has not been shy about saying explicitly that he will raise some taxes
8814718 campaign aides to senator obama today called the charge that he voted for tax hikes on people making only 32 000 a year quote bogus they circulated an analysis stating that the resolution that obama had voted for would not have increase taxes on single taxpayer making less than 41 500 a year in total income
8814719 vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year
8814720 factcheck org a nonpartisan web site said the vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year the 32 000 figure it said was the amount of taxable income those people had

8814723 democrats in the end speak most of and seem to hold the most sympathy for the beset upon single mother without medical coverage for her children and the soldier back from the war who needs more help with post traumatic stress disorder they express the most sympathy for the needy the yearning the marginalized and unwell for those in short who need more help from the government meaning from the governments treasury meaning the money got from taxpayers who happen also to be a generally beset upon group democrats show little expressed sympathy for those who work to make the money the government taxes to help the beset upon mother and the soldier and the kids they express little sympathy for the middle aged woman who owns a small dry cleaner and employs six people and is actually day to day stressed and depressed from the burden of state local and federal taxes and regulations and lawsuits and meetings with the accountant and complaints as to insufficient or incorrect efforts to meet guidelines regarding various employee employer rules and regulations at republican conventions they express sympathy for this woman as they do for those who are entrepreneurial who start businesses and create jobs and build things republicans have that is sympathy for taxpayers but they dont dwell all that much or show much expressed sympathy for the sick mother with the uninsured kids and the soldier with the shot nerves neither party ever gets it quite right the balance between the taxed and the needy the suffering of one sort and the suffering of another you might say that in this both parties are equally cold and equally warm only to two different classes of citizens

8814736 eran solo luces brillantes y se mov an lentamente hacia arriba hacia las nubes algunas parec an estar avanzando en formaci n y una se elev y se uni a las dem s parec an c rculo durante unos minutos luego se elevaron lentamente a trav s de las nubes y fuera de la vista
8814737 toda la experiencia dur unos cinco minutos y las estuvimos viendo hasta que la ltima luz desapareci
8814738 las luces parec an ser bastante grandes pero es dif cil decirlo realmente la nica explicaci n que podr a dar ser a que parec an globos de helio con luces adentro a pesar de que suena un poco rid culo
8814739 sea lo que fueren no he visto nada como eso y mi hijo y yo tuvimos una vista de p jaro justo sobre la ciudad hacia donde fueron suelo ser un poco esc ptico con respecto a estas cosas pero no puedo explicar de manera adecuada lo que vi
8814740 aparecieron en el cielo sobre la azotea frente a nuestra casa movi ndose con lentitud pero en direcci n sur oeste a nordeste al parecer hab a 12 o m s luces brillantes blancas en formaci n con unas rezagadas
8814741 a menudo veo las luces de las aeronaves que vuelan en la noche pero hab a demasiadas de estas luces todas juntas para ser aviones los aviones suelen tener luces y esas luces no parpadeaban
8814742 mi esposa y yo salimos a ver y trat de echar un vistazo con mis binoculares pero no pude verlas m s claro las vimos durante un par de minutos hasta que salieron de la vista detr s de las nubes
8814743 fue una vista muy inusual y diferente de lo que he visto antes
8814744 mi esposa y yo observamos estas luces mientras est bamos en el estacionamiento en mcdonalds al igual que otras personas vimos unas 20 luces como si se desplazaran en formaci n
8814745 our government should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every american whos willing to work thats the promise of america the idea that we are responsible for ourselves but that we also rise or fall as one nation the fundamental belief that i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper thats the promise we need to keep
8814746 in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8814747 okay i have had hands laid on me i have been commissioned as an apostle and i have been taught and commended philippians 2 19 22 by the great apostle paul it is time to move on to more of god
8814748 as you could see even if they send me a text message i dont reply because i dont want anything to do with them
8814749 the last time i sent message to them is when someone in their family died i just send my condolences and that was it
8814750 maybe you would have another grandchild in the future that you could take care of and bring up the way you wanted
8814751 its always an exciting time we had the chance to scrimmage wake forest last saturday going over there to the field that were going to play on this weekend so i think our preparation has been very good were not ready yet but i think weve hit the major points obviously you get better as the season goes on but i feel like this preseason has been incredibly productive in terms of preparing us to play michigan and iowa were prepared to play back to back and im excited about that when you go into a game there is comfort in trusting your preparation and i think our players feel good about it
8814752 i hate to let that year go it was pretty darn special but weve got to let it go hopefully that experience will help motivate this years group they know how much fun it was to win the national championship and i think theyre pretty darn hungry
8814753 i didnt know what to expect but i really felt like it was an exciting and wonderful day and i think our team thought so too it was educational in nature to have the tour of the white house and it was fun to be recognized among the other champions it was something that exceeded all of our expectations
8814754 every year is different and i dont feel like its getting old winning that championship last year has re energized me i think i was feeling some pressure about not getting to the final four i think thats human nature and to win it really kind of excited and energized and gave me the confidence that maybe was waning to now approach this year with renewed energy
8814755 this freshman class is very solid im excited about them they are loving it theres no homesickness no whining and complaining theyre enjoying being in this environment well have two that will contribute right away in charlotte verstraten the rest of them are just learning every day and im so excited for them because theyre all going to play for the university of north carolina eventually
8814756 im hoping shed going to get some good rest this week ii want her to get some rest be able to breathe and not feel stressed im going to try to take as much pressure off her as i possibly can shes been through a very emotional and grueling tournament and she needs some time right now
8814757 theres no doubt shell be able to draw from that experience she is an inspiration to her teammates i think were all very proud that she was the only college player on the u s olympic team also beneficial is the fact that someone else has been able to play in her position namely who has stepped into the midfield during the preseason she went from being only a forward to being a more versatile player a more valuable player to our team because shes been able to play in kates spot and now were a deeper team because of it it helps in all kinds of ways some ways that we dont know about just yet
8814758 im thrilled that our staff is unchanged for the third year because that gives us great stability and continuity i think we have the best staff in the country both
8814759 were also lucky to have outstanding support from our strength and conditioning coach steve gisselman and having our video coordinator jarrett alston with us for the third year allows us to continue to build on what weve done from a video standpoint in terms of game preparation
8814760 the acc big ten challenge is always an exciting way to start the year
8814761 the tournament at west chester the vonnie gros classic is a homecoming for a lot of people
8814762 i think as much as anything else it was an educational moment
8814763 we talked about the games that contributed to us not making it just looking at those games they were shaking their heads and saying we should have won that one i think after that experience our returners understood that making the playoffs was possible that was the first thing they needed to do
8814764 a lot of times when you have the greatest challenges is when you have the greatest successes as well and so we could have one of those types of years
8814765 when people have asked me about last season ive said i thought we maximized what we had last year and as a coach if you can maximize what you have then your team has done well and your program is doing great if we can maximize what we have this year then i will be quite satisfied as well and that is really the key for our team right now
8814766 briana had an excellent season last year and we are hoping she can once again carry out a season like that
8814767 silvestris performance in 2007 is a credit to her no question but i think part of the credit also goes to her ability to absorb and learn what she could from the player before her
8814768 i am extremely happy with the way jessie has performed leading up to the season
8814769 her game is outstanding and i think will have a big year for us
8814770 to be honest i think alexandras first year was the tip of the iceberg
8814771 as well as she did last year she is significantly better this season and shell be really strong for us
8814772 carly played very well on both side of the ball last spring and i expect shell continue to do so this season
8814773 i thought jill was our most improved player in the spring
8814774 she is mobile and transitional and she has the ability to both defend and attack
8814775 her mobility is something that would have really helped us
8814776 she was excelling in our winter conditioning program and we were really looking forward to what shed be able to contribute
8814777 karin did a great job last season and she has continued to do well during our fall preseason
8814778 she has the most experience of anyone on our frontline and we are expecting her to take that experience and help the players around her
8814779 this is the best i have seen her play and and at the same time she is also providing some leadership i think she will be a positive link to our young front line in helping them try to get it and understand how to work through the season
8814780 it was a big hit when we lost erica last year
8814781 she is an even more powerful athlete after a year of rehabbing and as she gets her game back i think she is will be very good for us
8814782 molly is someone who would be able to contribute because of the way she plays the game
8814783 she is a thinking player who is very calm when she is in front of the goal
8814784 sierra is every bit as good as we thought shed be
8814785 she is fast and dangerous and she has no thought in her head other than going to the goal
8814786 we knew leeza was a strong athlete coming in but she has shown she has more to her game and i think she can help us out down the line
8814787 the hope of council is giving everybody an opportunity to have different methods of voting well see a greater participation in this years election
8814788 were really hopeful this will provide an opportunity for more people to exercise their democratic right
8814789 they can do this on a cellphone computer from their work they can do it from anywhere
8814790 for this municipal election we have doubled probably what we would have spent on municipal elections
8814791 this is a new opportunity to present the history of this community
8814792 in the end i think we want visitors to come away from here saying wow i discovered something really fascinating about my community and i want to learn some more
8814793 in a museum setting you are always dependent on having objects to tell the story but along with that in this collection there is a richness in historic photography
8814794 theres not going to be a lot of text for the most part the objects will speak for themselves
8814795 because of the physical nature of the building its long history as a creamery we felt it very important to preserve key historic elements of the creamery as well
8814796 we have a pretty unique thing on the eastern seaboard there are stories of creameries large and small across the country and this is one of the few surviving with original equipment to tell the story
8814797 corda is looking for some advice on how to solve one of the key workplace issues that issue is how to get employees to and from their place of employment in areas as diverse as the truro power centre and the debert industrial park
8814798 from what he tells us its so close id be able to walk down the beach holding my wifes hand again
8814799 that would be the best thing to feel the sand between my toes again
8814800 i love the beach but i havent been in the beach in years because its hard to travel through sand in a wheelchair
8814801 theyre good for cardiovascular and upper body strength but i want my legs back and thats why i am doing this
8814802 braking on the rim will heat up the rim and blow the tire
8814803 back then a lot of these things green economic initiatives were very small and localized think of them as little bits of yeast that have now come together to make the whole loaf of bread

8814817 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction
8814818 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8814819 i have never been to those meetings its hurtful to my family and if i was involved with a woman in a monogamous relationship it would be hurtful to her
8814820 there was another story claiming i was a neat freak if i had to choose one of the two i think id rather be a sex addict its not funny and ill be glad when it goes away
8814821 which i always found very exciting and then i found out it wasnt true
8814822 they gotta get the new cow maybe youve got to get the bull after hes had a lot of cows so you might just be the last new one
8814823 i woke up this morning and i went to google and i googled the entire martin luther king speech because like most americans i you know you listen to the i have a dream part in the earlier part of the speech he talks about the promise of democracy and i think that today that promise was fulfilled in a way that i never imagined in my lifetime
8814824 and what i saw with barack obama was something that was transcendent and i felt transformational for me as a human being and for this country and i only pray in the deepest part of my being that america will rise to this moment and i feel that what he was able to offer us as individual citizens and as a united country was something that we have never seen before i really i think its the most powerful thing ive ever experienced

8814840 anyone disagree that by january 2011 cityscape will only comprise two blocks of mediocre retail and a single high rise a carbon copy of the collier center as i originally suggested in february 2007 granted this is a position on which id like to be wrong but the signs all point one way the most telling coming a few months ago when the projects developer red development split the incentives in its development agreement so that it could receive half of the promised millions from the city even if it only built one tower at cityscape right now red is saying that its building the office tower on the block on the east side of central and washington streets but that the hotel condo tower will follow in a few months
8814841 theres a higher saturation of police and private security in this area than anywhere else in the city
8814842 we spend more time fighting perception than crime in this area
8814843 the administration of the asu downtown phoenix campus in conjunction with the city of phoenix is committed to creating and sustaining a community environment that is safe and productive for students faculty and all members of the community we believe that in order to provide a safe and productive learning environment we must partner with our students and provide them not only with a strong police and security presence on the asu downtown phoenix campus but also provide opportunities for them to actively engage in the promotion of personal and community safety
8814844 the crime rate in this area is very low because of the amount of patrol zones and officers in the area
8814845 in addition to our regular patrol officers we have bike foot and mounted patrols parking enforcement and liaison officers that are constantly looking for suspicious activity its one of the safest sections of the city
8814846 i am not disappointed that it has been slow but it has taken a little longer than i hoped to get things in place
8814847 i didnt think of him as someone to send out on mechanical tasks of digging out all the cases
8814848 developed a self discipline so complete that he has established dominion over not only what he does but also how he feels
8814849 pouring concrete foundations is way beyond what we will allow
8814850 after an accident like that people are a lot more cautious
8814851 that particular accident is very unlikely to happen again either because of improvements or the fact that substandard platforms arent here anymore
8814852 i think this is overdone because youre going to have shut ins at the very least and then well talk about what kind of damage we have
8814853 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
8814854 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent
8814855 i think thats taking some of the steam out of this rally
8814856 i wanted a roof for every family bread for every mouth education for every heart light for every intellect i am convinced that the human history has not yet begun that we find ourselves in the last period of the prehistoric i see with the eyes of my soul how the sky is diffused with rays of the new millennium

8814862 our flagship gomobile service has been extremely well received in the marketplace and is viewed as the standard in m commerce technology that said many small retailers have indicated their particular business needs do not necessarily require such a robust solution so we developed gomobile lite an entry level version of gomobile that serves the specific needs of the small retailer market

8814873 i am not thinking about anything right now just enjoying the moment
8814874 this is very disappointing to me but something i have to accept

8814881 prachi is ektas close friend so when ekta heard that prachi had a crush on this guy from pune called varun she went to great lengths to get him to mumbai long distance romances never flourish much and prachi was finding it difficult to concentrate on work so her executives met the boy offered him a role in ektas serial kis des mein hai meraa dil and found him accommodation in mumbai everything was arranged for varun and handed to him on a platter as people in balaji are very fond of prachi and dont want her to feel upset about anything this is the first time prachi has expressed her crush on someone and they want her to be genuinely happy balaji doesnt mind romances or affairs as long as people are happy and focused on their work
8814882 i am not dating anybody right now yes i attended junior college at pune for a year but i dont know anyone by the name of varun i should tell balaji to get me people i really have crushes on when i was in college i used to have big crushes on hrithik roshan and shahid kapoor i find farhan akhtar very cute from the time i was in my 8th grade i have been a huge fan of his and dil chahta hai which i watched many times working with farhan was a dream come true
8814883 hes so witty and has such a great sense of humor apart from being an amazing actor farhan has this unusual knack of making people feel comfortable right from the first day initially i was very nervous but he made me just go with the flow
8814884 its different from the bani of kasamh se i am the reason the band gets back together i play sakshi who adores farhan and wants to see him happy she keeps making compromises till one day theres a turning point
8814885 we received information that banana sellers were mixing carbide powder with ice and applying it externally on the fruits we have taken samples to analyse the contents we will ensure that the offenders are punished
8814886 we have no choice but to use chemicals usually bananas take 15 days to ripen so we place the bananas on ice mixed with carbide powder to ripen them within four days this also gives the fruits an appealing yellow colour
8814887 this happens not only at the vile parle w market but at markets all over traders will not profit without injecting the chemicals hotels use harmful chemicals as well
8814888 they will take 40 days for their analysis by then the bananas will get spoilt i will have to suffer a loss of rs 40 000 they are harassing us because we refused to pay them rs 10 000 to stop sealing our stock this is the work of builder abhijit rane who wants to redevelop our market without compensating us
8814889 you know i probably wouldnt have fed them not out of selflessness but out of the fact that i simply wouldnt have thought to
8814890 as australias largest home loan provider it makes good strategic sense to look at alternative investments in this industry that will continue to bring benefits to shareholders and consumers mr norris said
8814891 the australian mortgage and housing industries are the backbone of the economy and the purchase of a home remains the largest single investment made by many consumers
8814892 as this market continues to develop a strategic investment in one of the market leading providers in this industry is a natural fit for the group he added
8814893 the ubiquitous use of debt is a thing of the past he said
8814894 much smaller business after it cuts staff numbers to around 150 by 20010 from 480 at the end of june 30
8814895 when the credit crisis hit we were in transition from a balance sheet investor to a funds manager he said

8814898 we expect to get the current carrying value for the assets as at june 30 and would hope for a bit more mr clarke said
8814899 we need to keep our people otherwise we havent got a value proposition mr clarke said
8814900 we had the us market up with the trifecta of indexes all up over one per cent he said
8814901 what gave our market a lot of confidence was the gross domestic product figures out of the us last night which were very strong and that buried all the doomsayers again for a while
8814902 it wasnt all a bed of roses with the metal prices reversing their big increase with moderate declines overnight he said
8814903 for how many years must the planet cool before we begin to understand that the planet is not warming
8814904 here we look at the graph at the last 100 years and here we look at carbon dioxide climbing from about 280ppm to 380 now and we see temperature as well and we have talked about it all day here havent we about the natural variation which produced the ups and downs through the 1910s 1920s 1930s and 40s increasing going down apparently independent of carbon dioxide and now an increase in temperature thanks to carbon dioxide apparently and i think we need to have this in our minds all the time how sure can we be if i could have the next slide please if we look at last ten years this is the thing we have been quarrelling about you see on left there in 1998 the temperature when we had the el nino and the very high peak in 1998 and then a general sinking and flattening and then two years of sharply decreasing temperatures i dont think anyone quarrels about this this is international data and well established graphs you see the carbon dioxide curve going straight across that diagram from left to right upwards so my question is extremely simple we know temperature goes up and down we know there is tremendous amount of natural variations but for how many years must the planet cool before we begin to understand we politicians and scientists that the planet is not warming for how many years must cooling go on
8814905 oil makes us sick coal makes us sick global warming makes us sick
8814906 colder than average temperatures this winter with only the far west and southeast in line for near normal readings
8814907 this is going to be catastrophic for millions of people
8814908 the u s needs to eliminate both ethanol and foreign oil if it is worth fighting for in the middle east it is worth drilling for in the united states
8814909 when i was growing up i felt the dragons were my family
8814910 but today the dragons are angry with us and see us as enemies
8814911 for us giving food to the dragons is an obligation our sacred duty
8814912 we dont want the komodo dragon to be domesticated its against natural balance
8814913 we have to keep this conservation area for the purpose of wildlife it is not for human beings
8814914 if we let the locals hunt again the dragons will be gone
8814915 if we are not strict in enforcing the ban everything here will be destroyed
8814916 people are scared because every day the dragons come down and eat our goats
8814917 today its a goat and tomorrow it can be our child
8814918 we threw branches and stones to drive him away but the dragon was crazed with blood and just wouldnt let go
8814919 i dont blame the dragons for my boys death i blame those who forbade us from following custom and feeding them
8814920 if it werent for them my boy would still be alive
8814921 shouldnt have crouched like a prey species in a place where dragons live
8814922 youve got to be very careful about extrapolating and drawing any conclusions
8814923 any concern expressed by the villagers will be taken seriously and we will address it if we can
8814924 the smell of the village goats chicken drying fish all this invites the dragons
8814925 and if the dragons cant grab the animals they will bite the villagers
8814926 you have got people encouraged to buy a block of land way out of the city and they are having to travel for three hours a day to commute thats not sustainable
8814927 people there live in town houses or terrace houses the houses are never one storey and you have got the population that lives closer to the city
8814928 we have to curtail land subdivisions at the extremities of the city the other option is to put in some very fast trains to regional centres somewhere like geelong could be an attractive destination for working and living
8814929 the population is still growing and theres a demand for these properties
8814930 its near impossible to dictate to the market what should happen the thing thats keeping victorias economy very competitive compared to the mining states is we are very competitive in housing
8814931 the improver of natural knowledge absolutely refuses to acknowledge authority as such for him scepticism is the highest of duties blind faith the one unpardonable sin
8814932 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
8814933 the desire to save humanity is always a false front for the urge to rule it

8815222 the existence of separate pay systems in the different agencies of the dft is being used quite cynically to reduce the pay bill by paying people at inadequate rates where they can get away with it
8815223 a majority of staff in the dvla unlike dft staff as a whole are based in wales where economic conditions are already worse than other areas of the uk and the lower pay rates are costing the welsh economy 13 million every year
8815224 there is a difference between dvla and department for transport salaries at some grades but it is dvlas policy to align its pay rates to the local market in which it competes for staff
8815225 maintaining a service to customers is a priority and the agency will ensure disruption to customer service is minimised

8815234 the problem with depression is no one can see the wheelchair or the crutches if they could theyd be more careful about what they say
8815235 in fact the most appealing aspect of the speech is the way in which obama delivered it he looked and sounded up to the challenge such a large crowd commanded you could have watched the speech with your television on mute and you would have known just based on his delivery what point of the speech he was in obama could read the back of your cereal box to you in the morning and it would sound like he was saying something profound you need more riboflavin

8815239 for instance suppose a prisoner finds out another prisoner has money or other assets they might find themselves coerced into a marriage with a more powerful inmate who might try to lay claim to half their assets
8815240 the law requires they treat people the same so thats a good principle to have in mind when they are drafting regulations

8815253 before he entered the white house abraham lincolns experience in elective office consisted of eight years in his state legislature in springfield ill

8815277 its all about excuses for past inaction excuses for past neglect excuses for past mismanagement mr ofarrell said
8815278 and an excuse that when we had record revenues instead of investing them in necessary infrastructure they failed to do so

8815286 all the governors need a partner in the white house and barack obama has promised us that he will in fact be a partner with us
8815287 weve sat down intimately with barack weve had dinner weve had discussions weve been on phone calls weve been talking about the problems were having state by state
8815288 president obama will have our federal government actually invest in things
8815289 i think that is the largest issue facing our country we dont have money to finance education or health care or infrastructure as long as we are sending a trillion dollars to those dictators to buy foreign oil
8815290 he wont stand by when bridges collapse while levees collapse
8815291 it wouldnt take the state out of providing dollars and services for health care but it would lessen the burden that we have right now since ive been governor the single biggest driver of our budget expansion has been increasing health care costs
8815292 i really believe if we get the nation going the right direction which i believe barack can do then we wont have as many unfunded mandates coming down to the states
8815293 i cant screw up oregon when it comes to intercollegiate sports but the school picked up a key win in mens basketball coach craig robinson happens to be the brother in law of democratic president nominee barack obama and used his prime time speaking slot on monday as any good coach would

8815308 sundays new york times magazine contained an excellent article by david leonhardt on obamas economic philosophy and policy strategy its a very long article 14 pages when you print it out and thats because it really does take that long to try to explain obamas thoughts on economic policy obamas approach is not stark rhetorical and uncomplicated its nuanced compromising and thoughtful
8815309 on every economic issue senator biden has voted for more taxes more spending and bigger government
8815310 biden is an avid supporter of pork barrel spending supporting the bridge to nowhere in 2005 and winning the ignominious porker of the month award from citizens against government waste in january 2002 biden has been reliably anti trade and pro government regulation

8815333 its the first obligation of any professional doctor to relieve pain said bernal
8815334 i just cant sit by while other people are in pain
8815335 theres a lot of old people in florida and they just need teeth and i dont know of any charity that helps them said bernal as he sat in his one bedroom apartment in a complex across from boca ratons city hall
8815336 they hear from a friend and they call me for some bridgework some repairs what am i supposed to do
8815337 they go to a dentist and dont get me wrong theyre not all greedy and they get charged 100 200 500 for work i can do relatively easy bernal said
8815338 i charge them maybe 25 of if they have a skill like woodworking i ask them to make something for me
8815339 there was no air conditioning there was no sterilization he was doing dentistry in a shack
8815340 i understand what mr bernal is saying that hes helping poor people it can cost a lot of money to have a tooth pulled even if you have insurance and hes charging people 20 or less for it
8815341 but hes putting people at huge risk risk for hepatitis spreading hiv cancer of the mouth
8815342 you go to the dentist and you get an x ray to see what the situation is before they pull your teeth he was pulling teeth with no x ray
8815343 people go to them because they know them or have heard they can get a procedure cheaper or they do better work than the expensive doctors said rosa 74 who had bridgework done by a doctor from her native cuba
8815344 with having to learn english it takes the doctors a long time to become doctors here
8815345 a lot of times you know these were great doctors in your country its not strange at all sometimes they can help you more than an american doctor
8815346 they the doctors have to be careful they are scared of getting caught but they do it because who else will help some of these people
8815347 there are hundreds of us in south florida colombians brazilians other south americans and we have all this skill and the ada american dental association wouldnt dream of certifying us bernal said
8815348 the cubans they stick together they brought all their patients over from cuba with them so its very hard for us to compete
8815349 it was very good equipment stuff youd find at a very good dentist and he couldnt take it back with him bernal explained
8815350 so he gave it to me it allowed me to do some procedures that are hard to do outside an office
8815351 were talking about people whod come in with hiv street people and they were never going to get anybody to treat them bernal said
8815352 id put on two sets of rubber gloves and treat them
8815353 now i understand a dentist has to pay for a secretary office space etc but the patient ends up paying for all that for example a denture maybe you spend 80 for materials they sell it for 2 000 how many people can afford that without insurance
8815354 in my mind i was out there helping people it was safe and it was sanitary whos going to help those people now

8815361 mccarthy era strategy of smear tactics and condemnation by association
8815362 struggled to find mentors in his search for a black identity

8815367 i say it with sadness but the truth is the government is not doing a thing to obtain the release of gilad shalit from captivity it is illogical that so much time has passed and he is still not home with his family

8815370 the chief need of our communion at the moment was the rebuilding of relationships the rebuilding of trust in one another and of confidence in our anglican identity how far the intensified sense of belonging together will help mutual restraint in such matters remains to be seen but it can be said that few of those who attended left without feeling they had in some respects moved and changed

8815396 this is an environment in which were likely to get a lot of head fakes both on the upside and the downside

8815421 housing may be the single most crucial element in survival and possible improvement yet it is almost impossible for people with mcs to find places to live that are truly safe for them
8815422 if i had chemical free housing i would be able to live i would be able to have a life instead of having to move every few months and getting sicker and sicker each time i would be able to contribute to the community and world if i didnt have to focus on my illness so much
8815423 if i had chemical free housing i would be able to be my optimum self and work
8815424 finding something that meets all the criteria required to be safe and still be affordable
8815425 lack of unscented well maintained and unrenovated properties in any price range far enough from neighbors dryer vents to be safe
8815426 i react to peoples scented products such as perfumes and cleaners as well as building materials such as treated wood floors rug etc
8815427 i think the biggest obstacle for me is mold money is also an obstacle it is hard to keep fragrances out too since they are on everything including grocery bags
8815428 fabric softener has become the biggest obstacle to me for safe housing
8815429 then i say the earth belongs to each of these generations during its course fully and in its own right the second generation receives it clear of the debts and encumbrances of the first the third of the second and so on for if the first could charge it with a debt then the earth would belong to the dead and not to the living generation then no generation can contract debts greater than may be paid during the course of its own existence
8815430 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8815431 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8815432 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8815433 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you can t afford to drive credit card bills you can t afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8815434 these challenges are not all of government s making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8815435 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8815436 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8815437 but the record s clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i don t know about you but i m not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8815438 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8815439 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8815440 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8815441 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8815442 that s the promise we need to keep that s the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8815443 change means a tax code that doesn t reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8815444 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8815445 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8815446 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8815447 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8815448 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8815449 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8815450 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power i ll help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america i ll make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and i ll invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can t ever be outsourced
8815451 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harm s way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home

8815458 i dont think one can tell if the deceased were a tobacco smoker or not by the appearance of the lungs the absence of any black pigment suggests that the person was either a nonsmoker or a very light smoker heavy black pigmentation suggests that the person was either a heavy smoker or lived in a city with heavy particulate air pollution or was a coal miner or some combination of the three the black pigment in question is elemental carbon which most investigators believe to be inert in its effects on the lungs although in the extremely heavy doses that coal miners used to get it may have had a partial role in coal workers lung disease

8815489 fight fans want to see someone who takes on a challenge
8815490 we were displeased with roys selection of another fighter who appears to have no hope against him
8815491 we all agreed that if this pay per view fight were a success roy would be allowed to go on fighting no hopers like julio and people who wanted to see roy fight in the future would be forced to pay to watch a fight that was in effect a glorified sparring match
8815492 i wanted to give gonzalez a closer look to see if he could contend with roy
8815493 it was obvious after just a couple minutes there was just no way its going to be another david telesco

8815598 today we subscribe to the alba to culture and to dignity to make hondurans a free people
8815599 honduras and the honduran people do not have to ask permission of any imperialism to join the alba
8815600 i did not come here to meddle in internal affairs but i am just reflecting and i cannot explain how a honduran could be against honduras joining the alba the path of development the path of integration
8815601 is the first summit in honduras and perhaps in the region where the witnesses are not only the top political leaders but also different sectors of the people who not only endorse the alba but also feel that an old historical debt is being paid
8815602 i have been looking for projects with the world bank the inter american development bank europe and i have found very prudent moderated responses
8815603 they do not have emergency funds and this obligates us to move toward new forms of finance like the alba

8815635 theyre all true and honest songs when i meet people after shows sometimes they think they know me because of a certain song and in a sense they do because i write about whats going on in my life it is scary making yourself vulnerable like that to a bunch of people you dont know but its also very therapeutic
8815636 i was always trying to find some medium to express myself
8815637 when i started writing songs i thought this is as honest as i can be getting onstage with my guitar and my voice and singing for people
8815638 these last two years i spent writing and writing and writing
8815639 i did feel this pressure on myself to top the first record
8815640 i still wanted to keep an intimate sound but i also knew i had to grow as an artist
8815641 so i opened myself up to robs production and he had a lot of great ideas we both had a really clear vision of what we wanted
8815642 reach only those with the level of culpability we usually require in order to impose criminal liability
8815643 shows the defendant attempted to escape conviction by deliberately closing his eyes to the obvious risk that he is engaging in unlawful conduct
8815644 denotes a conscious effort to avoid positive knowledge of a fact which is an element of an offense charged the defendant choosing to remain ignorant so he can plead lack of positive knowledge in the event he should be caught
8815645 dont tell me too much about the transaction i dont want to know
8815646 i f evidence proves the defendant actually knew an operant fact the same evidence could not also prove he was ignorant of that fact logic simply defies that result
8815647 should be used with caution because of the possibility that juries will convict on a basis akin to a standard of negligence
8815648 despite the instructions cautionary disclaimer there is a possibility that the jury will be led to employ a negligence standard and convict a defendant on the impermissible ground that he should have known an illegal act was taking place

8815650 while both types of pain can hurt very much at the time they occur social pain has the unique ability to come back over and over again whereas physical pain lingers only as an awareness that it was indeed at one time painful why arent we always suffering pain by recollections of social betrayal and other forms of social pain because we are pretty good at keeping these memories at bay

8815660 the next vice president of the united states joe biden
8815661 to malia and sasha i love you so much and i am so proud of you
8815662 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8815663 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8815664 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8815665 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8815666 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8815667 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8815668 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8815669 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8815670 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8815671 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8815672 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8815673 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8815674 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8815675 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8815676 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8815677 ill recruit an army of new teachers and pay them higher salaries
8815678 now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal days work because i want my daughters to have the same opportunities as your sons
8815679 fathers must take more responsibility to provide love and guidance to their children
8815680 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to be commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8815681 john mccain likes to say that hell follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8815682 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8815683 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons addition i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease and i will restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
8815684 so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8815685 what has also been lost is our sense of common purpose
8815686 if you dont have any fresh ideas then you use stale tactics to scare voters
8815687 i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring
8815688 the change we need doesnt come from washington it comes to washington
8815689 it is that promise that 45 years ago today brought americans from every corner of this land
8815690 for over two decades for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
8815691 and i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again that last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
8815692 if your hopes have been dashed again and again then its best to stop hoping and settle for what you already know
8815693 let us keep that promise that american promise and in the words of scripture hold firmly without wavering to the hope that we confess
8815694 yes i realize how early it is in the morning
8815695 based on our discussions it was determined that it would probably be in dr paxtons best interest and the colleges best interest that he resign as president
8815696 i havent changed my level of optimism around our business and and our ability to grow
8815697 the industry is still projecting double digit growth i still want to grow faster than the industry
8815698 if that were our intent we would not be working as feverishly as we are weve been going down a lot of avenues to emerge from bankruptcy
8815699 we received information that the suspect was involved in betting money on the fourth one day cricket match between india and sri lanka when our team raided his house kukreja was found taking bets on his mobile phones we also recovered a note book which has records of bets by 25 people totalling almost to rs five lakh

8815705 probably the most under recognized blog in the jblogsphere as far as i am concerned
8815706 the last hour would not come unless the muslims will fight against the jews and the muslims would kill them until the jews would hide themselves behind a stone or a tree and a stone or a tree would say muslim or the servant of allah there is a jew behind me come and kill him but the tree gharqad would not say for it is the tree of the jews
8815707 this is an important reminder that when free speech becomes a platform to encourage violence then it has crossed the line
8815708 we commend usc for having the moral courage to stand up against those who hijack speech and religious freedoms and the good will of the campus community in order to spread a message of hate and extremist violence
8815709 allah cursed the jews and the christians for they built the places of worship at the graves of their prophets
8815710 the hour will not be established until you fight with the jews and the stone behind which a jew will be hiding will say
8815711 o muslim there is a jew hiding behind me so kill him
8815712 the jews will fight with you and you will be given victory over them so that a stone will say o muslim
8815713 mark will be a guest on cnn friday morning at 8 40am
8815714 this follows every other technology that turns out to have information of forensic value i think what were seeing is evolutionary
8815715 what were dealing with here is a use of the technology that i dont think the good people at magellan or garmin or tomtom really thought about when they were developing it
8815716 were not going to let our food costs rise faster than our food budgets so if we can buy in bulk we can save in a per eating effect
8815717 overall these trends last a long period of time because consumers adjust their buying habits and they change their routine
8815718 i wanted to be able to buy in bulk when things were on sale or at a pretty good price and have the room to save and freeze and store anything that we can get at a good price
8815719 the participants underscore the need for respect of the historical and cultural traditions of each country and each people and for efforts aimed at preserving the unity of the state and its territorial integrity
8815720 the active role of russia in promoting peace and cooperation in the given region
8815721 whatever was going to blow away has already blown away
8815722 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
8815723 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent
8815724 it is simply impossible to determine exactly where and when gustav will make final landfall
8815725 the chances of hurricane force winds within the next five days are essentially the same at each individual location from the florida panhandle coast westward through the entire coastline of louisiana
8815726 its very very important that we play the way we practiced and trained over the last year and a half
8815727 and we cant afford to be in a disorganized way as we confront the challenges that were going to see here over the next five or six days
8815728 i need a moment to catch my breath and try to get my life back together
8815729 i watched her all week she was being tortured every day

8815737 he could be picked on if we introduced him into an established group
8815738 we are exploring the possibility of screening live the proceedings of the pmc general body on the internet the idea is at the planning stages but a few private companies have already come forward to give a demonstration
8815739 a circular has already been issued to all civic officers with an office laptop or a computer to install the software required for video conferencing there have been so far two training sessions to help ward officers use the facility
8815740 the videoconferencing facility will save a lot of time civic officers need no longer rush to meetings at long distances
8815741 there is some initial reluctance to use the facility it will take time implementation till the culture of using videoconferencing spread across the board there will be no officers who would like to go through traffic jams search for parking space and waste time to reach to the destination of a meeting when videoconferencing facility is an option
8815742 videoconferencing will be of most use to the general body standing committee and other committee meetings civic officers have to sit through meetings to reply to queries raised by elected representatives most of the time the officers have no role to play in the meeting and even they have it takes hardly a few minutes
8815743 computer infrastructure is an issue with the police stations hospitals and fire stations but in the pmc mahratta chamber of commerce industries and agriculture mccia has responded enthusiastically
8815744 they still wanted to be there raj goyle from the kansas state 87th district pointed out the importance of persistent grassroots work and remembering that our communities belong to us as much as any other residents

8815750 they need to rethink this once again its government intrusion in business a problem residents and businesses can solve themselves they think they can be big brother and step on our toes all the time
8815751 i just dont understand why when they have bands you have to listen to them 3 blocks down
8815752 unreasonable noise is a little ridiculous i can understand where some residents come from they do live within close proximity to where these bars play their music thats why a decimal level covers everybody
8815753 this is unprecedented this is something so exciting that obama is running for president in this day and time
8815754 you got the feeling he was transcendent almost a trans racial figure who can pull people together
8815755 it all depends on politicians but i think they will be here for a long time
8815756 we stayed away but now we have nowhere else to go we could not stay with relatives forever
8815757 at first we lived in fear and panic when the tanks and the militias came and burned some of the houses
8815758 now i am afraid they will never leave and life will never be what it was
8815759 it is hard for me to say it but it will take an enormous effort to get our territory back even beyond abkhazia and south ossetia

8815764 i try to be as real as possible i wouldnt try to fake it or go through the motions mechanically i try to live the character acting is a mix of instinct intelligence and common sense this role requires me to be a relaxed casual street smart guy not the guy who knows everything
8815765 since you didnt realise it i dont have to worry even if i go bald
8815766 well he first called to say congrats youve done a fantastic job do you think i can do this role i had to tell him how hes been the inspiration for me all these years and that if i can do it he would do a far better job than me he had no ego hassles talking to a younger star he could have managed it by himself but here he was asking me specifics on what trimmer i used for the line on the head he wanted me to be a part of the mahurat so i went to mumbai to watch the shoot actually he inspired me to get a six pack and the role over the last one and a half years hes like a brother to me i save all his messages i dubbed for vaal natchithiram the tamil version of taare zameen par i fully understood it only while dubbing it because i dont know hindi he was so touched that i didnt take money for it he got me a macbook air
8815767 you go to an acting school to know yourself or you can find ways to push yourselves and see what you can do i did peralagan to see how much i can push myself
8815768 i eat many little meals a day i try to avoid carbohydrates
8815769 it is unrealistic to maintain a six pack around the year i dont think it is healthy either it was one of the toughest things i couldnt eat rice or bread or milk products had to avoid even salt and stick to salad and chicken
8815770 as it is i have changed my name from saravanan to suriya i dont want another name i want to give a fresh experience to people every time they come to see me

8815774 it happened when we were not acting together i was basically her fan then i became her friend then co star
8815775 i think he won the night from the very first moment
8815776 if youre a republican operative a close adviser to president bush youre hoping that last night john kerry lays an egg
8815777 think about that for a moment african american families across america mothers and fathers and sons and daughters watching their television screens as for the first time in our unions history a black man will stand onstage and accept that nomination and all those mothers and fathers can say to their children look you can do that some day too so put aside politics for a moment and consider no matter who wins this election no matter where your allegiances lie barack obama is about to take a step forward not only for african americans but for all americans

8815781 i once knew someone who knew someone who immaced their eyebrows
8815782 i think there would be a lot more traffic that would come through here without a drawbridge
8815783 i couldnt imagine bringing in a boat that needed 60 feet span or more up through the intracoastal anyway
8815784 here they are covering the process of selecting the president and nobody is covering the actual president
8815785 we are in the process of reevaluating our relationship with russia
8815786 what if they gave a cold war and nobody came

8815790 they got exit stamps from the palestinian government they boarded the ships and soon theyll be in international waters and then in cyprus this is the first time ever that palestinians have been able to freely enter and leave their own country
8815791 if these were terrorists we would care but the fact is we allowed it
8815792 if anyone expects a regular flow of ships going back and forth this is not going to happen
8815793 hamas sent a message to arab countries who they feel arent doing anything saying these western activists managed to do what you havent been able to do for two years

8815797 our data seems to point toward the inherent decision that is made when the tumor is formed whether it is highly malignant or not moreover since the characteristic might be dependent on the normal cell status one might imagine that they might be different between individuals

8815882 he is fully aware of the opportunity that he has been given and he knows that this is an ongoing process

8815884 im very happy for adam hes proven everyone wrong hes got a very bright personal and professional future

8815904 well people its like that in washington too weve only got so much money in the national budget you can try to add some by raising taxes but youre already paying too much but you cant be foolish to cut the taxes of those most capable of paying either
8815905 once you know how much youve got to spend you really have one big decision to make
8815906 thats your choice america what will you be selfish or responsible should we pay to fulfill the american promise of social advancement for the vast majority of americans or should we maintain a vast military empire around the globe to protect and further the interests of a few
8815907 we cant afford both we have to choose thats what this election is all about it is about this choice its about how were gonna spend our money america
8815908 we spend close to a trillion dollars a year on defense related costs thats your money being spent do you know how much we could do with half of that money to fulfill the american promise to give you health care and education and environmentally safe energy plenty
8815909 but as long as we keep lavishly outfitting a military of a size we dont need social progress will remain a dream
8815910 well i say be not afraid be not afraid we can cut our defense spending in half and wed still have a military fives times bigger than russias or chinas with those savings we can begin to deliver the american promise
8815911 we dont have enemies to justify spending so much on defense
8815912 be not afraid i say we have a choice to make like the one you make at your kitchen table what are we going to spend our limited funds on war or the peoples needs
8815913 we can choose to improve the lives of millions of people or kill huge numbers of people do we want to support life on a mass scale or death on that scale
8815914 we will hear about when hes broken ranks with his party but the records clear 90 of the time hes voted with george bush
8815915 weve heard about mccains good judgment what does it say about judgment when you think george bush is right 90 of the time
8815916 anything but independent his advisor said it was a mental recession and that weve become a nation of whiners
8815917 i dont think mccain doesnt care i think he just doesnt know
8815918 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because he doesnt get it
8815919 pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you dont have boots
8815920 same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result
8815921 you dont defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying iraq
8815922 mccain said hes follow him osama bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8815923 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8815924 i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain
8815925 this is the party of roosevelt the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country or keep us safe
8815926 if you dont have any fresh ideas then you use stale tactics to scare voters if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone to run from
8815927 i dont fit the typical pedigree i havent spent my career in the halls of washington but i stand here tonight because all across america something is stirring this election has never been about me its about you
8815928 american promise is the freedom to make of our own lives what we want but we also have obligations to treat each other with dignity and respect
8815929 government must do what we cannot do for ourselves protect us from harm provide education keep our water and toys safe invest in new technologies government should work for us not against us help us not hurt us
8815930 government cant turn off the tv so that a little girl does her homework fathers must take on more responsibility
8815931 i know these things cost money and i have laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing loopholes and tax havens
8815932 one of the groups leaders william ayers admits to the bombings proudly saying later we didnt do enough
8815933 weather fugitive is seized in killings associated press 4 17 08 new york times 10 22 81 but barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as respectable and mainstream
8815934 the reason we responded to it was because of the fact that they were actually spending money on an attack that we werent going to let remain unanswered folks arent going to lie about barack obama without forceful response
8815935 we definitely expected the ad to generate discussion in the battleground states of michigan ohio pennsylvania and virginia in which it aired but the attention drawn from the obama campaign the media and american voters has quickly raised this story to the national level
8815936 sen obamas heavy handed response to the ad has definitely misfired and the more the obama campaign attempts to bully the ad off the air with legal threats and intimidation the more voters are wondering what he has to hide
8815937 is it a mistake to respond to a meaningless ad from a fringe group
8815938 its important to emphasize that building ones emotional intelligence can not
8815939 in washington they call this you are on your own
8815940 a government that sits on its hands while a major american city drowns before our eyes
8815941 a plan that would privatize social security and gamble your retirement
8815942 if i were a good moderate to conservative war supporting american who knew nothing about the candidates except what i learned in this debate id vote for kerry
8815943 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8815944 this country of ours has more wealth than any nation
8815945 the day those tests came in we realized we had a serial killer on our hands who has been active for 23 years
8815946 everything dried up they ran out of clues they got on to other things
8815947 we cannot be so arrogant to think that everything this guy has ever done came with an lapd crime report attached to it
8815948 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8815949 washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8815950 im a former vice president and ill give the speech ill give

8815954 what the hell have i been doing for the last year
8815955 she should be transferred to bellevue hospital for urgent medical and psychological treatment
8815956 she has been significantly traumatized and she needs immediate help
8815957 any suggestion that the cia would imprison her children is wrong and offensive
8815958 we do know she was at bagram for a long time
8815959 it was a long time according to my client she was there for years and she was held in american custody her treatment was horrendous
8815960 of course they found all this stuff on her it was planted on her she is the ultimate victim of the american dark side
8815961 the violation of the rights of dr siddiqui and her children and countless other missing persons is squarely the responsibility of the government of pakistan there is enough evidence indicating that she was initially picked up by the intelligence agencies in pakistan therefore not only the government of the united states but also the government of pakistan must be made accountable for the crime
8815962 i find it extremely troubling that a parent would say the things he wrote in those messages
8815963 maybe all obama has to offer is inspiration hope feelings not policies or years of political pedigree
8815964 death and life are in the power of the tongue
8815965 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
8815966 as far as i know we dont publish response and refusal rates we conducted the poll for the associated press youd have to ask them about releasing the response and refusal rates
8815967 we dont have them here from ipsos it takes a little while for them to get those to us i can ask them it shouldnt take too long but normally it takes a few days theyre not secret or anything
8815968 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
8815969 a reasonable approximation for the response rate on the economist wave of august 4 6 would be 43 the opt out rate from our mailings was 4 my best guess at a comparable statistic to refusal
8815970 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
8815971 the idaho delegation sitting right next to the jones street boys
8815972 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8815973 and now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal days work because i want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons
8815974 i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
8815975 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8815976 i didnt know what i wanted for the country before now but now i realize that barack obama is the only person who can bring pride back to america
8815977 and thats to be expected because if you dont have any fresh ideas then you use stale tactics to scare the voters if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from
8815978 i dont know how john mccain thinks celeberties lives are like but thats my life

8815983 since tests havent begun yet we dont know what the ailment is
8815984 he comes every six months for a routine checkup around a month ago a checkup was conducted and he was in perfect health
8815985 sin is the disease of the soul and such a disease as will if the soul is not benumbed cause exceeding pain sin brings guilt and that brings condemnation and wrath all this trouble arises from conviction of sin awakened sinners are convinced that they are sinful before the sinner thought well of himself or was not convinced that he was very sinful but now he is led to reflect first on what he has done and how wickedly he has spent his time and what wicked acts or practices he has been guilty of and afterwards in the progress of his awakenings he is made sensible of something of the sin and plague of his heart they are made sensible of the guilt and wrath which sin brings the threatenings of gods law are set home and they are made sensible that god is angry and that his wrath is dreadful they are led to consider of the dreadfulness of that punishment which god has threatened the affection is fear why does god allow us to feel fear later in the sermon it is that the soul may be prepared for a confiding application of itself to christ for comfort it is the will of god that men should have true hope and comfort conferred upon them in no other way than by jesus christ it is only by him that sinners have comfort at their conversion and it is by him only that the saints have renewed hope and comfort after the declensions and therefore the way to obtain this comfort is to look to him to fly for refuge to him and in order to this persons have need to be brought to a sense of their necessity of him and that they may be so it is needful that they should be in trouble and be brought to see their utter helplessness in themselves and not only natural men but christians also who are fallen into sin and are in a dead and senseless frame need something to make them more sensible of their necessity of christ
8815986 in my fathers house are many rooms if it were not so would i have told you that i go to prepare a place for you and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and will take you to myself that where i am you may be also
8815987 the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit a broken and contrite heart o god you will not despise
8815988 im a consumer justice attorney and i represent john hooks a merchant marine not some fancy company not some conglomerate
8815989 we believe that the 12 executions were an isolated incident and not part of a strategy to destabilise the state guzman told reporters
8815990 the dodgers have lost seven straight and their nine consecutive road losses are the most since dropping 11 in a row in june 1992
8815991 i knew i need a triple so as soon as i hit the ball im going to go to third
8815992 they were going all crazy and i was just thinking about boone a little bit
8815993 but as soon as he hit the ball everybody was go three go three go three all the way
8815994 i didnt know what was going on until everybody went to screaming
8815995 i was just trying to sit there and get some air or whatever and i look at the board because everybody was screaming in the dugout and i was like oh thats why so i went to screaming too
8815996 you get that two run lead in the first inning its kind of the last thing you want to do is give up runs especially that many
8815997 we have to go out there and win a ball game to start making us feel good right now it doesnt feel too good
8815998 it was just a great feeling in a season full of some not so happy memories
8815999 weve been playing well of late and its just good to see smiles on everyones face
8816000 we have to put mechanisms in place that will not only allow a sustained ceasefire but will also help avoid reoccurrence of violent incidents
8816001 here in darfur there are similarities of course because here you have people who seem to be marginalized who want to be more developed but the difficulty here is the interference and outside interference in the darfur conflict so it is a little bit complicated but we will try
8816002 maybe coz we are the other extreme and feel there might be something to it
8816003 this is related to one of the central problems of philosophy
8816004 physician heal thyself and for that learn to be a physician
8816005 the solution we think is to end the age of disposable plastic like plastic bags water bottles single use plastics have no use in modern society
8816006 there is a god how the most notorious atheist changed his mind
8816007 why do i believe this given that i expounded and defended atheism for more than a half century the short answer is this this is the world picture as i see it that has emerged from modern science science spotlights three dimensions of nature that point to god the first is that nature obeys rational laws the second is the dimension of life of intelligently organized and purpose driven beings which arose from matter third is the very existence of of nature but it is not science alone that has guided me i have also been helped by a renewed study of classical philosophical arguments
8816008 even the most atheistic scientist accepts as an act of faith the existence of a law like order in nature
8816009 the fine tuning has been explained in two ways some scientists have said the fine tuning is evidence for divine design many others have speculated that our universe is one of multiple others a multi universe with the difference that ours happened to have the right conditions for life virtually no major scientists today claims that the fine tuning was purely a result of chance factors at work in a single universe
8816010 the universe was brought into existence by an infinite intelligence
8816011 what i think the dna material has done is that it has shown by almost unbelievable complexity of the arrangements which are needed to produce life that intelligence must have been involved in getting these extraordinarily diverse elements to work together it is the enormous complexity of the number of elements and the enormous subtlety of the ways they work together the meeting of these two parts at the right time by chance is simply minute it is all a matter of the enormous complexity by which the results were achieved which looked to me the work of intelligence
8816012 those scientists einstein newton boyle hawking davies planck etc who point to the mind of god do not merely advance a series of arguments or processes of syllogistic reasoning rather they propound a vision of reality that emerges from conceptual heart of modern science and imposes itself on the rational mind it is a vision that i personally find compelling and irrefutable
8816013 have built a philosophically compelling vision of a rational universe that sprang from a divine mind
8816014 the presence or absence of a creative super intelligence is unequivocally a scientific question
8816015 genes of course can be neither selfish nor unselfish any more than they or any other non conscious entities can engage in competition or make selections
8816016 does not positively produce anything it only eliminates or tends to eliminate whatever is not competitive
8816017 to let preconceived theories shape the way we view evidence
8816018 i never dreamed i would walk again after i was wounded i forgot what its like only when standing up can i feel how tall i really am and speak to people eye to eye not from below

8816058 is pleased that the court agreed with our position that plaintiffs failed to state a viable antitrust claim against our company we continue to feel that the plaintiffs related suits also lack merit and we intend to vigorously defend against them as well

8816064 there is an economic and a credit crunch going on right now and its all related

8816074 we were changing the world was changing the church was changing
8816075 all of a sudden we had this retreat center what were we going to do with it
8816076 now we can open up to all these other faiths none of which have retreat centers
8816077 the trick was to help these institutions understand the gift they would get from coming to a spiritual center that it stood for more than just making a buck
8816078 the more people started coming the more folks began talking about this special place in montecito
8816079 la casa has this ability to hold a problem like a hurting child
8816080 it was developed to begin a dialogue between traditional catholics and non catholics but once people started talking their religious backgrounds became irrelevant
8816081 im sure it stunned some the first time i walked into city hall and threw my arms around 16 people and visa versa
8816082 and its not always a good idea to treat a family legally
8816083 we were listening from a nonprofit standpoint and they were talking from a business standpoint
8816084 we were going to do everything in our power to make sure that spiritual retreats continued on that property preferably under the ihc
8816085 what caused the real grief was to mortgage el bosque and then take the money and put it into something else that was morally wrong
8816086 we bent over backward to try to be fair to both sides
8816087 i was a director of an independent nonprofit i had creditors and a mission we could share the value of that property but i couldnt just give away the assets
8816088 ever since the 1960s the democratic party has been the party for college students
8816089 we have a great candidate and a great party there is so much excitement on campus and so many new voters and a lot are registering democrat
8816090 we try to offer more education on the issues of the candidates their morals and values rather than just plaster posters up everywhere
8816091 we are installing three new speakers to the audible alert system
8816092 one will target the brickyard while one targets the paul derr track and one targets centennial campus

8816096 to see him get hit in the head you know its not a good thing
8816097 they were on top of it and you have to give the south carolina team a lot of credit because they helped too
8816098 i just told them hes in medical hands and hes in gods hands
8816099 to see a guy out there like that its hard but the hangover from that wasnt why we lost today
8816100 other than losing a great player i dont think there was an emotional hangover that caused us to lose
8816101 we didnt have any room for a standby line adjacent to the student entrance
8816102 the rbc center had space available indoors for 500 people
8816103 there will be signs directing students to it and they will meet at the south plaza starting 90 minutes prior to kickoff
8816104 if you have a ticket you should get there by kickoff
8816105 if anything i think itd be sooner than 15 minutes for the standby line to go
8816106 the only reason someone should have to use a standby line is if a game is completely sold out to students or they could not get a ticket before six hours before the game
8816107 the end result is going to be a better game atmosphere that rewards the more loyal fans
8816108 although well be sure we dont alienate any students that have emergency circumstances that interfere with the game
8816109 this game was a chance to show what we had
8816110 the defense played well but we still have a long way to go if were going to be a good acc team
8816111 i believe in students and i believe they want to do the right thing in the world
8816112 they cant give 15 minutes to make their students better citizens
8816113 the new players have come in and gelled well and weve filled in some missing pieces

8816115 shes the type of kid that can step in and help us right away
8816116 we dont talk about wins and losses we just take care of what takes place on our side of the court
8816117 the nice thing about playing carolina is that its such a rivalry that both teams are equal no matter which team is stronger during the year
8816118 the acc is stronger this year than last year because several teams are returning key players we know we havent done well in the conference but well take it one match at a time
8816119 pray especially for rulers and their governments to rule well so we can be quietly about our business of living simply in humble contemplation
8816120 but its still just a hobby so i dont care about turnover

8816129 nella dichiarazione riguardante le spiegazioni della carta dei diritti fondamentali che secondo lart
8816130 la morte non si considera cagionata in violazione del presente articolo se e il risultato di un ricorso alla forza resosi assolutamente necessario
8816131 uno stato puo prevedere nella propria legislazione la pena di morte per atti commessi in tempo di guerra o in caso di pericolo imminente di guerra tale pena sara applicata solo nei casi previsti da tale legislazione e conformemente alle sue disposizioni
8816132 sommosse o insurrezioni possono essere viste anche in certe dimostrazioni secondo il trattato di lisbona luso mortale di armi da fuoco in tali situazioni non rappresenta una violazione del diritto alla vita in guerra si trovano attualmente sia la germania che laustria le guerre dellunione europea aumenteranno per questo lunione si riarma anche con il trattato di lisbona
8816133 la prassi dellunione di estendere estremamente i testi sui doveri degli stati membri non autorizza ad escludere anche una tale interpretazione quando la situazione lo comanda o lo consiglia
8816134 non mi stanchero mai di ribadirlo il sindacato non difende fannulloni e lavoratori scorretti che peraltro danneggiano prima di tutto i propri colleghi abbiamo ben chiaro qual e il giusto equilibrio tra rivendicazione dei diritti e rispetto dei doveri cosi come lesigenza di lasciarci alle spalle ogni esperienza di sindacato consociativo ma ora ci troviamo di fronte ad un clima esagerato come a voler scaricare sui lavoratori la responsabilita delle cose che non vanno nel paese e che nel caso delle fs sono una politica generale del trasporto sbagliata linefficienza dei servizi lassenza di trasferimenti da parte dello stato la minaccia della concorrenza
8816135 se e stato alterato il rapporto tra ore lavorate e timbratura del cartellino si tratta di uninfrazione grave passibile di licenziamento se invece i lavoratori hanno solo chiesto ai colleghi di timbrare al posto loro il cartellino ma senza assentarsi dal lavoro allora si tratta di un caso che andrebbe affrontato con sanzioni meno pesanti
8816136 li qualcosa evidentemente non torna come dimostrano anche le reazioni degli schieramenti politici e degli osservatori imparziali come fanno cipolletta e moretti a parlare di lesione dellimmagine dellazienda quando i veri problemi sono altri che dire allora della pulizia dei treni e delle inefficienze del servizio come si fa a licenziare una persona che magari esagerando non fa altro che difendere gli interessi degli utenti e se poi accade un incidente che fine fa davvero limmagine dellazienda la linea adottata dai vertici delle fs inverte causa ed effetto ed e controproducente anche se mi sembra dettata dalla voglia di spostare lattenzione dai problemi reali
8816137 guardi le fs sono passate nel giro di pochi anni da 200mila a meno di 100mila dipendenti e stata la piu grande ristrutturazione aziendale nella storia del paese ed e stata fatta con il consenso del sindacato se ora lesigenza e quella di diffondere il piu possibile la cultura del dovere mi chiedo perche non si cerchi un rapporto positivo con i sindacati piuttosto che risolvere il tutto sul fronte degli attacchi individuali
8816138 gia ho detto come la penso sul ruolo del sindacato nella lotta ai fannulloni e alle irregolarita daltro canto nella pubblica amministrazione i licenziamenti di lavoratori per giusta causa ci sono sempre stati senza che nel paese si scatenassero particolari dibattiti ma ora esiste un clima generale alimentato da anni di campagna ideologica contro la pubblica amministrazione motivata in fondo dagli interessi di chi vuole mettere in discussione i servizi pubblici a partire dalla sanita e dalla scuola
8816139 e vero lesecutivo tende a minimizzare ma sara un autunno difficile dopo la pubblicazione dei pessimi dati sul pil nella ue molti governi europei hanno interrotto le ferie per riunioni durgenza sulle contromisure da adottare di fronte alla crisi il nostro invece non ha dato segni di vita davanti ai venti di recessione dimostra che lunica cosa che gli sta a cuore e il federalismo mi dispiace anche per lenfasi dimostrata dal ministro sacconi per i dati sullaumento delle ore di straordinario determinato dalla defiscalizzazione in realta il vero problema e lo spaventoso incremento delle ore di cassa integrazione nelle aziende il fatto e che le misure del governo nel breve periodo hanno effetti depressivi perche non sostengono i redditi e gli investimenti oltre a tagliare fondi per settori chiave come la ricerca e linnovazione
8816140 in effetti ci sono forti rischi per la coesione sociale con laumento della precarieta per i giovani e lulteriore abbandono del sud noi chiediamo al governo di cambiare la politica economica con un vero sostegno al reddito di famiglie e pensionati detrazioni al lavoro dipendente restituzione del fiscal drag lindicazione che arrivera la valuteremo unitariamente con cisl e uil e chiaro che riteniamo necessarie risposte nel segno dello sviluppo e della giustizia sociale le prossime settimane saranno decisive
8816141 fastidioso avere missili puntati a pochi km dalla propria casa ce lo ricorda la crisi dei missili a cuba quando gli americani impedirono con un blocco navale in acque internazionali un atto di guerra alle navi sovietiche di portare a cuba i missili nel quadro di un accordo tra i due paesi comunisti

8816143 il maggior problema della giustizia e che ce troppa gente in carcere

8816151 siamo fortemente preoccupati di quanto sta avvenendo nel nostro paese tanto piu nel contesto di un dibattito sulla sicurezza caratterizzato da toni e contenuti che ricordano periodi cupi della storia ditalia e deuropa la decisione di prendere le impronte digitali ai bambini rom ha suscitato giusta indignazione e ha rivelato se ancora ce ne fosse stato bisogno la vera faccia di una politica asservita soltanto agli interessi dei ricchi e dei potenti
8816152 complice una strategia mediatica disattenta alle esigenze dei piu poveri
8816153 fondate sulla garanzia delle armi e dellesercito sulla penalizzazione di alcune categorie di persone e sulla crescita del controllo con la conseguente limitazione del diritto alla riservatezza della sfera personale
8816154 si alimenta un giudizio negativo nei confronti di tutti gli immigrati irregolari ed unombra su tutti gli stranieri si avallano pregiudizi inaccettabili verso tutti i nomadi e cosi via
8816155 siano varati evocando lidentita e le radici cristiane in modo ideologico capzioso ed evidentemente strumentale
8816156 il dibattito in corso e inquietante per i suoi tratti disumani nei confronti dei diversi degli stranieri e dei nomadi e per la sistematica identificazione tra i problemi e le persone tra la soluzione delle questioni ed il rifiuto la ghettizzazione o lespulsione
8816157 anche in chi si dichiara cristiano e frequenta la chiesa

8816161 nel momento in cui la chiesa contesta giustamente il reato di clandestinita dovrebbe contemporaneamente ampliare di molto la disponibilita allaccoglienza nelle tante strutture di sua proprieta esse potrebbero essere gestite in collaborazione fra volontariato e istituzioni pubbliche diventando cosi unalternativa concreta e sostenibile alla detenzione nei cpt

8816166 il governo doveva decidere anno per anno cosa fosse reato e cosa no il che prefigura un attentato anche piu grave alla giustizia bene qualcuno ha dei dubbi sulla categoria nella quale sarebbero alloggiati i reati di falso in bilancio e gli altri reati societari o quelli di frode fiscale o quelli di corruzione o quelli di abuso edilizio o quelli di abuso di ufficio mi viene in mente anche il reato di finanziamento illecito dei partiti politici ma quasi non lo scrivo perche mi viene da ridere ndv gia b disse che intendeva depenalizzare la bancarotta fraudolente dopo aver depenalizzato il falso in bilancio reati per cui in usa per es si prendono anche 30 anni di carcere affidare alla classe politica la scelta dei reati da non perseguire produrrebbe in automatico una lista dei reati tipici della classe politica stessa sicche si vede bene che abbandonare il principio dellobbligatorieta dellazione penale puliamo tutta la casa e adottare quello della non obbligatorieta ne puliamo solo alcune stanze e una scelta complicata e pero puo anche darsi che sia necessaria ma allora prima vediamolo se e proprio necessaria il processo penale e lunghissimo troppo dice con ragione la pattuglia di senatori allora rendiamolo piu corto ci avete provato avete nominato i giudici necessari bandendo i relativi concorsi restano scoperti circa 1500 posti no vero avete assunto il personale amministrativo che manca il 30 dei funzionari amministrativi no vero avete comprato computer stampanti fotocopiatrici autovetture sistemi informatici moderni insomma quello che serve per lavorare no vero allora perche prima di lasciare sporca meta della casa non provate a procurarvi le risorse necessarie per tenerla pulita tutta ma perche mi pare di sentirli mica viviamo nel paese dei puffi noi tutti questi soldi non li abbiamo e magari hanno ragione allora proviamo con le soluzioni che non costano niente avete ridisegnato le circoscrizioni giudiziarie e abolito piu o meno la meta dei tribunali e delle procure italiane anche questo no eh eppure lo sapete che otterreste un sacco di risorse in piu per far funzionare quelli che restano e che risparmiereste anche un sacco di soldi eh ma come si fa con gli amministratori locali compagni di partito che non ne vogliono sapere di far perdere alla loro citta il tribunale magari perdono qualche voto e gli avvocati delle piccole citta dove li mettiamo anche loro sono elettori mi rendo conto avete previsto un diverso regime delle notifiche per esempio lobbligo per ogni avvocato di avere un indirizzo e mail e la validita delle notifiche effettuate in questo modo cosi si risparmiano gli ufficiali giudiziari avete previsto lobbligo per ogni imputato di eleggere domicilio presso il suo avvocato cosi non dobbiamo fare i salti mortali per trovarlo ogni volta e rinviare il relativo processo avete previsto labolizione del processo dappello per tutti non solo in caso di appello del pubblico ministero che diamine accusa e difesa con pari diritti lo dite sempre eppure dovreste sapere che nella maggior parte dei paesi occidentali che vengono sempre portati ad esempio in genere a sproposito quando conviene il processo dappello non esiste avete previsto la depenalizzazione di quei reati che potrebbero essere puniti con una multa ad opera di vigili urbani asl ufficio delle imposte inps etc dalla sosta con il tagliando falsificato allomesso versamento delle ritenute inps avete previsto una delle decine di riforme che qualsiasi magistrato e in grado di indicarvi che non costerebbero niente farebbero risparmiare soldi e renderebbero celere il processo dimenticavo senza toccare le garanzie difensive per carita siamai che un colpevole abbia meno chances di scamparla ma certo che non avete fatto nulla di tutto questo allora perche decidere di lasciare meta della casa sporca senza prima sbattersi per vedere come e possibile tenerla pulita sara che in quelle stanze buie e non frequentate qualcuno ci si trovera bene

8816174 la piu grande campagna pubblicitaria allaperto mai vista in cina
8816175 le edizioni dei giochi olimpici hanno piu volte significato o coinciso con o tollerato violazioni di diritti umani civili e politici arrivando talvolta ad una vera e propria immedesimazione con crudeli regimi dittatoriali
8816176 quando ce stato il terremoto che ha colpito le province del sud est della cina la prima preoccupazione delle autorita non e stata quella di soccorrere le persone rimaste sepolte sotto le macerie ma di occultare i fatti per paura di scoraggiare gli investitori stranieri e il segnale di una modalita ancora feudale di concepire il potere pubblico a fronte di una modernizzazione economica senza precedenti
8816177 quando un atleta partecipa a questi eventi internazionali si esprime attraverso lattivita agonistica ma non puo cessare di esistere come uomo ed evitare che il suo cervello continui a ragionare e a porsi delle domande latleta e in primo luogo una persona e un cittadino e deve essere libero di poter esprimere tranquillamente le proprie opinioni sono pertanto assolutamente contrario a quei provvedimenti che sono stati minacciati da parte di alcune federazioni verso gli atleti che manifesteranno pubblicamente le loro posizioni durante i giochi olimpici di pechino ricordo ad esempio i clamorosi gesti di tommie smith e john carlos alle olimpiadi del messico nel 1968 questi atleti hanno pagato duramente la loro coraggiosa presa di posizione lhanno pagata con la sospensione dalla squadra americana di atletica lespulsione dal villaggio olimpico e la successiva emarginazione da parte dellambiente dello sport considero molto grave quello che e accaduto a questi atleti perche nessuno puo essere privato della liberta di esprimere le proprie opinioni e le idee in cui crede questo e proprio cio che dovrebbe distinguere la nostra cultura da quelle che non rispettano i diritti umani e la liberta di espressione
8816178 compito dello sport dovrebbe essere aprire formare far crescere migliorare una persona e dunque un controsenso chiedere a unatleta di rinnegare la propria persona nel momento in cui si cimenta in una competizione sportiva per quanto devo ammettere che queste competizioni hanno ormai poco a che fare con il senso profondo dello sport mentre hanno molto a che fare con il business

8816204 there will be claims that they are not really a topless bar that they have certain anatomical parts covered that they are really in the business of selling booze and so you have to have a certain level of undercover work to be able to show that

8816246 if inflation continues to accelerate at this pace we are heading toward 3 or perhaps even in excess of 3 which is an absolutely unheard of level of inflation in japan and it has evolved to that very rapidly

8816262 the collapse of zoom is a result of matter beyond our control only last year zoom airlines made profit but that turned into a loss in the last year due to the unprecedented increase in the price of aviation fuel and the economic climate
8816263 the price of oil resulted in our fuel bill jumping by nearly 50 million in one year and we could not recover that from passengers who had already booked their flights

8816294 snow takes full advantage of his films system of discourse to twit restless audiences a lot of this is pretty funny but so is this is more than a series of gags snow manages to defamiliarize both film and language creating a kind of moving concrete poetry while throwing a monkey wrench into a theoretical debate is film a language that has been going on sporadically for 60 years if you let it snows film stretches your definition of what film is thats cinema and so is this

8816319 es inevitable que en un punto se deban retener hembras porque si no dejar amos de ser productores de carne ese momento va a ser cr tico porque el gap de diferencial necesario para mantener la cantidad de carne a un precio justo necesariamente se va a tener que cubrir con cortes importados y subsidiados porque los valores en el exterior son mucho m s altos que los que se manejan en el mercado dom stico

8816335 approximately 12 million people a year in the u s seek medical care for impacted or excessive cerumen
8816336 this leads to nearly 8 million cerumen removal procedures by health care professionals developing practical clinical guidelines for physicians to understand the harm vs benefit profile of the intervention was essential
8816337 unfortunately many people feel the need to manually remove cerumen from the ears
8816338 this can result in further impaction and other complications to the ear canal
8816339 the complications from cerumen impaction can be painful and ongoing including infections and hearing loss
8816340 it is hoped that these guidelines will give clinicians the tools they need to spot an issue early and avoid serious outcomes
8816341 recent in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that a single genetic event in the map kinase signaling pathway may be sufficient for thyroid cell transformation and tumor development
8816342 thyroid cancer is associated with exposure to external or internal ionizing radiation elucidation of mechanisms of radiation induced cancer in humans especially early steps and pathways has potential implications for epidemiological risk analyses early clinical diagnosis and chemopreventive interventions
8816343 that means that a younger person living close to the bombing site would be more likely to have adult onset thyroid cancer having ret ptc rearrangements
8816344 it could be either by direct dna damage or by other pathways such as a result of radiation induced genomic instability

8816384 what do we see of a topic in the complete picture impression of jesus life
8816385 i just paid two billion for him to learn a lesson after the after action report it was apparent that he had learned something and that i might as well be the one who benefits from it i paid for the experience after all
8816386 this would allow the city to better check to ensure that associated revenues are being properly reported for business license purposes
8816387 if they pass that then i will have to find out who owns the property
8816388 i thought it was the consensus of council to improve the image of the city
8816389 you arent improving the image of the city with them popping up on every corner
8816390 the two this week both of them are similar mos and are being investigated by arson investigators
8816391 were asking for the public to be vigilant and notify us of any suspicious activity
8816392 can you please call ahead to make sure the plane does not leave it takes off in 15 minutes
8816393 i tried to check my bag this isnt a carry on they are telling me to take it on the plane
8816394 god forbid lord no such thing shall ever happen to you
8816395 get behind me satan you are an obstacle to me you are thinking not as god does but as human beings do
8816396 whoever wishes to come after me must deny himself take up his cross and follow me for whoever wishes to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it what profit would there be for one to gain the whole world and forfeit his life or what can one give in exchange for his life for the son of man will come with his angels in his fathers glory and then he will repay all according to his conduct
8816397 no that came out wrong what i meant to say was how do you feel about doing some spanking shots
8816398 the way i have you posed here leaning over the arm of the couch with your uh your ass in the air it looks as if youre waiting for a spanking all we have to do is make it a little more obvious
8816399 id have to pull down your panties to show your bare ass and we might have to spread your legs a little bit more we dont really have to show much more than a little skin just a hint of sex and let the imagination do the rest what do you think
8816400 yes i want to do them the shots i mean
8816401 now keeley im going to pull down your panties but not any more than you want me to we can show just a little bit of your ass or we can show a lot it all depends on how comfortable you are let me know when you want me to stop okay
8816402 very good now we just need to work on your stance a little bit
8816403 relax and arch your back for me just going to spread your legs a little more to get the best shot
8816404 this pose shows a lot and i need to know if youre comfortable with that is this what you want
8816405 this guy is good and he latches himself onto as many sources and people as he can
8816406 in all my years of working drug cases he is probably one of the smartest cats ive seen
8816407 we knew this was a complex ongoing operation and our goal was to build a stronger case to move forward
8816408 i know nothing else about him other than what you see there
8816409 he has always been open and willing to assist anyone in need
8816410 eppure dovrai metterti lanimo in pace replic woland e un sorriso beffardo distorse la sua bocca
8816411 we are doing this as a means of keeping our daughters spirit alive
8816412 theyre suspected of being involved in most of the delivery driver and cab driver robberies in that area
8816413 whether theyre actually charged in all those robberies remains to be seen
8816414 a company must go out and find what the customer wants the need is not for say half a million inch drill bits the needs is that there are ten million inch holes that need to be drilled
8816415 they say rome wasnt built in a day i wasnt on that job
8816416 how to recover files if youve screwed your osx install with target disc mode
8816417 gee that email loaded really quickly and the images are all in place and html emails dont look like crap and saving attachments isnt convoluted and character encodings dont get mis interpreted all the time
8816418 a company must go out and find what the customer wants the need is not for say half a million inch drill bits the needs is that there are ten million inch holes that need to be drilled
8816419 were doing this basically at the request of the mayor so when the council voted that he not go to washington to testify there was no reason to do it
8816420 we appreciate congressman browns recall of his legislation which was very bad for the environment and very bad for the taxpayers
8816421 the public should understand that the recent media controversy on this matter was nothing more than negative politics as usual weeks before an election orchestrated by ms ketners campaign in a deliberate attempt to damage the congressmans outstanding reputation
8816422 the first story on this came out on a monday we did not get into the fray immediately because we wanted to give the residents of kiawah those most affected by the legislation an opportunity to respond our first press release went out that friday only because so many angry people contacted our office and asked linda to speak up about it on their behalf
8816423 decided to do the right thing and can understand why hes embarrassed
8816424 a victory for those who spoke out against special interest groups and for the protection of the coast of south carolina
8816425 im in love with someone in a book how crazy is that
8816426 are we changing administrations yes but are we gonna have substantial changes in government and go in the right direction i think thats going to happen under john mccain
8816427 mccain knows we need to go after our own resources at the same time we look for alternative fuels and environmentally sensitive fuels we need to drill people know it at the pump and everyday lives
8816428 but very few experts believe if he were on the ticket hed be able to deliver minnesota for mccain
8816429 all you do is work out you dont even get paid for it
8816430 its the best of all possible worlds for a politician
8816431 have not served a red america or a blue america they have served a united states of america
8816432 i wanted to be with people that had my hopes and dreams
8816433 what i like about this campaign not just with me being an african american is what this election could mean not just for this country but all over the world
8816434 i think thats what its going to take for some of us locals to get elected we need to take advantage of the obama phenomena
8816435 this is the first time in a long long time that ive been able to be for a candidate instead of choosing between the best of the rest
8816436 i think he needs to reach out to the working class people those making less than 50 000 a year
8816437 o painel sobre imprensa poderia salvar do inevit vel mergulho na nulidade o semin rio de veja se reinaldo azevedo fosse ali designado para enfrentar o ex ministro m rcio thomaz bastos na quest o do controle estatal da m dia
8816438 i think that 3 to 5 feet is a conservative estimate for coastal management here
8816439 dont let anybody back you into a corner that its a nuclear plant or nothing because its simply not true
8816440 just last week i had to wade in the water to get back to charleston development academy
8816441 if we had the money we could start next year
8816442 we can give county council good information that will bring real economic development to charleston county
8816443 the whole accommodations fee allocation process in my mind has been a nightmare
8816444 if you dont eat something ill have lili make you

8816453 john mccain votou com george bush 90 das vezes o senador mccain gosta de dizer que tem crit rio mas o que realmente dep e sobre seu crit rio foi pensar que george bush esteve certo 90 das vezes
8816454 n o sei voc s mas n o estou disposto a apostar que a possibilidade de mudan a seja de 10

8816468 tennis has been my life since i was eight it is what i know and with all the injuries it was being taken away from me you have your ups and downs in life but i just had all downs really
8816469 i was in tears i was playing badly and i was so close to quitting
8816470 you start to question whether everything youre doing to get back is worth it
8816471 being out for so long i thought maybe id lost my talent on the court
8816472 ive got a few events on the australian pro circuit coming up in queensland and then its all going to lead into the aussie open wildcard playoffs
8816473 theres no reason why i cant get into that im not stopping now

8816483 n s somos um pa s melhor do que este
8816484 the clare has diversity in its terrain from altitude and climate to hills and ridges
8816485 also my wife and i made a pact when we started out that we would only make wine that we like to drink so for example we dont make a chardonnay because the clare cant offer the style we like its not rocket science
8816486 hes one of those guys thats got all the natural talent in the world
8816487 i used to hang out a bit with davo when he was on the tour and its great to see him doing so well again its good to see him focusing on what he does best
8816488 if he puts his mind to it im sure he can be a top 10 contender
8816489 all the attention i got from winning the world title was definitely a distraction at the start of the year
8816490 but hopefully in this next leg i can start to peg them back ive just got to start winning some events and ill get back into it
8816491 while i agree with the reformed position that we cannot save ourselves with good works i believe that some protestants use that
8816492 it closes at two oclock and that aint right its supposed to be a public bathroom it should be open
8816493 we wish we could always go to the bathroom when we get down here
8816494 its a great convenience for people to have public bathrooms but unfortunately its also become a blatant target for vandalism and for abuse
8816495 pulling receptacles off the wall to alcohol and drug abuse
8816496 they come in just to go to the restroom and then they leave
8816497 they dont bother anybody at all i mean they have to use the restroom somewhere too
8816498 i consider fear and loathing in las vegas to be comfort reading i like the al pastor tacos at tacos mexico and i count among my literary influences the chainsaw from doom
8816499 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8816500 myself and some of my closest friends in the agency were essentially thrown out onto the streets in fact name deleted name deleted and myself were literally forced to spend the night on hollywood boulevard with no blankets
8816501 he did tell me that there was gossip around the city gym that rene and gordon were faggots
8816502 people of every creed and colour from every walk of life
8816503 is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8816504 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8816505 why else would he define middle class as someone making under five million dollars a year
8816506 how else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million americans
8816507 how else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax peoples benefits or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college or a plan that would privatise social security and gamble your retirement
8816508 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have obama said
8816509 for while senator mccain was turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 i stood up and opposed this war knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face
8816510 the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9 11 mccain had sought only to
8816511 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8816512 thats not the judgment we need that wont keep america safe we need a president who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past
8816513 you dont defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying iraq he said
8816514 i get it i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
8816515 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8816516 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8816517 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8816518 have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8816519 theres no change at this stage but that depends on journalists and if they put picket lines in place mr walsh said
8816520 we would expect our people not to cross a picket line
8816521 we have a number of staff who are contractually exempt from industrial action mr kirk said
8816522 the plan is to continue to put out the newspapers absolutely as normal and we are well advanced in doing that
8816523 we see no concern in getting the papers out tonight saturday and sunday and monday and beyond if necessary
8816524 i can confirm that mike carltons agreement as a contributor to saturdays
8816525 its my understanding that mike was unprepared to write during the strike 2ues general manager simon rufus said
8816526 this is an indication again that the new regime at fairfax media is embarking on a low quality approach to journalism a spokesman for the media entertainment and arts alliance said
8816527 the management is prepared to trample on anyone who gets in their way
8816528 brutal staff redundancy plans saying further bureau mergers and cuts were being considered
8816529 we have got a problem now with the company it is being run by people who dont have ink in their veins mr noonan told abc radio today
8816530 and this latest act is basically bowing to the market and saying weve got a market downturn here and what do we do we reach for the knife
8816531 this is really a pretty brutal way of doing it
8816532 in discussion that weve had in the last couple of days theyve said not only the canberra bureaus of the two great newspapers are on the table but also so too are foreign bureaus at risk of closure he said
8816533 we always wished to have it at least we thought since the beginning of the year but never got the possibility to do it our very own plastic city radio show so we recorded an imagined radio show hosted by kriss dior and who could be better for this job as the man with the right radio show experience kriss dior aka bassface sascha
8816534 the way of a sluggard is like a hedge of thorns but the path of the upright is a level highway
8816535 whoever is slack in his work is a brother to him who destroys
8816536 if the axe is dull and its edge unsharpened more strength is needed but the distinctions between wisdom and knowledge and skill are straightforward
8816537 esses sapatos s o incr veis s o comfort veis
8816538 you didnt put all of that weight on in one month so you cant expect it to come off in one month
8816539 blokes are sick of being told what they can and cant eat theyve had a gutful of it and are going back to living by their own rules if they feel like having a pie and a few beers theyll have a pie and a few beers
8816540 in my view to withdraw in this manner showed disrespect to this court more critically it showed gross disrespect to mr knights family such insensitive conduct does not in my opinion have any place in this jurisdiction
8816541 mr chandler said dr neal had failed to explain what had changed since the mine claimed on july 22 that it could not assist the inquest any further than its opening submission
8816542 the city of san francisco is being stalked by a huge shaved vampyre cat named chet and only i abby normal emergency back up mistress of the greater bay area night and my manga haired love monkey foo dog stand between the ravenous monster and a bloody massacre of the general public which isnt like as bad as it sounds because the general public kind of sucks ass
8816543 todos acreditamos que impens vel que o amor de nossa vida possa ser uma coisa leve uma coisa que n o pese nada achamos que o amor o que deveria ser que sem ele nossa vida n o seria nossa vida mas muito pelo contr rio ser que um acontecimento n o se torna mais importante e carregado de significa o se depende de um n mero maior de acasos s o acaso pode nos parecer uma mensagem aquilo que acontece por necessidade aquilo que esperado e se repete cotidianamente coisa muda apenas somente o acaso tem voz para que um amor seja inesquec vel preciso que o acaso se encontre nele desde o primeiro instante n o se pode portanto criticar o romance por seu fasc nio pelos encontros misteriosos do acaso mas se pode com raz o criticar o homem por ser cego a esses acasos privando assim a vida da sua dimens o de beleza
8816544 i think she said nationwide i dont think she mentioned state i want everyone to know that was her thing
8816545 i do believe that if you love someone you should be able to get married but its got nothing to do with my life or her life i love her what more do you want we are happy leave us alone
8816546 i doubt anyone would argue now that the 2000 election didnt matter
8816547 mccain is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies those policies all over again
8816548 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president
8816549 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8816550 with john mccains support president bush and vice president cheney have led our nation into one calamity after another because of their indifference to fact their readiness to sacrifice the long term to the short term subordinate the general good to the benefit of the few and short circuit the rule of law
8816551 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you believe its time for a change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8816552 the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8816553 abandoning his support of mandatory caps on global warming pollution
8816554 a change from the approach of bush cheney and mccain
8816555 abandon ing the search for the terrorists who attacked us
8816556 because it would bring in his words shame disgrace and ruin to our nation
8816557 before he entered the white house abraham lincolns experience in elective office consisted of eight years in his state legislature in springfield illinois and one term in congress
8816558 was known chiefly as a clear thinker and a great orator with a passion for justice and a determination to heal the deep divisions of our land
8816559 in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
8816560 liam and me are backstage and he says right so the reason i said that stuff about you was because i saw that programme of you doing an impression of me
8816561 and as he was saying this he was dunking his biscuit in his tea and it was then he started swearing but he left it in too long and it ruined the biscuit
8816562 so it was my fault and i ruined his biscuit then he started being horrible about our band
8816563 wait so if its running doesnt that mean they have the technology that it needs
8816564 i dont want to keep whacking them out for a living ive got a baby girl now so i want to be a good mum and dont want to keep doing modelling for a living being a flight attendant was always something that id thought about doing because its my kind of job i need to be out and about and doing something different every day as long as every day isnt like today i think id enjoy it
8816565 i havent been able to take it home but the first day i got it i got lisa scott lee to take a picture of me and i sent it to him he really liked it
8816566 i would say maffia i get on with her so well we have a good laugh together she is absolutely mental i really love johnny and lisa they are the nicest couple they are my tip to win it could be them two against each other in the final shes just like a little ray of sunshine and hes the cheeky lad that everyone loves
8816567 a little bit i would say kenzie is the naughty boy in the corner that never says anything and just lets out cheeky jokes every now and again who are the swots i would say dan oconnor and johnny theyre the 100 boys whove done well in all the exams mica paris is just the clown who always says i cant do it then ends up doing really well shes a diva but in a good way id say dan is the good looking boy in the gang definitely i think hell do well because girls will love him hes a good looking boy and hes dead polite as well
8816568 id probably say a rock band like whitesnake or someone old school so i could just keep giving them drinks to be fair that wouldnt be a good idea id probably end up getting drunk with them
8816569 if anyone was really rude to me i dont know what id do id just be like you cheeky b h no i wouldnt id keep it a bit more under control thats one thing i think i will struggle with
8816570 as cabin crew i cant really say what i normally would i normally say if your d ks as big as your mouth you better come and see me later but im not allowed to swear in uniform i might say penis instead
8816571 no i dont know how anyone could do it in those stinky little toilets there is no room in there whatsoever if i had the whole plane to myself and you could use the seats then fair enough but not the little loo
8816572 turn your head to the left no your other left now to the right look sexy you look angry try to look sexy smile be crazy be calm be powerful
8816573 i graduated from college in may and this summer seemed like a good time to go through the box of papers and assignments i had been saving since the start both to reminisce and to do a little cleanup
8816574 i dont know why im watching all these white people dancing
8816575 well i guess you guys are the lesser of two evils
8816576 you never realizing how amazing it is until you loose it
8816577 you never realizing how amazing it is until you loose it
8816578 im thinking balls are to men what purses are to women its just a little bag but we feel naked in public without it
8816579 we need sufficient gas to ensure electricity supply reliability the commitment to free up and dedicate new supplies from the south china sea to hong kong to replace the dwindling reserves of the yacheng gasfield is a positive development that will partly fill the gas shortage being faced by us however imports of lng will still be needed to meet our full requirements as our need for clean natural gas continues to grow
8816580 we will need to review with the hong kong government the implications of the memorandum of understanding for the existing proposal to bring lng to hong kong and will study any new options recognising the hong kong lng terminal project is already at an advanced stage of development and is ready to proceed within the current timeframe
8816581 the sustained supply of clean energy from the mainland will greatly reduce the need for hong kong to build a lng terminal within its territory
8816582 los ni os de 10 a os que asistieron a preescolar tienden a obtener mejores calificaciones en las pruebas de matem ticas que los que no recibieron esta educaci n

8816584 se oferta una amplia variedad de becas tanto de ayudas al estudio que se deciden seg n los umbrales de renta y se dirigen a material desplazamiento y libros como para idiomas e intercambios en el extranjero

8816586 sin lugar a dudas la situaci n econ mica tambi n est afectando a los hoteles de lujo aunque con menos fuerza que en otros sectores
8816587 desde el final de la temporada de invierno que fue extraordinaria se est notando una bajada en el nivel de reservas sobre todo como consecuencia de la ca da del mercado nacional y del brit nico
8816588 es el m s d bil y las pernoctaciones se reducen respecto a pocas anteriores el mercado brit nico se mantiene y hemos sufrido mucho el descenso de turistas de eeuu
8816589 es un hecho que hay crisis pero no nos est afectando tanto el n mero de turistas brit nicos y norteamericanos ha descendido pero lo hemos compensado con otros mercados emergentes como asia latinoam rica o los pa ses del este
8816590 a n no lo hemos notado mucho porque la mayor a de nuestros clientes son grupos y miembros de convenciones que reservan con mucha antelaci n
8816591 a n as creceremos en relaci n a 2007 aunque con un ndice menor que el previsto a principios de a o
8816592 las reservas a nivel mundial se han incrementado un 3 pero hay pa ses que est n por debajo de esa cifra como espa a mientras que los alemanes ya suponen un 20 de nuestros clientes

8816664 representing the united states is the ultimate honor and to represent it in the olympic games and to win a gold medal and to raise the flag for your country and then as well do it for the army there is no greater honor
8816665 im very proud to be able to represent the army and my country which is why im dedicating my gold medal to my fellow soldiers this is my mission and ive succeeded
8816666 ive dreamt of going to the olympics ever since i was 12 but i never really thought i would do it the army has given me the confidence i needed to make it go from a dream to reality
8816667 i started shooting when i was eight and ive had a lot of success over the years but i came in 12th in sydney and 17th in athens since i joined the army in 2006 ive had nothing but the best training facilities and the absolute best teammates to push and support me
8816668 it makes such a huge difference and i truly believe theyve helped me fulfill a dream i dont think this wouldve ever happened without them
8816669 the army asked these young men to go and represent their military and the united states and they certainly made us proud
8816670 they didnt act like theyve never won before or they never expect to be there again they were professional
8816671 although when we spoke seven hours later each still had the grin on their face that was present at the medal ceremony
8816672 it was a tremendous honor to be the first shooter entering the u s olympic hall of fame

8816682 i must say i did not admire the nicaraguan sandinistas much
8816683 but there was never anything of that nature it just didnt happen
8816684 honestly if my boss had grabbed a foreign government official like that and lifted him up i would certainly remember that
8816685 mccain was down at the end of the table and we were talking to the head of the guerrilla group here at this end of the table and i dont know what attracted my attention
8816686 but i saw some kind of quick movement at the bottom of the table and i looked down there and john had reached over and grabbed this guy by the shirt collar and had snatched him up like he was throwing him up out of the chair to tell him what he thought about him or whatever
8816687 i dont know what he mccain was telling him but i thought good grief everybody around here has got guns and we were there on a diplomatic mission i dont know what had happened to provoke john but he obviously got mad at the guy and he just reached over there and snatched him
8816688 sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
8816689 one end to which obando reportedly put the money was religious instruction to thwart the marxist leninist policies of the sandinistas
8816690 rosa had her breasts cut off then they the contras cut into her chest and took out her heart the men had their arms broken their testicles cut off and their eyes poked out they were killed by slitting their throats and pulling the tongue out through the slit
8816691 a killer amendment if attached to the contra aid plan
8816692 this amendment is death by hemorrhage it lets the contras bleed to death over the next six months
8816693 there is no way of knowing whether this money was comingled with funds from other sources meaning that our aid money could have been used to buy guns and ammunition instead of medicine and clothing
8816694 we are carrying out an operation in which the countries that are cooperating with us have asked us to be as quiet as possible
8816695 the government of honduras wants as little publicity as possible it seems to me that we would want to protect them from being identified as a conduit of supplies for the contras even if this is a well known fact
8816696 has got to show more clearly that military overthrow is not their sole goal and that we would support whatever diplomatic activities would achieve the same goal
8816697 beef up the economic and military capabilities of nicaraguas neighbors
8816698 i am skeptical about some provisions some omissions in the plan right now a peace process is going forward and were not really players in it we just cant abandon the contras american credibility cant stand one more trip down that disastrous road they the contras have to play a role in negotiations they have to be a party to both cease fire arrangements and post ceasefire political activities inside nicaragua the only reason the sandinistas have negotiated at all is that weve kept the heat on through aid to the contras we cant give up all our leverage just as the crucial talks start
8816699 this constitutes irrefutable proof that it is the united states which really wants to boycott the peace process in central america
8816700 these terrorist acts are being brought on by the belligerent tone of president reagan and his spokesmen who have expressed their desire to destroy the revolution and frustrate peace efforts
8816701 military aid would stop but the president would have the authority to resume it unless congress objected or if the sandinistas try to take military advantage of the period of negotiations or cease fire
8816702 we want a democratic environment to exist in nicaragua but to achieve that objective it is indispensable that the united states pressure the sandinistas
8816703 does anyone have faith in ortega or the communist sandinistas
8816704 mccains moment came when dole had finished his talking points and ortega responded
8816705 the sandinista ortega said senator in our country we have a saying that claims that when one has to negotiate one sits with the owner of the circus and not with the clowns
8816706 it was a verbal blow not a physical one and from my standpoint it was a rhetorical home run there was no physical contact between mccain and any of the sandinistas present
8816707 the experience vision and values needed to strengthen our country for future generations
8816708 though sen mccain has had problems with his temper he has overcome them though sen cochran saw the incident he described to you decades have passed since then and he wanted to make the point that over the years he has seen sen mccain mature into an individual who is not only spirited and tenacious but also thoughtful and levelheaded

8816850 im emotionally kind of a middle of the road guy i know what to expect
8816851 anybody running is going to say something they wish theyd have kept
8816852 what went through my mind the work has just begun its not partying time partying time will be after he wins the presidency officially we have begun the race
8816853 i may be somewhat emotional myself because it is history and anytime you make history well i may get teary eyed i knew the time would come but i never thought i would see it in my lifetime
8816854 to witness it upfront it will bring tears to your eye its a monumental thing im not subject to break down all the way but im subject to break down
8816855 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring
8816856 we need a president who puts barney smith before smith barney
8816857 let me spell out exactly what that change will mean if i am president
8816858 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8816859 these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8816860 a misleading speech that was fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8816861 people had wanted him to be strong and lay out the argument for whats going on for the american people
8816862 thats what hes doing theres no wimpy guy up there
8816863 we claim the victory for barack as the first african american president of the united states
8816864 this is something i never thought i would live to see
8816865 in my lifetime i never thought i would see a black president and im only 29
8816866 although the department asserts it briefed all commission members individually no briefing documents specific dates or calendars were provided to auditors to verify these briefings
8816867 i am committed to increasing the departments transparency and the recommendations identified in this audit put us another step closer to realizing that goal
8816868 the people of texas deserve a world class transportation system
8816869 im hopeful this report along with recommendations made by the sunset commission will provide the legislature with a good road map for making immediate and long term improvements to our transportation system
8816870 however i must admit i am dismayed to learn that there were persons in the department who became aware of this error as early as september 2007 and yet it was not brought to the legislatures attention until early this year
8816871 he helped me remember what america used to be like because the last eight years have been demoralizing
8816872 are they feasible can he fix health care and the economy cut our dependence on foreign oil and cut taxes
8816873 hes a really good speaker hes motivational he gives that great locker room speech
8816874 hes really ingratiating himself to me who is typically republican
8816875 forty seven million people who cant go to the doctor as i can bothers me
8816876 i dont think in an acceptance speech he can go too much into it
8816877 hes trying to reach out to the anti bush republicans
8816878 i urge texans along the coast to monitor this storm closely heed warnings from their local leaders and take necessary precautions to protect their families homes and businesses
8816879 treat others the way we would like to be treated
8816880 for 10 years my parents have been national night out block captains and they sat outside for two hours that thursday night
8816881 on friday he wasnt feeling good and he went to the doctor who sent him to another doctor when he suspected west nile from the symptoms on saturday he was feeling worse and that night he went to the emergency room
8816882 by sunday he was on a ventilator so its been a little bit over a year since hes been home
8816883 this year has been a fairly light year compared to the previous several years
8816884 most of the time when theres a pretty intense disease transmission season it normally occurs in drier weather and not when we get a lot of rain
8816885 its a devastating disease and it virtually destroyed every muscle in his body
8816886 i never thought id see him in a wheelchair weve been to four hospitals and every one of them has done a great job
8816887 i have to do this i have to go home
8816888 i have learned from my mistakes im not going to see it live again
8816889 you hear nothing but wind water houses falling and people hollering
8816890 we are not at the point where we can bury katrina
8816891 theyve already packed their bags but theyre cautiously optimistic theyre hoping for the best
8816892 i used to come out here on saturday morning and wash my truck and watch the kids playing
8816893 from this street to the next to the next to the next to the next five blocks deep everything was gone
8816894 let us give our nation a leader who has heard this clarion call and will help us achieve the change we need
8816895 i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8816896 i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans
8816897 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8816898 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8816899 to end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaida and the taliban in afghanistan
8816900 not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8816901 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8816902 have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8816903 we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future let us keep that promise that american promise and in the words of scripture hold firmly without wavering to the hope that we confess
8816904 i want to go out and compete and at the end of the year everything works itself out
8816905 im throwing the ball well but theres been a lot of games this year i thought i threw the ball well and came up empty obviously the last two games ive thrown the ball pretty good and kept them off balance
8816906 these last two starts have really been terrific and im hoping thats the real brandon backe we see
8816907 he did the same thing here last time out and attacked the zone with his fastball and went to his off speed stuff when he needed to he was really good
8816908 im looking at eight innings or a complete game going into the seventh inning
8816909 im not trying to get ahead of myself but its certainly possible to get two outs and have all the stuff happen a ball that goes halfway to third and i would have had to have made a great play it starts from there
8816910 they had a triple that gets in the nook of the crawford boxes and i walk a guy adam rosales who hasnt established himself in the league and here you go im more frustrated i didnt last longer than 62 3
8816911 if there is a difference its early on in the season i felt good and i busted up my thumb and it took a little bit to get my timing going since the middle to end of may thats when i started feeling comfortable at the plate
8816912 for the modern electrical engineer the lure of the laplace transform is its ability to map the complicated
8816913 so if they danced whilst wearing cotton i cant wear cotton either
8816914 clearly conscious of the charge that he is in empty suit devoid of specifics in short he defined change instead of just calling for it
8816915 i get it and we can all do better than this
8816916 stanley kurtzs appearance on the milt rosenberg radio program in chicago last night provided an unsettling look into the authoritarian tactics being employed by the obama campaign to stifle and intimidate its critics
8816917 we are receiving many emails asking what happens if in fact senator obama is forced to step down or is removed as the democratic nominee for this reason we have posted the democratic national comittees 2008 call rules and
8816918 if you cannot multitask or communicate without being passive aggressive dont even bother replying
8816919 i can be a tad difficult to work for im loud pushy and while i used to think we paid well i am no longer sure
8816920 i made a commitment to stay in the job for at least a year
8816921 i met the oldest child but not the others which my mother said was crazy to accept the job without meeting all the kids so well see
8816922 if you are fundamentally unhappy with your life you will be more unhappy if you take this job so do us all a favor and get some treatment or move to the rockies but do not apply for employment with us
8816923 also if you suspect all wealthy women are frivolous we are not for you
8816924 i have all sorts of theories on how to stack my dishwasher and if you are judgmental about ritalin for adhd or think such things are caused by too much sugar again deal break city
8816925 i hope she likes it here i sent the ad to one of my old sitters and she said she felt it was pretty accurate which sort of stung a little bit
8816926 there will be no announcement tonight there will be no leak tonight this is barack obamas night his nomination is a singular achievement tonights his night to make his case
8816927 this is truly a good day for america tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator a job well done
8816928 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8816929 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8816930 i have gone back and forth on this because as a player youll always want to play youll never lose that urge to be out there but i could only do this if i could commit 100 percent physically mentally emotionally and i cant do that ive tried to convince myself and my body to give it one more year but in the end i just dont think i could turn it on like i need to again
8816931 bordeaux and burgundy fraternal enemies are two faces of a stimulating dialectic and debate that one must hope will not soon cease

8816935 never give up never give up never give up that ship
8816936 surely you judge dont really think thats what the legislature meant
8816937 when your grandparents were here you acted so terrible when we went to dinner there were four adults and no one could control you now it is just me and the two of you and you are little angels
8816938 leave it up to the rest of the country to decide

8816940 reach into a decaying corpse torso amp pull out a few vital organs with my bare hands
8816941 leave it up to the rest of the country to decide
8816942 today was the 1st day back to classes at duquesne university and all young dems that i talked to were happy about this
8816943 were really reaching out to democrats theres no question that in particular the woman supporters of hillary clinton are very dissatisfied with the choice john mccain wants to be a president for all americans he is very appealing to folks that want a potus president of the united states that will reach across the aisle with convictions judgment and experience
8816944 little kids were eating organic potatoes saying i love this
8816945 our local farm is more than just a supplier of potatoes
8816946 we want kids to know where their food comes from how it is grown and what it means to our environment when you have beautiful farmland and rolling hills instead of a housing development
8816947 its much easier to open a box of frozen french fries and throw them on a tray
8816948 he knows to grow enough and store them for me so i have them from november to march

8816983 especially urgent to offer young people a course of scholastic formation which is not reduced to a simple individualistic and instrumental fruition of service with a view to obtaining a qualification as well as gaining knowledge students must also have a strong experience of sharing with their educators
8816984 three fundamental aspects of cooperation between lay faithful and consecrated persons in the catholic school 1 communion in the educational mission 2 necessary course of formation for communion and 3 openness towards others as the fruit of that communion
8816985 i took great pride in being a student athlete at the university of virginia i could not see myself transferring to another school or playing for another college basketball team therefore i have decided to forego my last year of ncaa eligibility and pursue my dream of playing basketball at the professional level
8816986 i want to thank the university of virginia for everything it has done for me over the past three years
8816987 i especially want to thank the fans my teammates and all who have supported me during my time here i hope that they felt the emotion that i played with and saw that i gave it my all every time i wore the virginia jersey

8816992 i dont know about you but im not willing to take a 10 chance of change

8816994 ours is a promise that says government cant solve all our problems
8816995 drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8816996 while senator mccain was turning his sights on iraq just days after 9 11
8816997 my call for a time frame to remove troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration
8816998 ive got news for john mccain we all put our country first
8816999 we may not all agree on abortion but we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies
8817000 surely we can agree that our gay brothers and sisters
8817001 in times like these change doesnt come from washington it comes from washington
8817002 i am howard dean the chairman of the democratic party and i know how many houses i own
8817003 john mccain is not a maverick john mccain is a yes man
8817004 the tip is if theres too many white people eating in a place theres something wrong
8817005 for me though the highlight of the show was the arrays of hand drawn cartoons mostly done by henson himself around the walls of the exhibit the cartoons showed his thought processes how he built characters and then built stories around them
8817006 soon to be transferred to the new academy building too are legions of bats flying geckos chameleons ants by the thousands and many more animals and plants

8817014 well i saw the film and it was and was not what i was expecting
8817015 there is an unmistakable degree of recovery in july which is surprising given that it is generally regarded as the worst winter month with good improvement in median prices around the country despite continued low sales volumes auckland was the notable exception with a further fall in the median price from 435 000 in june to 421 000 on dismal sales of 1 411 properties
8817016 i thought it was good last year when they threw in a mid major like southern illinois the saluki fans looked like the only student body that entirely filled the stands that early in the day
8817017 chancellor professor was set to be reinstated before he died
8817018 we do follow due process he ulysses s grant association president frank williams went after us on due process he was wrong we do follow due process the issue was near resolution when unfortunately dr john y simon passed away july 8
8817019 what he williams who is also chief justice of the rhode island supreme court did was he picked up various stages of the investigation process it had not been completed hes a judge he should know that during a trial what happened halfway through may or may not be how its going to end he picked up stuff that happened halfway through he did not ask im sure he knew where i was going on the review but he ignored it
8817020 what is important is how it was going to end not what was going on during the discussions and he never even mentioned that it was not going the way he portrayed it
8817021 we have to make sure all of the people who work on campus are not subject to a hostile environment thats my job where there is a hostile environment i have to see to it that that doesnt go on anymore but i cant describe specifics about it to anybody
8817022 if he williams knew anything specific i dont know where he got it he didnt get it from me
8817023 we plead guilty its taking too long theres no doubt its taking too long weve got to get out with it
8817024 im really banging tables desks saying where is this stuff i did that with the student conduct code it was taking way too long
8817025 my hope is well get it to them in a hurry there are some very difficult issues to deal with when dealing with issues of sexual harassment its very very difficult this is not an excuse but in part its generational things that in my generation were said and nobody paid attention to or nobody voiced an opinion it doesnt happen anymore
8817026 there was a time when we could look at a woman and say hi honey sweetie we cant do that now and we shouldnt do that now we havent quite cleared the generations theres a generation that hangs on and says whats wrong with that and theres a generation that says theres a lot wrong with it so to find language that crosses over from one generation to the next is tough
8817027 it was wrong then and its wrong now the difference is were getting a reaction now which we never got before
8817028 i say to them that the proof is in the process that we develop the process is handled by others to look at and we would put all of this in whatever groups that review it these are not closed door sessions that is i dont look at a case like professor x and say i think this happened off with him its no longer off with his head nobody has that kind of power it goes through a process its called due process which we do have
8817029 what is the alternative to being secretive on a due process case on sexual harassment lets discuss it in the marketplace we have a persons life here

8817189 i wonder what would happen if we all agreed to read one of the gospels until we came to a place that told us to do something then went out to do it and only after we had done it began reading again there are aspects of the gospel that are puzzling and difficult to understand but our problems are not centered around the things we dont understand but rather the things we do understand the things we could not possibly misunderstand our problem is not so much that we dont know what we should do we know perfectly well but we dont want to do it

8817196 if barack hussein obama is elected president there is no chance that the u s air force will be ordered to destroy muslim terrorist irans nuclear bomb making program and obama will also pressure tiny israel not to destroy the iranian nuclear terrorist facilities since a decisive military strike from the air is the only realistic hope of stopping iran from completing its nuclear terrorist program this means that an obama presidency will lead directly to a nuclear armed terrorist iran
8817197 if muslim terrorist iran gets its hands on nuclear bombs then every other muslim nation in the middle east will develop or acquire nuclear weapons as well saudi arabia egypt syria and other muslim nations will get nuclear bombs leading to a massive nuclear arms race in the muslim world since all of these islamic countries sponsor a myriad of muslim terrorist organizations there is no doubt that muslim terrorists will also get their hands on nuclear weapons this will lead to a muslim terrorist nuclear holocaust against the united states and or israel
8817198 therefore if we do not destroy muslim terrorist irans nuclear bomb making program before it is too late we are literally committing national suicide and if barack hussein obama is elected that is exactly what will occur

8817272 town aint burning no more look like the snow put it out
8817273 ill be out in a minute to help you get the fires started
8817274 we lost twelve men the other day eight more wounded
8817275 most are still out there in the snow still on the road
8817276 his voice trailed off as he flashed a pained expression
8817277 i want you to stay here and rest then maybe you can help mr chung with breakfast
8817278 are you going to try to make it into town today
8817279 unless we need some provisions i see no point in trying now

8817281 you did a fine job fixing up those wounded men henri
8817282 fixing up the men henri they were all very grateful for your attention to their wounds
8817283 i was just glad we had enough dressings for them that man barstow who lost some of his fingers i thought id never get that to stop bleeding
8817284 id say you have a talent for it henri maybe you should think about medical school
8817285 and miss dinners with your mother youre breaking my heart
8817286 he glanced back at the men who gazed in curiosity at the deer meat sizzling over the fires
8817287 town burned winter messing up work who knows didnt like the man anyways
8817288 i kept a straight face which wasnt hard considering my cheeks were half frozen
8817289 you wont be paid until the middle of next month youll have to provide your own weapons and ammunition for now at least until the roads clear to bring in supplies
8817290 but if you have your own then youre free to use it and set it up in the same manner as the others
8817291 depending upon when mr creamer starts construction again youll be working around camp and keeping watch in the area for these fiends who attacked us and burned the town we may going in to help rebuild ironton as soon as i have word from the governor
8817292 camp is up at sunrise we eat breakfast then muster at seven sharp no card playing no prostitutes women or strangers in the camp and if you see someone trying to get into camp you alert myself or corporal buehler
8817293 you will follow my orders and the corporals to the letter saturdays after your chores are done you will be free to do as you wish and sundays being the lords day we rest in camp if you need a horse see corporal buehler
8817294 henris eyes blanched as if i had just goosed him
8817295 mr laurent would you get me the companys bible please
8817296 do you solemnly swear in the presence of this holy book and the members of this company to honor and defend this country and your home state to the best of your abilities and to serve the governor of the state of missouri with fidelity strength of purpose and unfailing courage
8817297 you are now sworn in as soldiers in the militia of the state of missouri welcome gentlemen
8817298 those that i have just sworn into service need to see mr laurent and give him your names for the muster rolls and to keep track of who is to be paid i recognize the rest of you so we will forego calling roll today but we will resume this practice once we have a full list
8817299 a terrible and heinous crime has befallen our land and as soldiers in service to this state your outrage should match the evil these renegades have brought down upon us
8817300 i urge you to pray for your dead comrades and for those murdered by these fiends in the past few days we will be burying these dead in the coming week so i hope your stomachs are as strong as your hearts
8817301 the cold will make it difficult to guard the camp at night but this must be done and those who volunteer for this duty will confer with corporal buehler and myself before nightfall
8817302 i need three men for tonights duty to be carried out in five hour shifts you will receive double rations for each meal tomorrow
8817303 good you three meet here at my tent after dinner
8817304 i also need volunteers to go for firewood before dark you will receive extra rations for breakfast in the morning
8817305 make sure you keep track of who gets the extra rations mr laurent
8817306 stay alert gentlemen and sleep with your weapons by your side you are dismissed
8817307 make sure they share that meat among everyone and have mr chung boil some potatoes to go along with it
8817308 nothing much lieutenant post office still closed some workers and local folks wandering the streets town looks dead sir

8817338 with climate change and globalisation the ageing of the population is one of the major challenges europe must face
8817339 from 2015 onwards deaths would outnumber births and population growth due to natural increase would cease
8817340 positive net migration would be the only population growth factor however from 2035 this positive net migration would no longer counterbalance the negative natural change
8817341 i am concerned that there are people who are still attempting to find strategems to avoid compliance with federal law
8817342 city officials have been directed by the mayor to refer all undocumented felons to immigration regardless of age
8817343 that process is in line with the procedures established by the previous government on the consideration of visa applicants
8817344 mr broadus has not been granted a visa there are further steps required beyond character assessment before a visa is granted
8817345 the department has now decided to do a full assessment of the character of mr broadus
8817346 community complaints have no effect on the grant or otherwise of a visa each application is assessed individually on its merits
8817347 as a result of public concern and interest the department has decided that in fact we will be undertaking a more thorough assessment of mr broadus character
8817348 however the decision on the granting or refusal of a visa application is made on the individual merit of the case consistent with the legal criteria for the class of the visa

8817384 oh no renesmee might grow up to like age 90 in a few months and then die
8817385 advice id give to a recent graduate would be to go back and get a masters degree
8817386 if thats not an option then i recommend diversifying in the professional world youre initially judged by your education and school pedigree
8817387 its hard enough to get your r sum looked at without a masters degree
8817388 its marginal the amount of real world preparation i took from school itself
8817389 what i took from my undergrad years was how to manage my time responsibly and multitask which has lend itself to being successful at any job
8817390 current students should realize that there is no right or wrong pedigree needed to pursue a career path of your liking
8817391 you just need to be 100 percent committed to it and if you fail all you can do is re evaluate your approach or allow yourself to matriculate in other areas related to said career
8817392 you cant just look for that first job to be the grandiose end all be all job
8817393 unlike some of our parents generation your first job is not likely to serve you until retirement you need to view each job especially your first as building blocks to something greater youll eventually get to where you want to be but you need to not be afraid to try a platform of positions and experiences in the process because in the long run this will make you a more versatile and credible candidate for any job
8817394 even if you are waiting tables having a long term job on your resume shows responsibility that will make you a more desirable candidate intern somewhere do at least two internships three if you are unsure exactly what aspect of your field you are interested in interning allows you to get hands on experience and perhaps more importantly gives you great contacts in the industry that will come in handy later on
8817395 once you get hired in likely at an entry level be willing to go the extra mile
8817396 in this crappy economy employers are looking for more bang for their buck this doesnt mean you have to work extra super hard for no money but it does mean that you need to prove yourself a standout if you want to grow in that company if you make yourself indispensable youll be climbing the ladder in no time
8817397 ive met a lot of bartenders that have a communication degree
8817398 marriage rests in the family and not the family in marriage
8817399 the major change in the family in recent year and the problems of future are both summed up in one word women
8817400 the trouble comes from the fact that the institution we call marriage cant hold two full human beings it was only designed for one and half
8817401 perfect marriage can only be one and a half human beings not two

8817417 khilafah atau imamah uzhma atau imaratul mukminin semuanya memberikan makna yang satu sama dan menunjukkan tugas yang satu sama yaitu kekuasaan tertinggi bagi kaum muslimin
8817418 telah kami jelaskan hakikat kedudukan ini khalifah dan bahwa ia adalah pengganti dari pemilik syariah rasulullah saw dalam menjaga agama dan mengatur dunia dengan agama kedudukan ini dinamakan khilafah dan imamah dan orang yang melaksanakannya dinamakan khalifah dan imam
8817419 khilafah atau imamah atau imaratul mukminin atau yang berarti sistem berdasarkan musyawarah yang menghimpun kemaslahatan dunia dan akhirat semuanya mempunyai pengertian yang sama
8817420 patut diperhatikan bahwa khilafah imamah kubra dan imaratul mukminin adalah istilah istilah yang sinonim dengan makna yang sama
8817421 boleh saja imam itu disebut dengan khalifah imam atau amirul mukminin
8817422 barangsiapa membaiat seorang imam lalu ia memberikan genggaman tangannya dan buah hatinya kepadanya hendaklah ia mentaati imam itu sekuat kemampuannya kemudian jika datang orang lain yang hendak merebut kekuasaan imam itu maka penggallah leher orang lain itu

8817427 sebelum membaca buku ini saya sudah banyak menulis makalah baik di seminar atau surat kabar bahwa utang luar negeri dipakai negara negara pemberi utang untuk menjalankan politik imperialisme kepada negara lain
8817428 tak ada ceritanya utang luar negeri untuk membantu pembangunan negara hal ini tak lain merupakan proses pembohongan publik
8817429 dulu belanda mau berdagang rempah rempah tapi ia mencoba menguras indonesia dengan mengambil keuntungan dari bisnis rempah rempah seperti gula dan perkebunan tapi as sejak tahun 1960 an lebih berorientasi ke sumber daya alam
8817430 karena kerja sama itu dilakukan dengan berbagai cara jadi pejabat pejabat yang terlibat dalam pembuatan utang luar negeri perlu diwaspadai
8817431 ini bukan isapan jempol tapi menjadi pembenaran terhadap teori konspirasi tersebut
8817432 yang terjadi di indonesia baru economic hit man negara negara besar belum perlu menjalankan policy pembunuhan atau invasi militer namun hanya dengan tahap pertama itu mereka sudah bisa mengeliminir peran para pemimpin indonesia untuk tunduk pada kebijakan mereka

8817446 lukewarm people are continually concerned with playing it safe they are slaves to the god of control this focus on safe living keeps them from sacrificing and risking for god

8817491 of course we would never undermine a piece of legislation so important as this because of something that is happening in politics because of untoward circumstances and people in new zealand
8817492 a champion for working americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours
8817493 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach

8817496 the truth is on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives on health care and education and the economy sen mccain has been anything but independent
8817497 why else would he define middle class as someone making under 5 million dollars a year
8817498 because defenders of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8817499 with the nomination of sen barack obama tonight the man who will lead the democratic party in its march toward the white house we are making a down payment on the fulfillment of that dream
8817500 could not help thinking how proud my father would be proud of barack obama proud of the party that nominated him and proud of the america that will elect him
8817501 aiming for a lot of high rhetoric i am much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives
8817502 sen obama this is truly a good day for america

8817637 god bless america in 2008 and we are still talking about censoring artists i bet these right wing zealots have quite a porn collection stashed in their closets while we are at it lets ban dirty dancing lock up the tv and close down the movie theaters lets ban olympic athletes from competing if they protest the chinese government lets cover women with veils from head to toe in garments so they are not provocative i understand a free community production and family entertainment i even have a young daughter of my own but the kottonmouth kings concert had a cover charge to get in we didnt force anyone to be there
8817638 come to think of it church is free maybe we should put censorship stickers on bibles because in the pages seems to be a lot of rhetoric about war violence rape incest and sex so i hope they dont let their children hear that stuff
8817639 its funny how people get upset about a group like the kottonmouth kings who spread a message of peace and good vibrations yet when we were in town there was a bar on every corner and more drunk idiots roaming the streets then i can count goes to show you that alcohol is americas drug of choice

8817651 in all major socializing forces you will find an underlying movement to gain and maintain power through the use of words from which doctor to priest to bureaucrat it is all the same a governed populace must be conditioned to accept power words as actual things to confuse the symbolized system with the tangible universe in the maintenance of such a power structure certain symbols are kept out of common understanding symbols such as those dealing with economic manipulation or those which define the local interpretations of sanity symbol secrecy of this form leads to the development of fragmented sub languages each being a signal that its users are accumulating some form of power with this insight into a power process our imperial security force must be ever alert to the formation of sub languages

8817661 hoy se conocen los motivos anat micos y fisiol gicos que lo generan y
8817662 es un padecimiento que debe estudiarse en distintos planos porque
8817663 estas emociones est n ligadas a un neurotransmisor llamado asociado a la gratificaci n y la saciedad por eso los tratamientos apuntan a recomponer su equilibrio cuando hay un desarreglo desde el punto de vista qu mico el placer depende de dos sustancias la dopamina y las endorfinas cuyos niveles son bajos en las personas que tienen malhumor no puede haber goce cuando no fluyen en determinadas dosis en el cerebro asimismo hay un zona llamada am gdala asociada a las emociones negativas que debe estar en calma para que haya placer desde el punto de vista psicoanal tico un malhumorado es alguien que no responde seg n sus ganas no est en contacto con su deseo y vive en estado de frustraci n adem s vive en un espacio de agresi n constante siempre se siente atacado o agredido por lo cual se encierra y se pone a la defensiva el problema es que as como el humor contacta y socializa el malhumor corta el lazo a sla y quien no tiene humor no puede recibirlo y es una pena el humor permite satirizar situaciones duras es un condimento esencial para vivir mejor yo he vivido como alguien que nunca comi sal

8817666 otros signos son la insatisfacci n y la inseguridad sentimientos que disparan la decepci n el reproche la hostilidad

8817669 el humor como todo lo an mico y lo emocional tiene que ver con estados tan cambiantes que son muy dif ciles de pesquisar y s lo se pueden estudiar con tecnolog as muy precisas como la resonancia magn tica funcional que permite observar qu zonas del cerebro se activan ante cada emoci n de todos modos todo est en etapa experimental se est creando un nuevo mapa de las emociones del cerebro hoy podemos medir las sensaciones registrarlas y de esa manera alejarlas de la mera reacci n superflua nuestras emociones son org nicas tienen un sustrato bioqu mico en el cual la memoria y la experiencia previa juegan un rol preponderante

8817675 china was eager to present something that shows it is a new power that has its own might
8817676 it has problems but it is able to manage them it has weaknesses in its institutions but also strengths in those same institutions
8817677 the world has learned about china and china has learned about the world
8817678 i believe this is something that will have positive effects for the long term
8817679 they have earned a tremendous amount of face because of the olympics
8817680 they are going to ride on that for a while we dont have a culture that is pro change china by nature has got to be provoked to make changes the economic reforms came about because we were desperately poor
8817681 for the chinese authorities to sentence them at all shows the governments insecurity and intolerance of even the most peaceful challenges to its authoritarian control
8817682 i would hope that we would look back at this as a major threshold of when china ditched all its baggage of the historical narrative of aggrieved nationalism
8817683 and just rewrote that narrative and began to act with more confidence about itself and its role in the world
8817684 i think that would make china and chinese become more tolerant and open

8817772 kalaulah seandainya kaum muslimin tahu apa yang ada di dalam ramadhan niscaya umatku akan berangan angan agar satu tahun ramadhan seluruhnya
8817773 wahai manusia sungguh bulan yang agung telah datang menaungi kalian
8817774 barangsiapa yang berbuka puasa satu hari pada bulan ramadhan tanpa ada sebab tidak pula karena sakit maka puasa satu tahun pun tidak akan dapat menggantikannya walaupun ia berpuasa pada satu tahun tersebut
8817775 barangsiapa sholat tarawih dengan dilandasi keimanan dan mengharap pahala dari alloh maka akan diampuni dosa dosanya yang telah lalu
8817776 dari zaid bin khlid al juhani dia berkata saya akan mempraktekkan shalat malam rosululloh beliau shalat dua rakaat ringan lalu shalat dua rakaat sangat lama demikian pula dua rakaat berikutnya dan sesudahnya lalu shalat dua rakaat tetapi lebih pendek dari sebelumnya lalu shalat dua rakaat yang lebih pendek dari sebelumnya kemudian shalat witir maka jumlahnya adalah tiga belas rakaat
8817777 rosululloh biasa tidur malam apabila bangun beliau bersiwak berwudhu kemudian melakukan sholat delapan rakaat salam setiap dua rakaat setelah itu beliau berwitir lima rakaat tasyahhud pada rakaat yang kelima jika muadzin menguman dangkan adzan beliau shalat dua rakaat ringan
8817778 rosululloh tidak pernah sholat di bulan ramadhan maupun di bulan selainnya lebih dari sebelas rakaat
8817779 barangsiapa mau silakan witir dengan lima rakaat atau tiga rakaat atau satu rakaat
8817780 sesungguhnya barangsiapa shalat tarawih bersama imam berjamaah sampai selesai maka ditulis baginya sama dengan shalat semalam suntuk
8817781 arfajah ats tsaqofi menceritakan ali bin abi thalib memerintahkan manusia untuk shalat tarawih dan menjadikan seorang imam bagi laki laki dan imam bagi wanita
8817782 bahwa aisyah mengimami para wanita dan beliau berdiri di tengah tengah shaf mereka di shalat wajib
8817783 apabila imam melakukan qunut maka makmum ikut mengaminkan yang saya ketahui masalah ini tidak diperselisihkan hal ini dikatakan oleh ishak bin rahuyah
8817784 sesungguhnya qunut di shalat witir adalah sunnah tetapi apabila dilakukan secara kontinyu tidak disunnahkan jika dilakukan kadang kadang maka itu baik karena qunut ini diajarkan oleh beliau kepada cucunya yaitu ai hasan bin ali tetapi yang saya ketahui beliau tidak pernah melakukan qunut pada shalat witir
8817785 tidak akan sah sholat seseorang hingga menegakkan meluruskan punggungnya ketika ruku dan sujud
8817786 sesungguhnya pencuri yang paling buruk adalah orang yang mencuri shalatnya
8817787 kemudian aku melihat laki laki buta itu melakukan beberapa gerakan yang gambarannya terus melekat di kepalaku yang akhirnya aku ketahui bahwa itu adalah shalatnya orang orang islam sikap laki laki itu mampu menguasai pikiranku untuk beberapa waktu ia tidak ngotot untuk mengajakku menemaninya menuju rumahnya namun kemudian ia menghormatiku tanpa imbalan apa pun dan tanpa perlu mengenaliku terlebih dahulu padahal ia tidak memahami bahasaku apa yang ia lakukan barusan di hadapanku apa arti gerakan gerakan itu ketika aku melihat ada bayang bayang laki laki itu sedang melakukan gerakan itu hal ini mendorongku untuk mengenali mereka dan prinsip ajaran agama mereka sungguh perjalanan yang panjang hingga akhirnya membuatku masuk islam peristiwa itu adalah benang pertamanya ke arah sana

8817798 an academic attacking some ideological position which s he believes to be mistaken must of course attack that position in its strongest form this dawkins does not do in the case of einstein and his failure is the crucial index of his insincerity of academic purpose and therefore warrants me in charging him with having become what he has probably believed to be an impossibility a secularist bigot

8817805 representing the united states is the ultimate honor and to represent it in the olympic games and to win a gold medal and to raise the flag for your country and then as well do it for the army there is no greater honor
8817806 im very proud to be able to represent the army and my country which is why im dedicating my gold medal to my fellow soldiers this is my mission and ive succeeded
8817807 ive dreamt of going to the olympics ever since i was 12 but i never really thought i would do it the army has given me the confidence i needed to make it go from a dream to reality
8817808 i started shooting when i was eight and ive had a lot of success over the years but i came in 12th in sydney and 17th in athens since i joined the army in 2006 ive had nothing but the best training facilities and the absolute best teammates to push and support me
8817809 it makes such a huge difference and i truly believe theyve helped me fulfill a dream i dont think this wouldve ever happened without them
8817810 the army asked these young men to go and represent their military and the united states and they certainly made us proud
8817811 they didnt act like theyve never won before or they never expect to be there again they were professional
8817812 although when we spoke seven hours later each still had the grin on their face that was present at the medal ceremony
8817813 it was a tremendous honor to be the first shooter entering the u s olympic hall of fame
8817814 i know that spc eller and pfc hancock have the same army training and discipline to help them fulfill their wildest dreams too

8817818 when the lord your god brings you into the land which you go to possess and has cast out many nations before you the hittites and the girgashites and the amorites and the canaanites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites seven nations greater and mightier than you 2 and when the lord your god delivers them over to you you shall conquer them and utterly destroy them
8817819 for you are a holy people to the lord your god the lord your god has chosen you to be a people for himself a special treasure above all the peoples on the face of the earth
8817820 god has every right to choose who he wants to associate with even as you have the right to choose who you want to associate with why should i deny god the rights that i want for myself
8817821 therefore know that the lord your god he is god the faithful god who keeps covenant and mercy for a thousand generations with those who love him and keep his commandments 10 and he repays those who hate him to their face to destroy them
8817822 but thats impossible theres no way i can truly keep his commandments
8817823 then it shall come to pass because you listen to these judgments and keep and do them that the lord your god will keep with you the covenant and the mercy which he swore to your fathers
8817824 if you should say in your heart these nations are greater than i how can i dispossess them
8817825 every commandment which i command you today you must be careful to observe that you may live and multiply and go in and possess the land of which the lord swore to your fathers
8817826 therefore you shall keep the commandments of the lord your god to walk in his ways and to fear him
8817827 i love you in fact i love you enough to give you what you need when you need it
8817828 beware that you do not forget the lord your god by not keeping his commandments his judgments and his statutes which i command you today 12 lest when you have eaten and are full and have built beautiful houses and dwell in them 13 and when your herds and your flocks multiply and your silver and your gold are multiplied and all that you have is multiplied 14 when your heart is lifted up and you forget the lord your god who brought you out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage 15 who led you through that great and terrible wilderness in which were fiery serpents and scorpions and thirsty land where there was no water who brought water for you out of the flinty rock 16 who fed you in the wilderness with manna which your fathers did not know that he might humble you and that he might test you to do you good in the end 17 then you say in your heart my power and the might of my hand have gained me this wealth
8817829 and you shall remember the lord your god for it is he who gives you power to get wealth that he may establish his covenant which he swore to your fathers as it is this day

8817843 and one for the imaginary disease the doctors made up because they dont wanna admit that mixing all those other pills is killing me
8817844 and these three pills i take one in the morning one in the afternoon and one at night are for the imaginary disease the doctors made up to cover for the fact that were all drinking backed up piss water filled with prozac zoloft vicodin and thousands of other drugs theyve prescribed unnecessarily it was on the news a few months ago you probably missed it because everyone was worried about the spears family

8817848 sometimes the things that may or may not be true are the things a man needs to believe in the most that people are basically good that honor courage and virtue mean everything that power and money money and power mean nothing that good always triumphs over evil and i want you to remember this that love true love never dies you remember that boy you remember that doesnt matter if its true or not you see a man should believe in those things because those are the things worth believing in

8817856 we dont need four more years of the same we need hope we need change we need barack obama
8817857 deification is the attaining of likeness to god and union with him so far as is possible emphasis mine
8817858 love the divine gift perfects human nature until it makes it appear in unity and identity with the divine nature
8817859 the act and process by which people or things are cleansed and dedicated to god ritually and morally
8817860 simply replacing theosis with sanctification is an attempt to supplant patristic theology with standard reformation language theosis is seen as the telos goal of salvation and existence
8817861 the incarnation is the definitive and unique doctrine of christianity further without the incarnation there would be no theosis christians are meant not only to learn from the life of the divine son but to reproduce the pattern of spiritual progress that he revealed even to the point of taking on the character of god
8817862 to use a very weak analogy when someone not of royal blood becomes a king perhaps a bit of that royal prestige might rub off on his relatives
8817863 the divine and uncreated grace and energeiai of god is being indivisibly divided like the suns ray which warms and lightens and vivifies and increases its own splendor in what it enlightens and shines forth in the eyes of its beholders
8817864 evidence of superhuman power could suggest a human being who had joined the gods as well as a god in human form
8817865 when god is said to have made man according to his image the word man means neither the soul by itself nor the body by itself but the two together
8817866 i ask not only on behalf of these but also on behalf of those who will believe in me through their word that they may all be one
8817867 thus he has given us through these things his precious and very great promises so that through them you may escape from the corruption that is in the world because of lust and may become participants of the divine nature
8817868 that love of god and our neighbour which implies deliverance from all sin
8817869 loveth the lord his god with all his heart and serveth him with all his strength he loveth his neighbour every man as himself yea as christ loved us indeed his soul is all love filled with the bowels of mercies kindness meekness gentleness longsuffering and his life agreeth thereto whatsoever he doeth either in word or deed he doeth it all in the name in the love and power of the lord jesus in a word he doeth the will of god on earth as it is done in heaven
8817870 i will sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your uncleanesses and from all your idols i will cleanse you a new heart i will give you and a new spirit i will put within you and i will remove from your body the heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh i will put my spirit within you and make you follow my statutes and be careful to observe my ordinances
8817871 it is the circumcision of the heart from all filthiness all inward as well as outward pollution it is a renewal of the heart in the whole image of god the full likeness of him that created it
8817872 if wesleys writings on perfection are to be read with understanding his affirmative notion of
8817873 the fact that a man is being deified does not mean that he ceases to be conscious of sin on the contrary deification always presupposes a continued act of repentance a saint may be well advanced in the way of holiness yet he does not therefore cease to employ the words of the jesus prayer lord jesus christ son of god have mercy on me a sinner father silvan of mount athos used to say to himself keep your mind in hell and despair not other orthodox saints have repeated the words all will be saved and i alone will be condemned eastern spiritual writers attach great importance to the gift of tears orthodox mystical theology is a theology of glory and of transfiguration but it is also a theology of penitence
8817874 outward signs words or actions ordained of god and appointed for this end to be the ordinary channels whereby he might convey to men preventing justifying or sanctifying grace
8817875 if a man asks how can i become god the answer is very simple go to church receive the sacraments regularly pray to god in spirit and in truth read the gospels follow the commandments
8817876 deification is not a solitary but a social process we have said that deification means following the commandments and these commandments were briefly described by christ as love of god and love of neighbour
8817877 if you had told me you were heading this way id have set up an appointment with your dads lawyer ill phone him in the morning so you can sign the papers
8817878 the papers allowing me to buy your half of the property
8817879 youre assuming i want nothing to do with the ranch
8817880 not an unreasonable conclusion seeing how youve avoided the ranch
8817881 i promised my father that if anything ever happened to him id permit the homestead more than a passing thought before i walked away from it for good
8817882 as soon as you figure out what you want let me know just stay out of my way until you do
8817883 sometimes we depend on other people as a mirror to define us and tell us who we are and each reflection makes me like myself a little more
8817884 theres something delicious about writing the first words of a story you can never quite tell where theyll take you mine took me here where i belong

8817933 due to similarities in the wording of the statements and the manner of suicides as well as statements made by other detainees interviewed
8817934 there was growing concern that someone within the camp delta population was directing detainees to commit suicide and that additional suicides might be imminent
8817935 the cells of other detainees were searched during the week following the suicides in an attempt to find evidence regarding whether the suicides had been part of a larger conspiracy which might result in additional detainees also taking their lives
8817936 additional handwritten notes found in cells other than those where the suicides took place
8817937 and other documents reveal that the men took advantage of lapses in guard protocol and of lenient policies toward compliant detainees to commit what suicide notes described as an attack on the united states
8817938 investigators found that guards had become lax on certain rules because commanders wanted to reward the more compliant detainees giving them extra t shirts blankets and towels detainees were allowed to hang such items to dry or to provide privacy while using the toilet but were not supposed to be able to obscure their cells while sleeping guards told officials that it was not unusual to see blankets hanging in the cells and that they did not think twice when they passed several cells on the night of june 9 2006 with blankets strung through the wire mesh authorities believe the men probably hanged themselves around 10 p m but they were not discovered until shortly after midnight on june 10

8817940 a mid to high level al qaeda operative who had key ties to principal facilitators and senior members of the group
8817941 although many of the individuals apprehended during the raid have strong connections to al qaeda there is no credible information to suggest ahmed received terrorist related training or is a member of the al qaeda network
8817942 senior pentagon official who read the report and provided details in exchange for anonymity
8817943 that the navy investigation found the simultaneous suicides to be acts of defiance and martyrdom
8817944 left unexplained one key question why guards had not checked on the men for two and a half hours before they were discovered hanging in their cells
8817945 tours of the prison camps have described a strict doctrine that had guards check on each detainee every few minutes
8817946 its simply astounding that it took the government over two years to conclude a so called investigation of three men who died in a small cage under the governments exclusive control the investigation itself is what needs to be investigated along with the people whove perpetrated the disgraceful extra constitutional detentions
8817947 several of the detainees had had a vision in which three of them had to die for the rest to be freed
8817948 they have lost hope in life they have no hope in their eyes they are ghosts and they want to die no food will keep them alive now even with four feeds a day these men get diarrhea from any protein which goes right through them
8817949 said that dinner had come early that evening and that everyone in the block suddenly got tired and had fallen asleep even though it was never quiet in the block at that hour even when the guards left us in peace there was always someone who couldnt fall asleep who wanted to pray or who kept waking up throughout the night
8817950 the metal shutters in front of the windows had also been closed from the outside as if a storm were approaching
8817951 he had been woken up in the middle of the night by a loud bang
8817952 we didnt think that could be true he would have had to attach the noose to the sharp metal lattices with his hands and feet tied and with no chair to stand on that was nearly impossible
8817953 it seemed highly unlikely that the guards would have failed to catch him in time
8817954 they barely let us out of their sight for a minute
8817955 the guards claimed he had covered the walls of his cage so that they hadnt seen him do it but what was he supposed to have used to cover the cage the same sheets with which he allegedly hung himself
8817956 it was not unusual to see blankets hanging in the cells
8817957 and what about the rule prohibiting us from hanging anything on the walls of our cells
8817958 it seemed too much of a coincidence that the other two dead men had hung themselves at exactly the same time in exactly the same way in the same block while all the other inmates had been sleeping like babies when the guards were patrolling the corridors it never took long before other guards came to ensure we were following the rules the guards never took a break since they too were kept under surveillance to ensure that they too were carrying out their duties
8817959 and what about the sharpshooters in the watchtowers hadnt they noticed anything
8817960 didnt seem to have much of a reason for killing himself
8817961 no we prisoners unanimously agreed the men had been killed maybe they had been beaten to death and then strung up or perhaps they had been strangled
8817962 if prisoners died in guant namo it would create trouble for the bush government and they wouldnt have to take part in the war

8818003 wahai orang orang yang beriman puasa diwajibkan kepada kamu sebagaimana diwajibkan pula kepada orang orang sebelum kamu agar kamu menjaga diri dari kejahatan
8818004 cara dan motifnya berbeda beda tergantung kepada iklim kebangsaan peradaban dan keadaan lain tetapi sulit sekali untuk menyebut puasa suatu aturan agama yang samasekali tak dikenal
8818005 menyuruh kepada para pendeta supaya sekurang kurangnya menjalankan puasa lima tahun sekali
8818006 dan apabila kamu puasa janganlah kamu menyerupai orang munafik dengan muramnya tetapi engkau ini apabila engkau puasa minyakilah kepalamu dan basuhlah mukamu

8818015 according to the 2001 land law the lake itself should be inalienable state land so its ownership cannot be transferred for longer than 15 years during which time the function of the property must not change
8818016 many of the families have strong legal claims to the land under the land law
8818017 we are very concerned what will happen to our houses and livelihoods and the possibility that we will have to move
8818018 we ask the company to halt the process of filling in the lake and meet the community to discuss the issue
8818019 i think i speak for all families when i say the boeung kak lake area is very easy to live in
8818020 even poor people can make a living catching snails in the lake the water is polluted but this is being used as an excuse to force people out in the name of development
8818021 i want to stress the compensation offer is not acceptable to the people
8818022 if the government wishes to develop boeung kak they should do so through a legal process with the participation of communities that live around the lake
8818023 there is an expectation that a lot more evictions will happen and that evictions in the works for some time will now get the green light
8818024 we are concerned that a number of evictions could be carried out after the election and we call on the government to respect the laws of cambodia and their international human rights obligations

8818043 yes it would be a very bad place and i bet i know who lives there too
8818044 a scale from 1 to 10 with 10 being outstanding or perfect and 0 being very poor

8818047 shouting sucks after each name announced in the other teams starting lineup
8818048 sometimes being here at duke because weve been very very successful they expect you to be perfect they dont look at process anymore
8818049 its like what we havent gone to the final four what we didnt win the national title very spoiled and it ruins it a little bit really a lot
8818050 part of that then becomes you win and sometimes youre just relieved to win
8818051 im not saying that it happens all the time but it happens at the end of that spain game most people would say werent you relieved no i wasnt i was exhilarated it was euphoric it was the way it should be thats the way its going to be for the rest of my career here at duke
8818052 as you know im a believer and ive never pretended not to be and i respect those who have no religious belief its a free country
8818053 for me its ultimately the order of the cosmos or what i describe as the creation
8818054 you cant simply have in my own judgment creation simply being a random event because it is so inherently ordered and the fact that the natural environment is being ordered where it can properly coexist over time
8818055 if you were simply reducing that to mathematically probabilities ive got to say it probably wouldnt have happened
8818056 so i think there is an intelligent mind at work
8818057 we are all cups constantly and quietly being filled the trick is knowing how to tip ourselves over and let the beautiful stuff out
8818058 at some point i believe one has to stop holding back for fear of alienating some imaginary reader or real relative or friend and come out with personal truth
8818059 just a minute im talking to daddy okay now what is it you need

8818073 if you dont have it you can get it if you have it you can lose it
8818074 when you do start growing it really is easy to lose it
8818075 its so easy to start focusing on numbers and start looking at the big picture rather than focusing on some of the individual stories and neglecting your individual relationship with god
8818076 make sure you dont fall so in love with success that you fall out of love with jesus

8818082 let me think about it a little bit i dont know if i would use taxpayers money im not informed enough on it let me find out im sure i have taken a position on it in the past i have to find out my position on it i am sure i am opposed to government funding i am sure i support the presidents policy on it

8818088 there are many books that promise to reveal jonathan edwards insight into the christian life this book delivers dane ortlund artfully using the incisive and perennial thought of edwards points us to a christian obedience that is indeed a whole hearted delight
8818089 dane does a marvelous job of demonstrating how the new sense of the heart divinely and graciously imparted by god governs edwards understanding of motivation in christian obedience i highly recommend ortlund s clear and insightful study of it
8818090 dane ortlund has sat at the feet of jonathan edwards and has learned much of what moved edwards to be the person he was as we read these pages we will be led to the same internal relish for god that transformed edwards life theology and ministry

8818117 wahai manusia sungguh telah datang kepada kalian bulan allah yang membawa berkah rahmat dan maghfirah bulan yang paling mulia di sisi allah
8818118 lalu amirulmukminin ali bin abi thalib berdiri dan berkata ya rasulullah amal apa yang paling utama di bulan ini rasul yang mulia menjawab ya abul hasan amal yang paling utama di bulan ini adalah menjaga diri dari apa yang diharamkan allah swt
8818119 inilah bulan yang ketika engkau diundang menjadi tetamu allah dan dimuliakan oleh nya
8818120 barang siapa yang menahan kejelekannya di bulan ini allah akan menahan murkanya pada hari dia berjumpa dengan nya
8818121 siapa yang melakukan salat sunat di bulan ramadhan allah akan menuliskan baginya kebebasan dari api neraka barang siapa yang melakukan salat fardu baginya ganjaran seperti 70 salat fardu di bulan yang lain
8818122 barang siapa yang memperbanyak salawat kepadaku di bulan ini allah akan memberatkan timbangannya pada hari ketika timbangan meringan
8818123 barangsiapa pada bulan ramadhan memberi makan kepada orang yang berbuka puasa maka itu menjadi ampunan bagi dosa dosanya dan mendapat pahala yang sama tanpa sedikit pun mengurangi pahala orang lain mereka para sahabat berkata wahai rasulullah tidak setiap kami mempunyai makanan untuk diberikan kepada orang yang berbuka puasa beliau berkata allah memberikan pahala kepada orang yang memberi buka puasa meski dengan sebutir kurma seteguk air atau sesisip susu barangsiapa memberi minum orang yang berpuasa maka allah akan memberinya minum seteguk dari telagak dimana ia tidak akan haus hingga masuk surga
8818124 betapa banyak orang yang berpuasa tapi mereka tidak mendapatkan apa apa dari puasanya kecuali lapar dan dahaga
8818125 ketika aku sedang berhotbah datanglah malaikat zibril dan berbisik hai rasullullah aamin kan doa ku ini
8818126 ya allah tolong abaikan puasa ummat muhammad apabila sebelum memasuki bulan ramadhan dia tidak melakukan hal hal yang berikut tidak memohon maaf terlebih dahulu kepada kedua orang tuanya jika masih ada tidak bermaafan terlebih dahulu antara suami istri tidak bermaafan terlebih dahulu dengan orang orang sekitarnya
8818127 barangsiapa yang tidak berniat puasa sebelum fajar maka tiada baginya puasa itu
8818128 dan makan dan minumlah kalian sampai jelas bagi kalian putihnya siang dan hitamnya malam dari fajar
8818129 fajar itu ada dua adapun yang pertama maka dibolehkan makan dan tidak boleh melakukan sholat sedang yang kedua maka diharamkam makan dan dibolehkan sholat
8818130 termasuk kebidahan yang mungkar adalah apa yang terjadi pada masa ini yaitu mengadakan azan yang kedua kira kira sepertiga jam sebelum fajar dalam bulan ramadhan dan mematikan lentera lentera sebagai alamat untuk menghentikan makan dan minum bagi yang ingin berpuasa dengan persangkaan bahwa apa yang mereka perbuat itu demi kehati hatian dalam beribadah hal seperti itu tidak diketahui kecuali dari segelintir orang saja hal tersebut membawa mereka untuk tidak azan kecuali setelah terbenam beberapa waktu lamanya untuk memastikan masuknya waktu menurut persangkaan mereka lalu mengakhirkan buka puasa dan mempercepat sahur maka mereka telah menyelisihi sunnah rasulullah oleh karena itu sedikit sekali kebaikan mereka dan lebih banyak kejelekan pada diri mereka
8818131 jika telah datang waktu malam dari arah sini dan pergi waktu siang dari arah sini serta telah terbenam matahari maka orang yang berpuasa telah berbuka
8818132 yang membedakan antara puasa kita dengan puasa ahli kitab adalah makan sahur
8818133 sesungguhnya dia adalah berkah yang diberikan allah kepada kalian maka jangan kalian meninggalkannya
8818134 sahur adalah makanan berkah maka jangan kalian tinggalkan walaupun salah seorang dari kalian hanya meneguk seteguk air karena allah dan para malaikat bersalawat atas orang orang yang bersahur
8818135 kami bersahur bersama rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam kemudian beliau pergi untuk solat
8818136 dan makanlah dan minumlah kalian sampai jelas baggi kalian benang putih siang dari benang hitam malam dari fajar
8818137 barangsiapa yang tidak meninggalkan berkata bohong dan beramal dengannya maka allah tidak butuh dengan usahanya meninggalkan makan dan minum
8818138 sesungguhnya nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam mendapatkan fajar subuh dalam keadaan junub dari keluarganya kemudian mandi dan berpuasa
8818139 manusia akan senantiasa dalam kebaikan selama mereka mempercepat buka puasanya
8818140 agama ini akan senantiasa menang selama manusia kaum muslimin mempercepat buka puasanya karena orang orang yahudi dan kristen nashrani mengakhirkannya

8818162 people were killed and theyre building on top of their bones
8818163 new orleans has experienced a profound change in who governs schools and a dramatic reduction of parent and local taxpayer control of schools
8818164 50 of them are charter schools privatized management governed by self appointed self perpetuating boards 33 are run by the state department of education through the recovery school district and only five are governed by the elected school board
8818165 there are now 42 separate school systems operating in new orleans
8818166 school policies including teacher requirements curriculum discipline policies enrollment limits and social promotions publicly accountable schools in which parents have methods for publicly redressing grievances are limited to only five schools 5 6 percent of the total
8818167 but the people down here need the world to understand that its still a tragic situation the rent has tripled the health care system is in shambles we have less access to education for our kids the working class and poor are being exploited while everyone at the top is getting fat off our misery

8818173 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
8818174 i know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk they claim that our insistence on something larger something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a trojan horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values and thats to be expected because if you dont have any fresh ideas then you use stale tactics to scare the voters if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from you make a big election about small things

8818186 sebenarnya kalau di pejabat pun sama ustaz kita kena fikir selangkah ke depan kalau dah selesai kerja hari ini kena siapkan bahan bahan untuk mulakan kerja esok kalau kerja cleaner di hotel tisu tisu dan bahan yang sudah diagihkan ke bilik kena dilengkapkan semula stoknya supaya mudah untuk kerja esok
8818187 maknanya kita tidak perlu hafal etika orang jepun ini kalau kita tahu cara berfikir mereka maka secara semulajadi sahaja kita akan buat perkara perkara tersebut betul tak

8818192 there are lots of things i dont understand say the latest debates over whether neutrinos have mass or the way that fermats last theorem was apparently proven recently but from 50 years in this game i have learned two things 1 i can ask friends who work in these areas to explain it to me at a level that i can understand and they can do so without particular difficulty 2 if im interested i can proceed to learn more so that i will come to understand it now postmodernist theorists derrida lacan lyotard kristeva etc even foucault write things that i also dont understand but 1 and 2 dont hold no one who says they do understand can explain it to me and i havent a clue as to how to proceed to overcome my failures

8818196 these are not merely theoretical issues they have urgent practical political consequences as is evident from the conventional feelings of first world subjects that existentially or

8818201 anyone who believes that the laws of physics are mere social conventions to try transgressing those conventions from the windows of my apartment
8818202 my concern over the spread of subjectivist thinking is both intellectual and political intellectually the problem with such doctrines is that they are false when not simply meaningless there is a real world its properties are not merely social constructions facts and evidence do matter what sane person would contend otherwise and yet much contemporary academic theorizing consists precisely of attempts to blur these obvious truths the utter absurdity of it all being concealed through obscure and pretentious language

8818220 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president
8818221 our nation was enjoying peace and prosperity some assumed we would continue both no matter the outcome but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8818222 may be even more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
8818223 the same policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous with john mccains support president bush and vice president cheney have led our nation into one calamity after another because of their indifference to fact their readiness to sacrifice the long term to the short term subordinate the general good to the benefit of the few and short circuit the rule of law
8818224 before he entered the white house abraham lincolns experience in elective office consisted of eight years in his state legislature in springfield ill
8818225 the experience lincolns supporters valued most in that race was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
8818226 he was known chiefly as a clear thinker and a great orator with a passion for justice and a determination to heal the deep divisions of our land he insisted on reaching past partisan and regional divides to exalt our common humanity in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition

8818233 eight years ago barack obama went to the convention in los angeles did any of you go there some of you went to los angeles i was out there well he went there and didnt have a delegate badge or a super delegate badge in fact he really couldnt get in he went to the airport to rent a car and they rejected his credit card and he talked them into taking it anyway so he gets a car and he drives in and he cant get inside finally somebody says well i can get you a ticket to go into a skybox i cant get you on the floor he was a state senator at the time and he got in the skybox and he watched it on television and he packed up and he left before thursday hed run out of money heading back to chicago to his family that was the story of the los angeles convention
8818234 hi i wanted to let you know that iowa will be well represented in the front row of invesco tonight some of senator obamas hardest working iowa supporters jan bauer of ames peggy whitworth of cedar rapids and nancy bobo of des moines have front row seats to senator obamas speech

8818236 when we met that day it was just paul and emily and they were interrupted repeatedly with phone calls of the first staff arriving in iowa
8818237 i remember when we were 45 points down last summer at one point and this hope we speak of didnt look so apparent on the horizon and you know there were just so many people who worked so hard to get to this point

8818251 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
8818252 its hard to believe that the us would sabotage the deal at this stage after having initiated the deal and gone out of its way to placate india
8818253 in any case india was involved in negotiating every phrase in the resolutions brought before the iaea and the nsg its futile for india to blame the us it was at best naive for it to trust washington to do everything at the nsg
8818254 you can bet that there are some lawmakers who want to bring in amendments
8818255 a large number of countries big and small expressed views similar to new zealands that there needed to be compatibility between the us india agreement and the goals of the nsg the discussions last week were robust and constructive
8818256 while new zealand remains a strong advocate of the npt and the comprehensive test ban treaty and would welcome indias accession to these we have not included these in our package of proposals
8818257 in no way prejudge s the decision on a possible india specific exemption in the nsg
8818258 although the statement was a clear warning indian negotiators ignored it
8818259 they thought a combination of us strong arm pressures and indias new with us or against us diplomacy would do the trick
8818260 based on concepts already enshrined in un security council resolutions in domestic legislation of nsg member states and in bilateral nuclear supply agreements which they have concluded over the years
8818261 the us will probably try to persuade india to accept at least one of the three proposed conditions namely exclusion of enrichment and reprocessing technology
8818262 it is hard to say if india will agree to this while accepting a periodic review of its non proliferation commitments and cessation of cooperation in case of an indian nuclear test
8818263 that the nsg dissenters will be satisfied with such a modified draft the chances of the deal going through before the present term of the us congress ends seem low
8818264 american people we heard you loud and clear during the primaries you like mccains independence his experience his strong domestic and foreign policy capabilities but you want us to remember our conservative roots and to make sure were continuing on our path of building the american economy through the strengths of small business mitt romney is here to tell you that those voices are heard
8818265 american people you shouted at the tops of your lungs that you liked both of our platforms so it is natural that the strongest platform will combine the voices of your two public servants

8818271 observing the judicial investigation by the retired justices of the supreme court of the court of appeals philippines justices allegedly involved in anomalies concerning the meralco gsis case a few days ago reminded me of the need for judicial reform and the envisioned modest contribution of the chief justice enrique m fernando foundation towards that end
8818272 the foundation thus embarks on the project called excellence in magistracy and fidelity to law research project which aims to improve the standards of the philippine legal profession by providing judges and lawyers a research online publication similar to that of lexisnexis or westlaw this would greatly facilitate the research required to arrive at a sound or correct decision in a given case a close collaboration and partnership between the foundation the philippine judicial academy the supreme court library the u p college of law and the u p law center have already been set up
8818273 the solution of judicial corruption is not easily accomplished there must be greater vigilance by the authorities such as the office of the court administrator and also by members of the bar it is the main contention of this article that an essential component in the solution lies in the improvement of legal research materials

8818300 saya tidak pernah melihat rasulullah berpuasa sebulan penuh selain di bulan ramadhan dan saya tidak pernah melihat beliau banyak berpuasa selain di bulan syaban
8818301 maka datanglah sesudah mereka pengganti yang jelek yang menyia nyiakan shalat dan memperturutkan hawa nafsunya maka kelak mereka akan menemui kesesatan kecuali orang orang yang bertaubat dan beramal shalih
8818302 celakalah bagi orang orang yang shalat yaitu orang orang yang lalai dalam shalatnya
8818303 sesungguhnya mereka adalah orang orang yang bersegera dalam mengerjakan perbuatan perbuatan baik dan mereka berdoa kepada kami dengan harap dan cemas dan mereka adalah orang orang yang khusyu kepada kami

8818306 orang kuat bukanlah orang yang selalu menang ketika berkelahi tapi orang yang kuat adalah orang yang bisa menguasai diri ketika marah
8818307 puasa itu perisai diri apabila salah seorang dari kamu berpuasa maka janganlah ia berkata keji dan jangan membodohkan diri jika ada seseorang memerangimu atau mengumpatmu maka katakanlah sesesungguhnya saya sedang berpuasa
8818308 barangsiapa tidak meninggalkan perkataan dusta perbuatan az zur maka allah tidak membutuhkan perbuatan orang yang tidak bersopan santun maka tiada hajat bagi allah padahal dia meninggalkan makan dan minumnya
8818309 puasa ini bukanlah hanya menahan diri dari makan dan minum saja akan tetapi juga dari dusta dari perbuatan yang salah dan tutur kata yang sia sia
8818310 bicara dulu baru berpikir bukan sebaliknya berpikir dulu disaring baru diucapkan
8818311 barangsiapa menyambung tali persaudaraan silaturrahim di bulan ini allah akan menghubungkan dia dengan rahmat nya
8818312 maka apakah kamu mengira sesungguhnya kami menciptakan kamu secara main main saja dan kamu tidak akan dikembalikan kepada kami maka maha tinggi allah raja yang sebenarnya tidak tuhan yang berhak disembah selain dia tuhan yang mempunyai arsy yang mulia
8818313 sesungguhnya telah datang bulan ramadhan yang penuh berkah allah telah memfardhukan atas kamu berpuasa di dalamnya dibuka semua pintu surga dikunci semua pintu neraka dan dibelenggu segala syetan di dalamnya ada suatu malam yang lebih baik dari seribu bulan barangsiapa tiada diberikan kebajikan malam itu maka sungguh tidak diberikan kebajikan atasnya
8818314 sesungguhnya allah mencintai orang orang yang berperang di jalan nya dalam saatu barisan yang teratur seakan akan mereka seperti bangunan yang tersusun kokoh
8818315 wahai orang orang beriman bertaqwalah kepada allah dan hendaklah setiap diri memperhatikan apa yang telah diperbuatnya untuk hari esok dan bertaqwalah kepada allah sesungguhnya allah maha mengetahui apa yang kamu kerjakan

8818367 politik itu tremendum sed fascinosum menakutkan tapi menarik namun kalian tidak perlu takut dengan politik
8818368 meski para pelaku politik cenderung membuat politik menjadi sesuatu yang negatif di mata masyarakat politik itu pada dirinya sendiri bagus

8818372 saya kini paham bahwa politik itu sesuatu yang mulia yang bisa dipakai sebagai alat untuk membawa masyarakat ke jalan keselamatan
8818373 selain teologi dan filsafat kami para frater juga perlu memahami politik karena bagaimanapun kami akan turun ke dunia nyata
8818374 seminar ini perlu bagi kami yang akan menjadi misionaris di negara lain tentu saja orang akan menanyakan kepada kami tentang situasi politik di indonesia karena orang lebih mengenal kami sebagai orang indonesia
8818375 untuk memberikan masukan kepada para frater dan juga imam agar mereka tidak sekedar belajar filsafat dan teologi tapi harus mengetahui situasi politik di tanah air

8818387 ladies and gentlemen of the class of 97 wear sunscreen if i could offer you only one tip for the future sunscreen would be it the long term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience i will dispense this advice now enjoy the power and beauty of your youth oh never mind you will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until theyve faded but trust me in 20 years youll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you cant grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked you are not as fat as you imagine dont worry about the future or worry but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum the real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind the kind that blindside you at 4 pm on some idel tuesday do one thing every day that scares you sing dont be reckless with other peoples hearts dont put up with people who are reckless with yours floss dont waste your time on jealousy sometimes youre ahead sometimes youre behind the race is long and in the end its only with yourself remember compliments you receive forget the insults if you succeed in doing this tell me how keep your old love letters throw away your old bank statements stretch dont feel guilty if you dont know what you want to do with your life the most interesting people i know didnt know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives some of the most interesting 40 year olds i know still dont get plenty of calcium be kind to your knees youll miss them when theyre gone mayber youll marry maybe you wont maybe youll have children maybe you wont maybe youll divorce at 40 maybe youll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary whatever you do dont congratulate yourself too much or berate yourself either your choices are half chance so are everybodys elses enjoy your body use it every way you can dont be afraid of it or of what other people think of it its the greatest instrument youll ever own dance even if you have nowhere to do it but your living room read the directions even if you dont follow them do not read beauty magazines they will only make you feel ugly get to know your parents you never know when theyll be gone for good be nice to your siblings theyre your best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future understand that friends come and go but with a precious few you should hold on work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle because the older you get the more you need the people who knew you when you were young live in new york city once but leave before it makes you hard live in northern california once but leave before it makes you soft travel accept certain inalienable truths prices will rise politicians will philander you too will get old and when you do youll fantasize that when you were young prices were reasonable politicians were noble and children respected their elders respect your elders dont expect anyone else to support you maybe you have a trust fund maybe youll have a wealthy spouse but you never know when either one might run out dont mess too much with your hair or by the time youre 40 it will look 85 be careful whose advice you buy but be patient with those who supply it advice is a form of nostalgia dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal wiping it off painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than its worth but trust me on the sunscreen

8818390 i think its quite clear looking at the documents and looking at the body of evidence that it was primarily a marketing exercise i think if merck was upfront about the purpose of the trial many people wouldnt have participated
8818391 i think people in the industry had felt well maybe you can get away with running these kinds of seeding trials whos going to find out nobodys bothered its kind of a no harm no foul thing but if it shows up in litigation that you didnt do what you were supposed to do in designing the trial and getting consent from subjects or approval from irbs institutional review boards you open yourself up to a huge amount of liability i think it will have a chilling effect that way
8818392 theres nothing inherently wrong with doing a marketing study you can but its hard to get somebody to say ok im going to agree to sign up for a study so we can figure out if doctors are more likely overall to prescribe a than b most people dont want to be bothered with that but if you put this kind of a question what influences prescription behavior next to a legitimate science question thats how i think these studies will trend

8818394 we confess that we evangelicals have betrayed our beliefs by our behavior
8818395 all too often we have attacked the evils and injustices of others such as the killing of the unborn as well as the heresies and apostasies of theological liberals whose views have developed into another gospel while we have condoned our own sins turned a blind eye to our own vices and lived captive to forces such as materialism and consumerism in ways that contradict our faith
8818396 evangelical christians have had this pattern of either giving up on the culture or we try to take it over
8818397 it is not up to us to win all the victories it is not given unto us to try and impose our will on a whole society but rather to witness to the kind of justice peace and righteousness that is part of what it means to be a disciple of jesus christ working alongside people of other faiths and of no faith for the common good
8818398 why do you call me lord lord and do not do what i say i will show you what he is like who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice he is like a man building a house who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock when a flood came the torrent struck that house but could not shake it because it was well built 49but the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation the moment the torrent struck that house it collapsed and its destruction was complete
8818399 as for the person who hears my words but does not keep them i do not judge him for i did not come to judge the world but to save it there is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words that very word which i spoke will condemn him at the last day for i did not speak of my own accord but the father who sent me commanded me what to say and how to say it

8818496 it raymonds open source concept accepted the idea of commercial interests from the start
8818497 it saw new business models evolving from shared development effort
8818498 isnt open source a community based movement that was set to overtake the world of commercial software wasnt the famous lamp stack linux apache mysql and perl python and php going to open a world in which software existed outside the traditional realm of property
8818499 it is almost impossible to tell the difference between the most popular open source software and commercial alternatives
8818500 what tends to get lost is this the fact that business is friendly to foss does not mean that it has adopted its values
8818501 the free software camps concern with philosophical and political freedom has almost certainly not been adopted by most foss friendly companies while the open source camps emphasis on increased software quality is probably shared by middle management at best business gasp is interested in foss to improve the bottom line and often no other reason
8818502 there isnt a grand contradiction between giving code away seeding the market and suggesting a purchase reaping the market in fact the two go together perfectly as we realize this open source will become even more dominant open source and business can be bosom buddies not enemies
8818503 sooner or later an open source business is going to act more like a business and less like a citizen of the foss community
8818504 the two can certainly co exist and both can benefit from doing so but forced to choose the average foss based business is going to choose business interests over foss every time
8818505 well i was certain i was going down the right road but now see that my choice was in error
8818506 ill take it to my grave that i am right

8818509 well then mr smarty pants what do you think about that
8818510 the greatest minds in the body of christ are the ones who understand the concept of supernatural revelation no one is perfect at it but those who are the closest to kingdom truth understand that it comes by way of revelation knowledge in times of intimacy and relationship just reading the bible is not enough they understand that what is true in gods mind so far outweighs what we conclude as truth here on earth they understand that in order to be right in the kingdom is to have first heard and then concluded but how is one to discern whether the voice they are hearing is that of the holy spirit or of the devil and the flesh the answer is in experience that starts with faith those who experience what they read in the bible are the ones who hunger and thirst for more of the lord they are the ones who hear the voice of love and know instantly the difference between the voice of love and light as compared to the voice of hate and darkness but it takes the experience to even first hear the voice of the father speaking thru the son and by way of the holy spirit one must be baptized in the holy spirit to know

8818522 open source vendors start making money from their customer base precisely at the point that the customer base is least likely to renew
8818523 howlett suggests that software vendors are right to charge a big upfront license fee as it helps to defray the high initial cost of supporting a customers deployment of the software
8818524 open source vendors get around this by pushing for multi year agreements which is a way of evening out risk and fairly apportioning it between vendor and buyer
8818525 on the it buyers side a subscriptions price is likely to be higher on an annual basis than the maintenance on a proprietary license in the first year a subscription is dramatically cheaper but over five years or how about just in the second year or third its no longer so clear cut
8818526 if dennis is right and customers turn against enterprise software support and maintenance models then how many customers are going to be able to distinguish commercial license plus support subscription from commercial license plus maintenance contract

8818658 why did you deceive us by saying we live a long way from you while actually you live near us 23 you are now under a curse you will never cease to serve as woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my god
8818659 your servants were clearly told how the lord your god had commanded his servant moses to give you the whole land and to wipe out all its inhabitants from before you so we feared for our lives because of you and that is why we did this 25 we are now in your hands do to us whatever seems good and right to you

8818665 ketika ada populasi besar orang muslim yang bersiap untuk menggunakan kekerasan anda berada dalam masalah
8818666 kereta api di london dan madrid tidak diledakkan oleh umat nasrani dan budha tapi oleh muslim jadi kepada merekalah kita harus waspada
8818667 ekstrimisme islam memang menjadi masalah global yang serius tapi sangat salah jika tiap individu muslim dicurigai atau dipandang negatif secara keseluruhan

8818669 memberikan pernyataan bahwa muslim tak diterima dan menjadi biang kekerasan justru akan memisahkan mereka dari masyarakat australia sendiri khususnya bagi generasi mudanya ini juga akan menyuburkan sentimen anti barat yang semakin meningkat katanya
8818670 imigran muslim memiliki reputasi dalam memanipulasi nilai nilai negara barat mengambil keuntungan dari keramahan dan toleransi mereka
8818671 anda tidak boleh membiarkan imam imam fundamentalis datang ke sini saring mereka 1 000 kali sebelum diterima dan setelah diterima saring apa yang mereka katakan di dalam masjid beberapa orang muslim ingin menegakkan syariah di negeri non muslim yang mereka diami dan ketika propaganda itu tidak berhasil mereka melakukan intimidasi

8818677 saya menentang pawai obor olimpiade karena datang dengan penindasan kejam terhadap orang orang uighur
8818678 china menggunakan kesempatan sebagai tuan rumah olimpiade 2008 untuk menghancurkan legitimasi penduduk uighur dan perjuangan mereka serta untuk melegalkan penindasan di turkistan timur
8818679 pemerintah china seharusnya tidak diizinkan menggunakan perang melawan teror atau keamanan olimpiade sebagai front medang tempur untuk mengeksekusi orang orang uighur
8818680 persidangan itu tak lebih dari sekedar cara untuk menekan kebebasan agama dan kelompok suku minoritas
8818681 tidak ada kedaulatan yang diberikan hal ini demi mindanao dan negara lebih baik melakukan dialog daripada berperang
8818682 penangguhan sementara ini mengecewakan kami semua kepada ma kami akan menjelaskan kasus ini mengapa kami harus melanjutkan penandatanganan memorandum perjanjian bagi wilayah nenek moyang yang berada dalam hukum kami
8818683 milf menembakkan sekitar selusin mortir terhadap posisi militer kami membalas serangan itu namun tidak ada laporan mengenai adanya korban
8818684 kami memberi tenggat waktu 24 jam kepada orang orang itu milf agar mengosongkan wilayah yang mereka tempati secara paksa kalau tidak mereka akan dipaksa meninggalkan wilayah itu kami tidak bisa membiarkan hal itu terjadi

8818706 jesuit education is faithful to the teachings of the church especially
8818707 the united states will soon see their most sacred institutions fall one after the other if the americans continue to send their sons and daughters to the jesuit colleges and nunneries
8818708 rid me and deliver me from the hand of strange children whose mouth speaketh vanity and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood

8818732 the word of god is always most precious to the man who most lives upon it
8818733 the word of god is always most precious to the man who most lives upon it as i sat last year under a wide spreading beech i was pleased to mark with prying curiosity the singular habits of that most wonderful of trees which seems to have an intelligence about it which other trees have not i wondered and admired the beech but i thought to myself i do not think half as much of this beech tree as yonder squirrel does i see him leap from bough to bough and i feel sure that he dearly values the old beech tree because he has his home somewhere inside it in a hollow place these branches are his shelter and those beech nuts are his food he lives upon the tree it is his world his playground his granary his home indeed it is everything to him and it is not so to me for i find my rest and food elsewhere with gods word it is well for us to be like squirrels living in it and living on it let us exercise our minds by leaping from bough to bough of it find our rest and food in it and make it our all in all we shall be the people that get the profit out of it if we make it to be our food our medicine our treasury our armourv our rest our delight may the holy ghost lead us to do this and make the word thus precious to our souls

8818753 the immediate health risk could be an infection and the second risk would be to traumatizing the skin
8818754 also if youre using an infected needle youre looking at the risk of hepatitis and hiv
8818755 it takes one treatment to put this on its going to take multiple treatments to remove it
8818756 i like the idea of having an idea having your friend being able to execute it for you and i cant really regret those sort of things
8818757 well do them from sunrise to sunset when people have had a few drinks and its the weekend
8818758 it emanates from that blood brother pack that everyone has its that tribe mentality
8818759 people maybe dont understand cross contamination they might not be careful and they might pass something on to a bud
8818760 with no guidelines out of someones house you dont really know what each individual is going to do
8818761 even in someones shop you dont know if theyre following the safety procedures but its definitely less likely in someones kitchen
8818762 ive been auditioning since i was seven years old im tired of auditioning in fact why should i have to go in an audition if the directors not showing me how he sets up the lights or if a director isnt showing me how he moves a camera along a dolly

8818764 im going out to his barn and shoot one of his mules

8818768 make no friendship with an angry man and with a furious man do not go lest you learn his ways and set a snare for your soul
8818769 sometimes when im sitting in my car at a stop light i imagine myself as luke skywalker and i close my eyes and concentrate on using the force sometimes i have to concentrate longer than others but i know it works cause the light always turns green
8818770 no one has seen god at any time if we love one another god abides in us and his love has been perfected in us

8818772 most men hope to go to heaven when they die but few it may be feared take the trouble to consider whether they would enjoy heaven if they got there
8818773 sanctification is absolutely necessary in order to train and prepare us for heaven most men hope to go to heaven when they die but few it may be feared take the trouble to consider whether they would enjoy heaven if they got there heaven is essentially a holy place its inhabitants are all holy its occupations are all holy to be really happy in heaven it is clear and plain that we must be somewhat trained and made ready for heaven while on earth when an eagle is happy in an iron cage when a sheep is happy in the water when an owl is happy in the blaze of noonday sun when a fish is happy on the dry land then and not till then will i admit that the unsanctified man could be happy in heaven
8818774 jim johannsson spokesman for telus said the company was not forcing customers onto other plans and would continue to honour the connect 75 unlimited option for those already signed up
8818775 these are not typical or normal users their activities are placing extreme demands on the network that are simply way beyond reasonable
8818776 unfortunately we have to take action imagine an all you can eat buffet where one customer comes in and loads all of the potatoes in a giant basket and takes it out to his car as the restaurant owner you have to deal with the issue to ensure your other customers are able to enjoy their dinner we have to take action to protect the other 99 9 per cent of our customers
8818777 as we contacted those customers we found that some were well aware that they were violating the terms of service and were not surprised to get a call from us just like the wired internet we know that some abusers employ a strategy of moving from carrier to carrier and abusing the services until they get caught
8818778 they also tend to be the most vocal on online blogs claiming that their rights have been violated
8818779 customers who cancel their service can do so without penalties and return their aircards for a full refund johannson added
8818780 its a sad day when you have this much money spent on police officers and the poor only have their voice and we cant allow that to be taken from us
8818781 if i could personally solve poverty id love to but the park rules are the park rules
8818782 we adhere to a higher law and thats god and hes ok with it
8818783 we think it doesnt make sense for the richest country in the world to have such disparity
8818784 for some of these people coming to st paul and sleeping in an encampment is no different than what they would be doing in their hometown
8818785 hopefully were going to have freedom of the press and that reporters will not be man handled just because they want to cover the story
8818786 to tip the scales away from freedom of information expression freedom of the press
8818787 i hope people realize poor people do have a voice and do politically matter
8818788 this division of classes will get greater and greater until people stand up and fight
8818789 i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8818790 i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans
8818791 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8818792 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8818793 to end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaida and the taliban in afghanistan
8818794 not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8818795 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8818796 have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8818797 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president
8818798 our nation was enjoying peace and prosperity some assumed we would continue both no matter the outcome but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8818799 well i know something about close elections so let me offer you my opinion i believe this election is close today mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8818800 the objective reality is that apple does plenty of wrong
8818801 very few companies have this kind of iconic status where anything they do even if it is mediocre will automatically have a halo around it
8818802 there was no going back at that point but after i sold it i quickly started to regret it

8818804 the developing world is not going to keep up the frenzied pace weve seen

8818824 some countries may object to what were doing on principle on the grounds that they may not recognize our sovereignty i expect that we will get co operation for the most part on reporting because i think it ultimately is in everybodys interest to ensure that there is some kind of authority in the area some kind of environmental and commercial authority
8818825 were increasing our coast guard fleet we will be increasing our capacity to intercept and detain those who dont respect the reporting requirements
8818826 these measures will send a clear message to the world
8818827 canada takes full responsibility for environmental protection and enforcement in our arctic waters
8818828 as an environmental matter as a security matter and as an economic matter we are making it perfectly clear that not only do we claim jurisdiction over the canadian arctic we are also going to put the full resources of the government of canada behind enforcing that jurisdiction

8818833 when we asked in an open ended exercise what is the most important issue in deciding your vote for president a full majority 55 percent said the economy jobs everything is clustered in that area
8818834 that was followed by the war in iraq which is as much an economic issue in these voters minds because were spending 2 billion a week there rather than focusing on our needs at home
8818835 it is far more about the republican rhetoric which has damaged them deeply
8818836 there is nothing that will be easy about the next few months
8818837 he needs to visit more he needs to campaign more in the west
8818838 he needs to put more resources in the west more volunteers more offices
8818839 our campaign for a year leading up to iowa was focused completely on iowa
8818840 one of the things the campaign takes a lot of pride in is something we like to call the enthusiasm gap between our supporters and mccains supporters
8818841 our supporters are a lot more enthused but i wouldnt necessarily say thats the case with hispanics because theyre still getting to know him
8818842 we think if we win colorado new mexico and nevada barack obama is president of the united states

8818871 that the only ppm market with mrc accreditation is houston a market with in person recruiting which arbitron has indicated they will not use in any other markets it appears that in trying to rush out ppm arbitron is sacrificing the accuracy of the data if any of the pieces are wrong then the overall outcome will be wrong therefore if hispanics are not properly represented then all of the stations in the market will be impacted and the losers in the end are listeners
8818872 on august 13 2008 four of the countrys top 10 hispanic markets including the number one market officially received their first pre currency ppm report broadcasters are now seeing that some spanish stations increase their ratings and rank position significantly in ppm
8818873 arbitron first debuted ppm ratings pre currency reports in new york last october and while an average of 8 percent of our hispanic panel has been replaced each month with brand new hispanics the ratings results in this market have not changed dramatically
8818874 today the hispanic ppm sample has also improved to a point where for the past several months in new york it has consistently out performed the diary on nearly every measure
8818875 our work is never done and we will continue to put forth an earnest effort to work together with broadcasters and agencies to improve areas that can benefit from it
8818876 at the same time that we look to the future i want to take this opportunity to point out the facts on ppm samples today in the wave of markets rolling out now ppm has the largest local market electronic media ratings panel ever maintained the hispanic sample size is more than twice the size of the current nielsen lpm hispanic panels
8818877 the spanish dominant hispanic ppm sample across all 10 deployed markets including new york and l a is over representative of the hispanic population and performs higher than the diary the average ppm proportionality in june 2008 was 119 percent where 100 is the goal the diary method achieved 101 percent in the last survey available survey for all of these markets
8818878 hispanic panelists agree to participate in our ppm panels in higher percentages than non black non hispanics we cannot say the same thing about the diary service
8818879 spanish dominant ppm panelists participate in higher percentages each day than any other panelists we cannot say the same thing about the diary service
8818880 ppm includes individuals in cell phone only homes whereas the diary does not these panelists tend to be hispanic and young the cell phone only population is a fast growing segment of the population and will be an increasingly important part of our panel
8818881 hispanic 18 34 year olds ppm panelist counts in june are at or above target in 8 out of 9 of our panels six are over 100 percent two are over 97 percent and only nassau suffolk is below target but climbing the diary service is not performing at this level
8818882 our hispanic customers have asked for additional panel characteristics and controls in ppm such as country of origin more discrete language weighting by age groups and in home in person coaching these measures and controls do not exist in our diary service and they would be yet another way that our electronic service will surpass all former radio ratings collection systems
8818883 despite the facts noted above a concern has been raised that ppm
8818884 be made right those who have not had an opportunity to see the facts but have seen the headlines in industry trade magazines might assume there is a bias against hispanics in the ratings the reality is that in ppm hispanics have the highest listening levels of any ethnic group hispanic stations have among the highest time spent listening in ppm
8818885 hispanic stations total weekly count of listeners increase virtually across the board in ppm
8818886 why dont my ratings look like the dairy the difference in ratings between diary and ppm has been quantified and it is because of the measurement tool
8818887 after electronic measurement the diary is the best radio survey method available and it does a terrific job of measuring core radio listening habits yet anyone who needs to understand why differences in radio listening exist between diary and ppm need only come to arbitron headquarters to view how the american public records their listening in the diaries the diary gets the job done well but there is better way to deliver more granular and timely results with accountability that advertisers demand

8818890 as you spend more time in america you all of a sudden start eating ham sandwiches and hot dogs and hamburgers
8818891 yeah average is about the worst thing you can say about somebody
8818892 its something ive got to correct it just kind of gave them the momentum early in the game after that they didnt do much as far as moving the ball and dallas cowboys running back tashard choice right breaks a tackle by minnesota vikings cornerback dee mccann to score a touchdown during the first quarter of an nfl preseason football game thursday aug 28 2008 in irving texas associated press didnt really score on us thats the one thing that i kind of gave them that at the end of the game cost us
8818893 you know me inside and out you know every bone in my body you know exactly how i was made bit by bit how i was sculpted from nothing into something
8818894 our firm decision is to work from this focused center one man died for everyone that puts everyone in the same boat he included everyone in his death so that everyone could also be included in his life a resurrection life a far better life than people ever lived on their own

8818898 my grandmother worked seven jobs to may for my sisters hernia operation
8818899 my mother went without eating food for three years so my sister and i wouldnt starve
8818900 with the win against guatemala we have put ourselves in a good situation at the start of the semifinal round i was very pleased with the way our team stuck together in a difficult environment
8818901 we need to have that same type of effort in the matches against cuba and trinidad andtobago
8818902 as mobile becomes ever more important and ever more central to peoples lives coverage is important
8818903 we dont want to just have a debate about whether the price should be five euro cents or 4 euro cents
8818904 we have got to ask about the future that may be uncomfortable for some people but i am not going to apologise for that
8818905 while the vast majority of us are happy with our mobiles and enjoy the experience there is a small but significant number who are dissatisfied
8818906 college campuses have also served an important role in promoting podcasts many colleges and universities now provide podcasts of various lecture series and important speakers on campus
8818907 some professors are experimenting with podcasts in other ways such as producing their own podcasts or having their students respond to readings and lessons by creating podcasts rather than or in addition to traditional papers
8818908 this is the most exciting thing i have ever done
8818909 we are very happy that dawn airey will start at the end of october working for five and she will make a difference
8818910 gerhard appears to have taken a bit of a punt talking about it before everything is finalised however both sides do now expect that dawn will be released early
8818911 it has been a battle going back and forth between the two parties
8818912 gerhard said at the results this week that he expects dawn to start in october that is our only comment on this
8818913 pero es solo cuesti n de tiempo pa que salga alg n crak

8818919 quienes usamos linux amamos y defendemos como sea nuestro so quienes usan windows no se preocupan por hacerlo
8818920 linux es lo mejor que existe en el mercado y windows nada que ver
8818921 podemos hacer todo lo que hacen en winxp solo con una distro gnu linux
8818922 y una mieeeeerda eso no te lo crees ni t ni linus torvalds ni la madre que pari a linux me recordais a los fans de bisbal
8818923 yeah so it said stop then someone put writing underneath of it like this
8818924 well i fancy girls i dont know about lothario im 31 im single i havent been on a date in i cant remember how long five or six months and im still single so thats how well that date went im not a lothario god no
8818925 everyone always brings this womanising thing up but its not what im about im not a womaniser ive just told you i havent been on a date for five or six months is that the behaviour youd expect from a womaniser
8818926 i wish it was all true most of it is rubbish people ive supposedly been with thats not for me to talk about ive never talked about it pamela and i are friends i spoke to her recently if people want to assume ive been going out with her they can
8818927 im indifferent to it would it make my life easier if i could go out with my friends and not have people coming up to me and asking me really intimate things about supposed relationships ive had yes i could do without that but thats the business im in im not really fussed what people think of me
8818928 i work in tv because i just want to entertain if ive made someone laugh it makes me happy i wont rest until i am the best i can be
8818929 i had to go for an audition because i didnt know if i could act or not the part wasnt big so i thought i could do it i went along and there were other actors i recognised and i thought this is embarrassing because i was thinking they were thinking get out of here tv presenter boy i was so excited when i got it
8818930 it would be foolish to say im an actor now if anything happens great but if it doesnt thats fine
8818931 she proposed to me and i didnt think she would remember in the morning because we were in a bit of a mess she was a wonderful girl and i sometimes think i made a mistake it was either my career or her and i felt i was too young to settle down i was 22
8818932 she would always say we are engaged to be married thats the whole point of being engaged i drove her up the wall
8818933 but we were heavily into sport football and squash so it seemed the natural thing to do my mother only lived two miles away so we saw her a lot i had a good upbringing good parents
8818934 the people were wonderful but the job was hell on earth
8818935 being stuck there and knowing youre not supposed to be doing that but not knowing what you were supposed to be doing it was a tough time i wasnt happy i was drinking a lot and doing all the rest of the things you do when theres nothing to do in a valleys community like that
8818936 chris came off his bike and he died which was a horrific thing to go through i cant really put it into words
8818937 he lived next door to us his parents were our next door neighbours so we had known him all our lives he died there and then in my arms after that i went to a really dark place life without him was awful i was in this shithole factory about a year later my mate tricky said youve got to get out of this throw it all in and lets go travelling round the world so thats what we did everything changed then it was the best move i ever made that was the turning point where i thought ive got to do something with my life i like that pressure to make something of myself because chris was going to be something amazing he was a beautiful talented man twelve years on theres not a day that goes by when i dont think about him so when people talk about the flirting thing i really dont care what people say about me shit like that doesnt bother me because i know infinitely worse things can happen
8818938 it was and i took that lesson on thats why i live every moment as if its the last and thats why i enjoy myself i never make plans im living right now
8818939 then there was a real lull in my career and i wasnt willing to go to bars or stumble out of chinawhite with a page 3 model that wasnt me
8818940 well i only flirt with the people i fancy or if theres comedy
8818941 nobody wants to watch some guy going he puts on a sleazy voice do you like walks in the park do you like black and white movies although that would be quite funny actually it has to be comedy flirting i want people to think that steve jones is a cheeky bitch they get it these actresses even the guy actors i flirt with some of them for a laugh why not they play along
8818942 they will have to drag me kicking and screaming out of the channel 4 building throw me into the gutter chuck a binful of rubbish on top of me and say get lost youre not welcome i love that show and i will do it until i feel its wrong for me to be doing it any longer so no no plans to finish
8818943 im definitely too old to do it but unfortunately i think im getting funnier as i get older
8818944 ive got nothing to be ashamed of i will not be judged by anyone
8818945 the mission of the new york reality tv school is to train and develop non actors
8818946 we train students to be exciting confident members of reality tv casts students will work rigorously through coaching sessions and on camera exercises in order to readily showcase the dynamic aspects of their personalities and to be able to shine showcase and supersede the expectations of cast mates producers and audience
8818947 was outside the programme so it doesnt translate into ratings
8818948 female prison beauty pageant it was done in croatia and is a big number waiting to happen its empowering to women its empowering to prisoners the whole idea of going from prisoner to hot babe is interesting
8818949 most pastors could easily fill dozens of extra hours a week with productive ministry if they simply had more time
8818950 many times in many places ive read this little piece of wisdom
8818951 but craig says you can spend an hour of quality time with someone without leaving your office isnt that enough for you
8818952 ive only got 45 minutes can you come to my office
8818953 well since i am hispanic i can relate better with the target and that positions me as an expert on this group
8818954 well i dont need to worry about it since im sure the hispanic team is covering that
8818955 miss bryan i just wanted to tell you that i used to not like school at all but since youre my teacher now i love coming to school every day
8818956 i love to laugh especially with my sisters my teacher makes me laugh too i like that
8818957 you should take up snowboarding i can imagine it now youre rushing down the hill and its bryan for the gold
8818958 what should miss bryan do now that the olympics are over
8818959 will you give us more hard words to try and figure out
8818960 yes miss bryan i like fifth grade more now but probably by the end of the year ill like you just as much
8818961 remember how we were talking about the persecuted church well i found this verse in matthew about it and i was wondering if you wanted to hear it
8818962 what troubles conservatives about hollywood is less the promotion in movies of left liberal policies than the breakdown of the old taboos
8818963 qui nes son qu ch veres ser n los hot hot heat
8818964 im not going to teach your boyfriend how to dance with you
8818965 the words on the streets and its on the news
8818966 theres nothing really new to report on senator mccains decision i think well all hear from him shortly and hopefully well be able to move forward together
8818967 mitt by far and away is the most logical pick
8818968 look at the polling nationwide the only guy that helps at all is romney
8818969 mccain has said time and again that he doesnt understand the economy
8818970 the crips and bloods are the focus for law enforcement now not only here but around the region because of the violence they perpetrate
8818971 weve started seeing more and more signs of the crips and bloods more bloods than crips
8818972 we are seeing a growing presence in the graffiti the clothing the symbols
8818973 there is some indication of activity in the district based on tagging graffiti and people flying colors and throwing signs
8818974 i think whats difficult to determine at this point is how much of that activity is associated with people who are actually bloods in sanctioned sets and people who are claiming to be affiliated but are not
8818975 they run around saying we are the ravenswood boys and everybody says so what
8818976 but if they say theyre the ravenswood bloods suddenly they have some credibility
8818977 if the current doldrums are seen to persist through fiscal 2010 we could be looking at a problem of up to 1 billion
8818978 although time will tell at this point it sure looks like we are in for a bumpy ride
8818979 i remember the players saying to themselves great decision and coach did the right thing
8818980 they felt he was doing the right thing but im not so sure they believed it we need to know we can win not just hope its not just skill and talent its a mind set the thing we need to do is change the culture here thats not an easy thing to do
8818981 a lot of people think he would change his approach but he hasnt
8818982 that shows that he has the mentality that his plan is going to work hes going to stick with it even when it gets down a lot of guys would jump ship after what happened and go a different direction but he knows what he wants to do and what this program can accomplish and were happy we have a guy who can do that for us
8818983 when its your first year on the job everything feels like a race
8818984 youre racing to install youre racing to implement youre racing to get everything done this year the race has ended were very organized theres a calmness to what were doing
8818985 i talked to texas coach mack brown who has been a head coach for 26 years he had never been in an overtime game
8818986 i was in three my first year and almost four we had the particular off the field incident and we set the guidelines of what it means to be a gopher
8818987 i thought it was a really good move putting kyle theret at cornerback at the end of the year
8818988 i liked when brewster walked the corners up on the line against indiana because he knew he didnt have anything behind it put more pressure on indiana to make plays the gophers basically went down swinging but that still gets respect from people that know football
8818989 he trusts that the freshmen have the talent to make plays
8818990 so you really want to go out there and prove that he made the right decision
8818991 coach has a real intense style and demands a lot from his players hell never stop preaching rose bowls and big ten titles but hes starting to mix his distinct style with head coaching experience i think hes shown tremendous growth
8818992 he does a good job of having a pulse of the game
8818993 im so busy worrying about what the offense is doing im not even watching much of whats happening after my guys come off the field
8818994 we have such a good staff that i really dont have to overdo my presence
8818995 one of the biggest transitions you have to make as a head coach isnt the day to day coaching a lot of times thats what gets head coaches in trouble they try to get involved too much and not let their guys work
8818996 if there is someone who wore fate on his sleeve it is barack obama
8818997 you could see it happen you could feel it it was a matter of time
8818998 a leader that god has blessed us with at this time
8818999 barry was given a lesson that he would consume over and over his unique racial ancestry made him someone who certainly was not to be ostracized or shunned far from it he was a special person worthy of others deep admiration
8819000 in my case you had this person who was almost a myth in our family about how smart he was and how well he had done in school and how well spoken he was
8819001 so that was something to live up to high expectations
8819002 on the other hand heres somebody who wasnt there and that i would come to learn was an alcoholic someone who had not treated his family well and so that was something you felt you had to make up for
8819003 and even in times of self doubt obama has hearkened back to that wisdom
8819004 very much at the root of who barack has become
8819005 the barack obama story a made for tv movie starring blair underwood as barack obama
8819006 he realized people began to respond to him in a powerful way
8819007 he had this ability immediately you sit there and say this guy there is something special about him
8819008 no matter who met him or how you met him you walked away with that impression this guy is going places i think he will be president of the united states
8819009 did i think he would become more than what he was at the time yeah he had this unique ability to make people feel comfortable around themselves and feel part of the process
8819010 if all goes well maybe he will be president of the united states
8819011 i also thought he likes people and people liked him i thought early on this was someone who could unify the country across political lines there was something about his lack of dogmatism and his problem solving ability and the ability to connect with him
8819012 so we were in the midst of one of our intensive discussions about civic engagement
8819013 and after one of these ranging discussions across the political sectors he did this tour de force summary
8819014 its true i give a good speech what can i do nothing wrong with that
8819015 who i am willing to sacrifice because we have this window of opportunity
8819016 be one of the most dynamic leaders we have seen in a long time
8819017 the thing i want to remind you is that everybody in this party knows that
8819018 you know why i say that because see before he was running right after that wonderful speech at the convention everybody wanted a piece of hope it wasnt naive then barack spent the entire fall traveling around campaigning and raising money for every single democratic race
8819019 this is the first time that the number of people traveling for labor day is greater than july 4th
8819020 people may also be traveling because its the last chance of the summer
8819021 we wanted to make sure that the treatment and control groups were as alike as possible
8819022 kids can withdraw money as soon as they have it
8819023 mark warner apparently does not want the people of virginia to have an opportunity to understand clearly where he stands on the issues
8819024 i believe the people of virginia have a right to see and hear candidates for public office discuss the issues
8819025 governor warner certainly respects the good work done by the league of women voters and we regret that we were not able to commit to their proposal
8819026 exposing voters to a rigorous debate of the critical issues facing this nation today is a cornerstone of the democratic election process in america
8819027 it is regrettable that former governor warner has chosen to deny virginians that opportunity by declining this statewide broadcast opportunity
8819028 i think the people have a right to ask what is mark warner hiding
8819029 as for me i will debate him any time and any place because i believe the people of virginia are entitled to that kind of public discussion
8819030 it is rare to be able to live out a piece of history
8819031 i want to be able to celebrate this moment with friends and family
8819032 we try to look at people as people not as black and white
8819033 in the past decade several police departments around the country have adopted programs using mobile video recording technology or video cameras mounted in their police cruisers
8819034 although the programs initially encountered some resistance as big brother oversight departments with successful programs report that video cameras have cut down on litigation and liability costs as well as improved relationships between officers and citizens during encounters
8819035 the cost of the hardware ranges from 3 900 to 6 300 per car for cameras that do not have wireless uploading capability
8819036 it catches law violations on film creates an objective record of encounters between officers and citizens and serves as an evidentiary tool in court for both criminal and civil cases
8819037 one of the chiefs priorities has been to implement technology for officers
8819038 so incrementally wed like to push for more of a presence of in car video surveillance as well
8819039 the major issue is obviously the budget these can be some expense but were exploring some grant funded opportunities for the cameras
8819040 although the department asserts it briefed all commission members individually no briefing documents specific dates or calendars were provided to auditors to verify these briefings
8819041 i am committed to increasing the departments transparency and the recommendations identified in this audit put us another step closer to realizing that goal
8819042 the people of texas deserve a world class transportation system
8819043 im hopeful this report along with recommendations made by the sunset commission will provide the legislature with a good road map for making immediate and long term improvements to our transportation system
8819044 however i must admit i am dismayed to learn that there were persons in the department who became aware of this error as early as september 2007 and yet it was not brought to the legislatures attention until early this year
8819045 was all that thievery and high dollar living worth the possibility that you might go to prison for the rest of your life
8819046 were having our lawyers review the ruling and will dutifully follow what it says were still trying to figure out what it says
8819047 local school boards can now breathe a sigh of relief
8819048 the state board of education threw them under the bus last month by refusing to adopt the clear specific standards schools need to give the bible the respect it deserves and help them stay out of court now schools wont be required to maneuver through a legal minefield without a map
8819049 texas schools are required to have some type of instruction in the bible which is the hebrew scriptures and new testament
8819050 schools are not required to offer a particular type of course in order to meet the requirement of having some type of instruction in the bible but they have to offer something
8819051 if a school district or charter school chooses to offer a course authorized by section 28 011 and fewer than fifteen students at a campus register to enroll in the course the district or charter school is not required to provide the course at that campus for that semester but that does not mean that the school is not required to comply with the curriculum requirements in subsection 28 002 a 2
8819052 for 10 years my parents have been national night out block captains and they sat outside for two hours that thursday night
8819053 on friday he wasnt feeling good and he went to the doctor who sent him to another doctor when he suspected west nile from the symptoms on saturday he was feeling worse and that night he went to the emergency room
8819054 by sunday he was on a ventilator so its been a little bit over a year since hes been home
8819055 this year has been a fairly light year compared to the previous several years
8819056 most of the time when theres a pretty intense disease transmission season it normally occurs in drier weather and not when we get a lot of rain
8819057 its a devastating disease and it virtually destroyed every muscle in his body
8819058 i never thought id see him in a wheelchair weve been to four hospitals and every one of them has done a great job
8819059 we claim the victory for barack as the first african american president of the united states
8819060 this is something i never thought i would live to see
8819061 in my lifetime i never thought i would see a black president and im only 29
8819062 he helped me remember what america used to be like because the last eight years have been demoralizing
8819063 are they feasible can he fix health care and the economy cut our dependence on foreign oil and cut taxes
8819064 hes a really good speaker hes motivational he gives that great locker room speech
8819065 hes really ingratiating himself to me who is typically republican
8819066 forty seven million people who cant go to the doctor as i can bothers me
8819067 i dont think in an acceptance speech he can go too much into it
8819068 hes trying to reach out to the anti bush republicans
8819069 whether you would call that a beating i dont know he could have hit his head on something or something could have hit him in the head
8819070 i urge texans along the coast to monitor this storm closely heed warnings from their local leaders and take necessary precautions to protect their families homes and businesses
8819071 treat others the way we would like to be treated
8819072 federal judges come with an aura from the responsibility and the position we all honor their authority the government will have to work extra hard to undermine that
8819073 these charges are extremely rare thats because this type of behavior occurring on federal property is extremely rare
8819074 the question is if she was that offended by what he did the jury will wonder why she stayed in the job all those years
8819075 i think adding on the case five years ago makes the more recent complaints less credible
8819076 this will be pretty delicate for the judge who will try the case and there will likely be a lot of recusal issues there
8819077 judges are used to a zone of privacy in their chambers that doesnt get pried into this could be awkward
8819078 my instinct is that the starting presumption of credibility that the judge has will only last so long as the objective facts support it
8819079 i cannot recall a case in which a federal judge has been charged with such serious personal felonies
8819080 if you look at the proposed ballot question it makes it look like youre supporting all kinds of wonderful educational things
8819081 the money involved is going to go to the gambling industry to the tune of half a billion dollars per year
8819082 the language doesnt pass the fairness test we believe that if you were given language saying the moon is made of green cheese you would not put that on the ballot
8819083 the secretary truly believes this has been a fair and honest process for the voter to understand the measure
8819084 one of them hit me in the back of the head one grabbed my arm i turned around with my skateboard and one hit me in my mouth and one hit me right here
8819085 could infer from the circumstances that the perpetrators intended to inflict permanent injury they intended to assault

8819226 viper sword master hikari no yaiba and my weapon serpento
8819227 too bad that viper swords arent that good against an opponent with left handed person
8819228 yes you have whew that was interesting i never thought anyone who studied the viper sword would be able to move that well against a left handed swordsman
8819229 that would most likely be true but you see my brother was a left handed swordsman and we both learned martial arts from our father
8819230 you had two masters at once trent nods and who was your brothers master swordsman
8819231 his name is master fredrick ang of the bear blade we met him and master cedric law when we were looking for strong fighters we found four but three have their own plans
8819232 whos the fourth one you found both point at trent that is funny you two knew nothing about the viper sword and brought him here to its birthplace
8819233 but hes an outsider should we let our guard down with him around
8819234 i will allow him to stay in the city as long as he is with one of four people at all times
8819235 myself so i can finish your training sara hima or hikaru are the four that you have to be with at all times until we can trust you completely like family
8819236 while youre here at least speak with the right dialect if hikari no yaiba sama is your teacher you should address him as yaiba sensei
8819237 but that takes time i wasnt really known for my patience back in akamaru village
8819238 if you are with me ill be your speaking teacher after all if you are going to live here you might as well learn about your new home
8819239 and when youre with us we can show you more jutsu including the pleasure center jutsu
8819240 but first all four of you all turn to him fix my mansion
8819241 it means thanks for the food by the way do you want to know where you are going to be living trent nods right here after all hikaru is my son and the girls are my granddaughters
8819242 this keeps getting better and better first impressions with the father and grandfather went over like a bag of lead bricks dont you think master trent
8819243 im just not having any luck today first was the polar bears on our way here then the monkeys then all the ninja and the father and grandfather of sara and hima
8819244 imagine my surprise when my granddaughters bring home a future husband right through my walls during tea and that man happens to be a viper swordsman who was taught by my own twin brother
8819245 yep in fact everyone in our family is a twin hikaru has a brother who is in harpina on the same mission the girls were on his name is troy
8819246 that name was mothers idea right hikari no yaiba sama
8819247 yes it was marys idea for troys name why she didnt want to name him yami i dont know you two are as different as light and darkness he is all business and you actually settled down and started a family
8819248 master yaiba if mister hikaru is your son why does he not call you father
8819249 after dinner we will bathe while the girls wait for their turn to bathe and since you are going to live you might as well dress like the locals hikaru go find some clothes for him i think he will need a large shirt size 30 pants and size 10 sandels

8819256 but what it really means is youre on your own
8819257 out of work tough luck no health care the market will fix it born into poverty pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you dont have boots youre on your own
8819258 i dont believe that sen mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know

8819334 dave you should get some rogain seriously or just shave your head and get it over with
8819335 but what if i dont start it should i throw something back
8819336 its only the first day of class m what can i do to help you learn
8819337 i dont think we have ever felt the level of frustration that we felt after that match was over
8819338 last season when we had preseason scrimmages it really wasnt that competitive
8819339 last year we probably had four five players who were not really up to the caliber of big ten play
8819340 we only have 11 players on scholarship we could have 12 thats our max but every one can play
8819341 lauren is probably the most competitive player on our team
8819342 if we ask them to put on their shoes she wants to be first and thats literal
8819343 part of the team was pulling in one direction and the coaching staff in another direction
8819344 and some members of the team were pulling in no direction
8819345 we prepared for this season with long painful meetings that you dont really think are necessary at the time
8819346 weve put in a lot more effort off the court making sure we are all getting along
8819347 there is so much that goes out of my reach and i have to rely on a solid senior class to take care of that
8819348 we didnt have one last year there was a lot of random behavior and we never really marshalled in one direction
8819349 thats what went wrong and thats what we fixed i think
8819350 were a better running team with taylor at tight end grant offered running the ball of course is what the eagles are all about
8819351 he is actually taking one for the team playing quarterback
8819352 ive been doing this a long time last season i didnt have any really unique decision making situations where i felt like it was a make or break decision i didnt have a decision that i felt i wasnt prepared for i mean i felt extremely prepared for the opportunity that was presented to me i didnt have one of those moments
8819353 first of all hes healthy gophers coach tim brewster said appraising vandesteegs fall camp
8819354 hes explosive coming off the ball i see him come off the ball and rush the passer and he does a great job with his hands
8819355 playing defensive line at this level you cant play with one arm he said
8819356 it just doesnt work you need both hands you have to be able to hit with both hands to shed blocks and with just one hand and the other is basically a club it just doesnt work
8819357 it was kind of like the whole right side of my body fell apart he said
8819358 they say one part of your body goes the next part goes because you overcompensate by then it was kind of like oh my gosh what else can go wrong
8819359 a couple kids started running their mouth telling me i wasnt any good the gophers werent any good he said
8819360 i take pride in what i do and i love the gophers when someone is sitting there yapping in my ear and i tell them to go away go do your own thing well you know something happened
8819361 i wasnt very happy to see him but i did go she said
8819362 ive always supported him and loved him and tried to teach him to make good choices none of us is perfect the best thing i could do for him at that point was to tell him to stand up to what he did correct it and move on with his life
8819363 you know maybe drinking didnt suit me the best he said
8819364 i probably wont ever drink again i go out now and have a kiddie cocktail people laugh but i dont need to drink to have fun
8819365 you always hear people talking about getting in trouble because other people are harassing you he said
8819366 you dont believe it can happen to you until it happens it wasnt a very good deal when it happened to me but ive learned from it i feel like im a better man because of it
8819367 i feel like i just got here and now its almost over he said
8819368 she knew i was hurt and shes a mom so she takes care of me he said
8819369 but she always said if im able to go i should go youve only got four years in high school and then four more in college so dont have any regrets just because you have injuries
8819370 he was really down he wanted to play so bad and hed worked so hard
8819371 ill be honest with you i felt like i was comfortable and i knew everything last year but until you get out there and youre doing it you have no clue what youre doing
8819372 ill be so much more relaxed and be able to just have the game come to me
8819373 whereas last year in the first game i was forcing things a little bit too much i didnt know quite what i was doing and this year i feel like there will be a better calmness throughout the whole game
8819374 it allows you to expose the defenses and you can potentially put up so many points and so much yardage against a team but ultimately it falls on the quarterback to get the team in the right place thats whats so great about the offense because all of the responsibility is on the guy calling the plays thats whats so fun about it
8819375 we know that where we were last year will be hanging over us for a while but its our job this year to be a whole new team and to continue to focus on this year and know that last year is motivation for us to become a better team and become a more successful team i guess im just really focusing and always keep reminding myself that football is just a game
8819376 you think things are going good and thats football just one play its just going to make me work that much harder
8819377 its something a little setback but ill be ready to go by next season and i plan on being ready for otas organized team activities and minicamps
8819378 well its going to definitely be a full evaluation process to elect a new president but we have some viable candidates that can do a great job

8819410 i will be with you and this shall be the sign for you that it is i who sent you when you have brought the people out of egypt you shall worship god on this mountain
8819411 if i come to the israelites and say to them the god of your ancestors has sent me to you and they ask me what is his name what shall i say to them
8819412 thus you shall say to the israelites i am has sent me to you

8819414 if your enemies are hungry feed them if they are thirsty give them something to drink for by doing this you will heap burning coals on their heads
8819415 god forbid it lord this must never happen to you
8819416 get behind me satan you are a stumbling block to me for you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things

8819424 weve been with xyz bank for 22 years and have never been late on a single payment now that things are getting tough they turn around and call my note
8819425 why would the bank turn away a loyal and good paying borrower
8819426 the typical gen x or gen y will work for seven different employers across their careers
8819427 if you consider the combination of the withdrawal behavior with that propensity for multiple employers i do think we are facing a savings challenge and crisis with this generation
8819428 our research revealed that younger generations are more likely to use credit than save for short term purchases which results in an ongoing struggle with debt management
8819429 businesses are great about supporting the kids with donations however when they buy an advertisement for these items they are not really supporting the schools
8819430 weve had businesses upset with us about hitting them up for several fundraisers
8819431 they tell us weve already donated to you and we have no idea what they are talking about
8819432 these vendors can raise over 5 000 from one printing of posters by selling ads for 150
8819433 they might send us 50 of the total profits so that they can indeed say that proceeds go to the schools
8819434 lets just say my foots got caught in the door
8819435 my focus is my training my focus is my next fight im not going to talk about retirement im not going to think about retirement i want to be 100 percent focused on the job ive got to take care of and well see after the fight how i feel
8819436 weve been calling this a shallow recession and the data today tend to support that view
8819437 but that doesnt mean they point toward a quicker recovery either
8819438 going forward whether core measures of cpi excluding food and energy would show signs of inflation would be the key factor in determining the bank of japans actions
8819439 we cleared one for sure in freeport and we are still looking into others
8819440 its better to get your ducks in a row before you make a move
8819441 how did a smart man like al gore get beaten by that jackass
8819442 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8819443 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8819444 i guess by tomorrow they will have their act a little more in order
8819445 i dont know if the republican party is looking forward to following this show
8819446 i guess i always assumed it would be harder than it was there was no ghost at my door and all i felt was disgust
8819447 hasta el d a de la resurrecci n mis amigos
8819448 it occurred to me no one in my company lives in brazoria county and none were raised here
8819449 were excited to be here brazoria county offers us the opportunity to exploit the free trade zone and we plan to do that
8819450 i feel this is a sign of things to come
8819451 the first of many new beginnings for the foreign trade zone we look forward to our relationship with gulfstream
8819452 we plan on bringing a large part of our business to brazoria county as fast as we can
8819453 were glad to have gulfstream here and to be a partner in this venture
8819454 hopefully this is the beginning of bigger and better things
8819455 they tapped on the window with the gun and got them to open the door
8819456 you dont see a lot of big city crime in little areas like this
8819457 that review has been made and action is pending before the court
8819458 to chairman dean and my great friend dick durbin and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation
8819459 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8819460 you know that saying it takes it takes a village to raise a child in the east end we raised kids together with a lot of love and thats where im from
8819461 a lot of people have moved away and people are doing a lot of great things now
8819462 so we thought lets have a reunion then more people started getting excited about it because some people havent seen each other in a real long time
8819463 thats why a lot of people know who i am
8819464 living here made my life different now i am trying to make a difference in other peoples lives
8819465 when the streetlights came on you knew it was time to run home
8819466 it was really great because it was safe and everybody was everybodys friend people walked to school together and there was a lot of unity
8819467 i think its good for them to get together and reminisce
8819468 but most have left the area to go find homes in other places
8819469 the people who lived in the east end were a close knit family
8819470 march on do not tarry to go forward is to move toward perfection march on and fear not the thorns or the sharp stones on lifes path
8819471 i nostri risultati possono cambiare il modo in cui i chirurghi plastici intervengono sulle borse la rimozione del grasso dovrebbe entrare a far parte dellintervento

8819475 i dont think risk management entered the mind of some of these financial executives it wasnt how smart they were but how fat they could get
8819476 it really feels to us that were near a market bottom
8819477 youre seeing a fight between the positive and negative factors
8819478 the money managers charge is to observe be sensitive to the excesses and avoid them and look for good companies and opportunities
8819479 when the problems are worked out with the banks and the market is resolved i think the stock market recovery will be surprisingly strong
8819480 there could be more months of decline we dont know and we dont worry
8819481 this is a dream so you can wake up and say you quit the game and saved it and everything turned out fine
8819482 the ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy
8819483 the u s manufacturing recession continued its downward trend in the second quarter and medium term prospects show only minimal improvement
8819484 the declines in these major manufacturing industries directly and indirectly depress many other industries in the sector
8819485 solid growth amid concerns over energy prices international competition and import costs
8819486 who would have thought that a half black half jewish kid would ever play here
8819487 no keep looking hell make it out the guy has survival skills and is a freakin carbo camel to boot
8819488 does karma happen because we believe in the concept of karma to begin with therefore affecting the outcome by a predilection to belief in said events happening or is karma just a handy title we gave to something that was already happening
8819489 i was hoping to get a chance to play a part in this ballgame
8819490 the battles that weve had the last few years things have gone on with the red sox it ended like it should against the red sox coming down to the last out
8819491 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8819492 demonstrates just how important it is to continue with president bushs efforts to open markets for americas goods and services
8819493 no ones doing a victory dance but what we are doing is making sure that we continue to press congress on one of the most important aspects which is free trade
8819494 the lessons of the action is when a decision is made to act accurate and timely information needs to be provided to retailers and consumers
8819495 the agency didnt hesitate to use its new authority in this case and it will not be shy about using this new tool to warn the public in the future when the health and safety of the public require this kind of immediate notice
8819496 our nation needs a change from the approach of bush cheney and mccain
8819497 america we cannot turn back not with so much work to be done not with so many children to educate and so many veterans to care for not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend
8819498 if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from
8819499 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8819500 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
8819501 brought americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington before lincolns memorial and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream
8819502 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8819503 they are counting on the american labor movement for boots on the ground and mobilization and its nice to be thought of that way
8819504 he has a lot of plans but he has not always articulated them in a passionate enough way
8819505 ive seen that message delivered its in his gut he just needs to be doing it more often
8819506 people will vote against their own economic interests out of fear out of demagoguery out of racism
8819507 what the mccain campaign has deteriorated to is scaring away voters it has created an atmosphere where there is fear and hesitance about senator obama
8819508 this election is about whether voters are comfortable voting for obama
8819509 its a big mistake for me to return to china with my kids
8819510 she does not easily show her emotions on the surface
8819511 every day i can tell she does not feel comfortable in this kind of environment
8819512 its not only strange to her but it is scary to her
8819513 my children do not receive sufficient attention from the teachers so i am very concerned that they cant catch up with the students academically
8819514 it means everything to me to return to the united states with my children
8819515 it has offended the religious feelings of many people who consider the cross a symbol of gods love and of our redemption
8819516 has offended the religious feelings of many people who consider the cross a symbol of gods love and of our redemption
8819517 laxative to lose weight told me not to tell my parents
8819518 if you cannot multitask or communicate without being passive aggressive dont even bother replying
8819519 i can be a tad difficult to work for im loud pushy and while i used to think we paid well i am no longer sure
8819520 i made a commitment to stay in the job for at least a year
8819521 i met the oldest child but not the others which my mother said was crazy to accept the job without meeting all the kids so well see
8819522 if you are fundamentally unhappy with your life you will be more unhappy if you take this job so do us all a favor and get some treatment or move to the rockies but do not apply for employment with us
8819523 also if you suspect all wealthy women are frivolous we are not for you
8819524 i have all sorts of theories on how to stack my dishwasher and if you are judgmental about ritalin for adhd or think such things are caused by too much sugar again deal break city
8819525 this follows every other technology that turns out to have information of forensic value i think what were seeing is evolutionary
8819526 oh can you take care of her oh maybe you can spare her several moments of your consideration leading up to the final destination
8819527 oh the earth is calling out i wanna learn what its all about but everything i read global warming going green i dont know what all this means but it seems to be saying wake up america
8819528 hes a hero hes going to bring pollution down to zero
8819529 i know that you dont want to hear it especially coming from someone so young
8819530 stand up ill try if you will wake up its not a fire drill
8819531 the day those tests came in we realized we had a serial killer on our hands who has been active for 23 years
8819532 everything dried up they ran out of clues they got on to other things
8819533 we cannot be so arrogant to think that everything this guy has ever done came with an lapd crime report attached to it
8819534 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks celebrities live
8819535 incident still lives in our memory in which the use of the indonesian folksong by malaysian government for their tourism tv advertisement had not surprisingly succeeded in igniting public outcry in indonesia
8819536 as well as any other folk creations alike can hardly fit into the protection of
8819537 after qualifying for the a league we will all get drunk
8819538 i wanna know all my teammates real names at the end of the season and all of charlys nicknames
8819539 if you dont have enough players i can play for you too

8819606 instead of growing membership consistent with the increased number of retirees we lost membership

8819609 may an agency indicate in a job announcement that it is seeking to recruit or hire qualified individuals with disabilities
8819610 yes agencies may include language in their vacancy announcements encouraging people with disabilities to apply for jobs specifically stating that they are recruiting qualified applicants with disabilities or indicating that they will prefer qualified applicants with disabilities for jobs
8819611 the percentage of federal employees with targeted disabilities which are severe physical or mental disabilities that historically have resulted in barriers to employment has declined each year since reaching a peak of 1 24 percent in fiscal years 1993 and 1994
8819612 in fiscal year 2007 the participation rate of people with targeted disabilities declined to 0 92 percent of the federal governments total workforce the lowest participation rate in more than 20 years

8819638 the report is little more than a collection of numbers surrounded by innuendoes and loose extrapolations the problem with doing this kind of misrepresentation is that it tells federal employees their work is not valued and their contributions are not recognized making it much harder for agencies to recruit and retain the high quality employees they need
