7770050 compre lo que quiera incluyendo la conciencia de las personas
7770051 toda la historia que a nosotros nos han contado viene del otro del mundo winka de se ores con apellidos aristocr ticos de la zona central el objetivo de este trabajo es colocar al mapuche en primera persona como gestor de su propia historia

7770058 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
7770059 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido
7770060 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
7770061 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7770062 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

7770083 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7770084 it could be that the safety benefits of driving slower are proportionately greater than the fuel economy benefits
7770085 its really very interesting that with all these efforts that have gone into building safer highways safer cars better enforcement this really dramatic change were seeing is due to economics to the price of gasoline
7770086 this is really the first time since the 1970s that people are thinking about driving and about what is the cost of an individual trip

7770090 there have been a number of incidents this year which have left a lot to be desired
7770091 id say on reflection some of the players involved might feel embarrassed about that theres no point in saying otherwise im not getting into specific cases but players have a responsibility to each other
7770092 i smile when i hear people saying the gaa is trying to take the physicality out of the games thats nonsense over the last couple of weekends weve had some good physical encounters but at times stuff is creeping in we could frankly do without
7770093 when i got there the cows that were walking towards me were just dropping into the river that was the most horrific sight i have ever seen
7770094 more like a highway bridge than a dairy farm bridge
7770095 seeing your favourite cows being washed down the river was like losing a pet dog
7770096 i couldnt believe the amount of water that was flowing
7770097 the worst thing was the one staff member to get the cows in this morning was the one with the biggest passion for cows weve ever had here he was stuffed

7770099 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7770100 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7770101 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7770102 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7770103 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7770104 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7770105 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7770106 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7770107 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7770108 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo

7770120 thats a bit of hard one its just an interest in music i have always been into music when we were at school and hip hop came out i was always the person who had the stereo playing tapes it was just a fascination with music in my opinion its the djs who create the music at the end of the day they are defining whats happening when the scene took off i was already a dj i was already into house music or techno or whatever it was when it first came out it was never really an ambition like oh i wanna be a dj it just kind of happened simply because i was into music

7770126 its life or death out there nowadays people are getting killed every day and it makes me sad and angry
7770127 were not under the illusion that there are any simple answers
7770128 it is us stepping up and acknowledging the grief and the loss its kids killing kids its a loss of life
7770129 is one part of a total community response we need to have and its a good one

7770133 have a serious lifelong obligation to form their conscience in accord with human reason and the teaching of the church by studying sacred scripture and the teaching of the church as contained in the catechism of the catholic church
7770134 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion
7770135 as catholics we are not single issue voters yet a candidates position on a single issue that involves an intrinsic evil such as support for legal abortion or the promotion of racism may legitimately lead a voter to disqualify a candidate for receiving support
7770136 secularists are wrong when they ask believers to leave their religion at the door before entering into the public square frederick douglass abraham lincoln william jennings bryan dorothy day martin luther king indeed the majority of great reformers in american history were not only motivated by faith but repeatedly used religious language to argue for their cause to say that men and women should not inject their personal morality into public policy debates is a practical absurdity our law is by definition a codification of morality much of it grounded in the judeo christian tradition
7770137 while the equity markets are currently focused on downside risks we believe there are potential offsets on the upside based on continued strength in commodity demand low inventory levels and a supply side which continues to face multiple constraints
7770138 the group continues to perform strongly and the outlook remains positive
7770139 the headline profit number is certainly well ahead of expectations and the commentary associated with numbers appears very positive at this point in time
7770140 rios exposure to the bulk commodities sector has been extremely beneficial for the company and i think that the results will be very positively received by the market
7770141 the groups performance in the first half together with our growth potential supports the boards view that rio tinto presents a very strong standalone value proposition for shareholders
7770142 although we have seen some moderation in global growth rates from tightened availability of credit the impact on our markets has been modest
7770143 toughest period of trading it has experienced in its time as a public company
7770144 the quality of rio tintos portfolio and the strength of our existing markets operations and management
7770145 overall trading was strong despite increasingly difficult economic conditions as the year has progressed particularly in the uk and the eurozone
7770146 these acquisitions represent a significant increase in the size of our business in spain and strengthen our position in this market which we entered in 2007
7770147 we miss a play and it ended up costing us a ball game go to the ninth its normally a done deal for us
7770148 he had a couple outings where he struggled but to come back against these guys is pretty good
7770149 its tough to walk away with a loss but overall i was happy with the outing
7770150 i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a u s open
7770151 its a tough tournament to win rafa has never been beyond the quarters so thats definitely the advantage i carry to the other players
7770152 i thought well its an annoyance but its not really hampering our work
7770153 and it was clear they werent upset about something in general they were upset with me
7770154 he certainly is still a person of interest that has not changed
7770155 its an open and ongoing investigation especially in light of the trial thats going on in boise
7770156 i cant say if hes anything more than a person of interest
7770157 its possible we could get close to the 3 inch mark

7770166 senator kennedy ist ein sinnbild des dienstes am gemeinwohl er wird uns furchtbar fehlen

7770183 if daw aung san suu kyi continues to refuse food from her comrades her health will be of serious concern
7770184 we have received reports from our tactical operations group in davao that they have found debris near one village
7770185 we are praying hard they are safe alive that is our serious hope
7770186 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads
7770187 hes not anti black absolutely not hes not in any way shape or form a racist
7770188 sit around and do nothing during breaks because they dont like other sports
7770189 reviewing the decision and the minister has given his support for that
7770190 obviously theres been quite a bit of community backlash against the decision so the minister just asked for them to have another look and see if thats what they really want to do the spokeswoman said
7770191 help professors move forward with as little interruptions as possible
7770192 most scientists have been exposed to this and understand what it entails
7770193 against the background of the global economic environment and increasing consolidation in the it services industry the combination with infosys represents a compelling proposition
7770194 we expect to see continuing growth in the overall demand for energy with the ongoing increase in demand from the developing world offsetting the possible impact of slower economic growth in developed countries

7770348 im so psyched about it we are shooting monday tuesday and thursday this week and its really cool
7770349 they liked it so much they are bringing us back for some encore time to beef it up
7770350 we actually just had a rehearsal at director catherine hardwickes house the other day for a new scene
7770351 i know theyve been showing it to some people and some people go i want to see a little more of this or i dont quite understand this
7770352 i wouldnt be walking tomorrow if i spilled those beans but im psyched especially about the wardrobe
7770353 it gives us a little bit of history of the cullen family they are just shooting a couple of different added scenes and the scene im in i can tell you its me and robert pattinson rosalie and emmett are in that scene
7770354 well i am going to be in the prom scene now at the very end of the film

7770366 if i could re write my wpf book i would start with
7770367 and there i knew it was time to leave him alone he has clearly thought it through end to end many times
7770368 fabrice has had a terrific impact he is a good player and i think he can get better and better
7770369 but what he has got to do is what he didnt do for us on saturday and we have spoken about it already he has got to add goals to his game and he has got to add a little bit of forward momentum to his game
7770370 he is exceptional at what he has been bought for but if he wants to get better he has got to add to that and i am sure he will do
7770371 eh im eating leh dun care dee i still look pretty with my mouth opened

7770379 they are still so strong that i can see them and chelsea being the two slugging it out again for the title
7770380 they will probably meet again in a repeat of the champions league final too i shouldnt wonder certainly i think arsenal and liverpool have it all on to finish above them
7770381 chelsea were very strong last week and united will be even stronger than they are now if they sign dimitar berbatov as i think they will in the next few days
7770382 weve been a good team over the past two seasons and im confident well be a decent team again
7770383 i went in at half time feeling quite pleased with us but we ran out of steam in the second half and people like tevez and rooney just popped the ball about when the heat went out of the game
7770384 this project is different from the other trainings because it brings a student perspective of smartsite to faculty

7770387 we anticipate tabling in several key locations during fall quarter but this is subject to response
7770388 het lijkt me een ontzettend leuk programma om te doen te leuk om waar te zijn is voor het hele gezin en ik ben een absoluut familiemens vroeger keek ik heel graag naar de leukste thuis met linda de mol en later met ron boszhard ik kon er echt de slappe lach van krijgen ik vind het super dat ik nu zelf een programma met homevideos mag presenteren daarnaast is het ook nog eens een mooie leerervaring om een quiz in de studio te doen
7770389 met de frogers effe geen cent te makken willen we op respectvolle wijze ook dit deel van onze samenleving bij het grote publiek in beeld brengen de tegenstellingen zijn hierbij groot zodat de problemen waar mensen mee kampen helder overkomen ik vind het van rene froger en zijn gezin zeer moedig dat ze aan dit programma deelnemen en zich hiermee kwetsbaar durven opstellen het biedt hen bovendien de mogelijkheid om de noodzaak en het bestaan van de voedselbank onder de aandacht te brengen een zaak die ze aan het hart gaat
7770390 het is eigenlijk triest dat er in zon welvaartsland als nederland mensen van de voedselbank moeten leven helaas is t zo voor de mensen in zulke omstandigheden kun je alleen maar respect opbrengen behalve dat dit voor ons gezin een leerzame ervaring is kunnen we hiermee ook aandacht vragen voor de voedselbank
7770391 het is een zware serie met vreselijke moordzaken toch valt er gelukkig ook vaak wat te lachen de paragnosten doen het geweldig en het is mooi om te merken dat we een waardevolle bijdrage leveren aan het verwerkingsproces van de nabestaanden

7770396 i saw that many pastors allowed themselves to be taken up with ideas that were dangerous to the church they were building a great strange and extravagant church everyone was to be admitted in it in order to be united and have equal rights i saw the holy father surrounded by traitors and in great distress about the church he had visions and apparitions in his hour of greatest need i saw many good pious bishops but they were weak and wavering their cowardice often got the upper hand then i saw darkness spreading around and people no longer seeking the true church
7770397 i saw the fatal consequences of this counterfeit church saw it increase i saw heretics of all kinds flocking to the city
7770398 we understand that asking people to allow the county to raise taxes is never a popular thing but we think the timing is optimum

7770400 with six people that escaped i would have to surmise there was some planning involved in this and thats what i want to have the investigation look into did staff miss signals did they miss signs that there was something going on did the actual day to day operations contribute to this in some shape or form
7770401 we were very pleased with this initial first shots seminar for d c residents
7770402 it shows that district residents after having their second amendment rights denied for over 30 years have a strong interest in firearms ownership

7770477 its not a case of threatening anything its just a case of recommitting ourselves to actually delivering
7770478 it hasnt amounted to very much quite frankly we are hopeful that when peter robinson returns from his holidays we will have a more substantial engagement

7770483 we remove blood vessels from the leg and a mammary artery from the chest
7770484 then we connect the veins to the coronary arteries and link them to the aorta first though we have to stop the heart
7770485 i think most people do underestimate the risk of heart disease
7770486 we know that the number of people dying from coronary heart disease chd is reducing but the number of people getting it is staying more or less the same thats because the treatments have improved and we have better access to testing and diagnosis but people arent living more healthily

7770494 at this point we believe the consensus opinion among industry professionals is that the next significant hardware refresh is unlikely to occur before 2011 and more likely in 2012
7770495 one possible exception to console timing may be nintendo which could opt to upgrade the wii with faster processing power dvd capability and or greater storage
7770496 i think its going to be far too tempting to one up your competitor because they dont think youre doing this but you really are to get it out earlier and try and get some first mover advantage

7770501 keamanan laut dengan memastikan jalur yang aman bagi pelayaran dan mendukung pendekatan internasional yang terkoordinir untuk melindungi pasokan energi adalah merupakan prioritas prioritas penting bagi nato

7770503 secara jelas suatu aliansi atas 26 negara berdaulat berarti ada 26 budaya militer dan politik yang berbeda dan ini juga berarti ada 26 perbedaan dalam realitas konstitusional kami perlu memperhitungkan hal hal semacam itu tapi kami tidak dapat menolak anggapan bahwa beberapa sekutu kami hanya memiliki tanggung jawab terbatas dan hanya pada wilayah tertentu afghanistan adalah sebuah negara negara itu adalah sebuah wilayah strategis bagi nato kami perlu sebuah strategi nato

7770505 nato haruslah menjadi tempat dimana kita bisa berbicara mengenai semua isu yang mempengaruhi masa depan kita timur tengah irak korea utara china iran hanya menyebutkan sedikit contoh
7770506 ancaman bagi keamanan dan kesejahteraan dari aliansi atlantik dapat datang dari mana saja nato harus memiliki angkatan bersenjata yang dipersiapkan untuk menangkis dari manapun ancaman itu muncul
7770507 misi afghanistan adalah sebuah investasi pada kemanan kolektif kita jika kita melakukannya dengan benar di hindu kush kita juga akan menjadi lebih kuat di kemudian hari kita terpanggil untuk mempertahankan keamanan dan nilai nilai kita walaupun amat jauh dari negeri sendiri
7770508 keterlibatan kita di afghanistan adalah sebuah keterlibatan bagi sebuah islam yang moderat
7770509 kita hanyalah memberikan islam moderat kesempatan yang layak disandangnya dan komunitas internasional mendukung orang orang yang melepaskan diri dari cengkraman kaum radikal dan dari cengkraman kaum ekstrimis
7770510 jika kita merunut garis antara barat dan yang lainnya kita dapati israel ada di sisi yang sama dengan eropa as jepang dan australia
7770511 kita memerangi musuh musuh kita di luar negeri dan tidak menunggu mereka untuk tiba di negeri kita

7770578 at the same time this is a last ditch effort trying to somehow influence u s presidential politics
7770579 i see it as another card at the negotiation table to urge the u s to remove it from the terrorism blacklist as soon as possible
7770580 such action by north korea will surely hurt foreign investor sentiment towards south korean shares even further i expect foreign exchange markets in particular to be vulnerable to the news

7770586 the protocol gets very complex but its not just saying what verifiers will have a right to do that is to visit sites but it also spells out what they can do when they visit the sites
7770587 i am not optimistic at all about whats ahead especially as implementing the verification guideline is a very difficult job where we need to coordinate the different positions and interests of the six parties

7770612 n o s o causas que foram inventadas pelo tribunal n o estamos abusando na aplica o de s mulas vinculantes
7770613 saben los representantes del r gimen que nosotros contamos con una tica distinta a la de ellos jam s hemos actuado sin que sea una justa respuesta por lo que m s adecuado ser a que no se siga actuando como lo est n haciendo en contra de los ciudadanos y sobre todo con los luchadores sociales
7770614 que el gobierno del ileg timo felipe calder n hinojosa los presente de inmediato e informe a los medios de comunicaci n a las organizacionescuentran detenidos nuestros militantes
7770615 jam s ha sido f cil enfrentar una detenci n de compa eros para la familia y amigos menos para la estructura a la que pertenec an los detenidos por lo que el comit del valle de m xico conciente de lo que esto significa se pone a la disposici n de la direcci n de nuestro partido para realizar las actividades que determinen
7770616 estos son los rostros de nuestros compa eros raymundo rivera bravo y edmundo reyes amaya detenidos desaparecidos por las fuerzas represivas del estado mexicano el 25 de mayo del a o en curso cuyo secuestro e ilegal detenci n sigue siendo negada por las distintas autoridades de los diferentes niveles el r gimen encabezado por el ileg timo felipe calder n est develando su verdadero rostro el rostro del fascismo
7770617 desde la frontera norte hasta la frontera sur de nuestra patria encontramos ejemplos lamentables como estos no s lo en las d cadas mencionadas sino en los m s recientes per odos de gobierno incluyendo el de fox y ahora el de felipe calder n sin que hasta ahora los pasados y actuales gobernantes primero del pri y ahora del pan se hayan preocupado por esclarecer presentar y liberar a los cientos de desaparecidos por razones pol ticas cu ntos delincuentes organizados son protegidos por los representantes del poder estatal o federal en turno es por esto que nuestro comit estatal se une a la demanda y exigencia de presentaci n con vida de nuestros compa eros y de todos los presos y desaparecidos pol ticos que se encuentran en alg n centro de reclusi n y de tortura clandestino de los que el estado niega tener y que todos los luchadores sociales sabemos existen en todo el territorio nacional igualmente exhortamos a todo el explotado y oprimido a continuar con la organizaci n difusi n y defensa de las demandas m s sentidas de nuestro pueblo
7770618 cu ntos a os han pasado y cu ntos pasar n esto ltimo no lo sabemos lo que s sabemos es que por muchos a os que pasen a nuestros seres queridos no los olvidaremos jam s nuestros desaparecidos asesinados y presos desde la ya para unos lejana d cada de los 70 para nosotros parece que fue ayer es por eso que ahora que dos m s de nuestros compa eros de lucha se encuentran desaparecidos sentimos c mo nuestros corazones se estremecen al recordar aquella d cada y su guerra sucia nuestro pueblo de guerrero se une a la condena de la desaparici n forzada de los luchadores sociales en el territorio nacional por lo que exigimos al gobierno de ulises ruiz gobernador repudiado por el pueblo de oaxaca y al usurpador de la presidencia de la rep blica mexicana felipe calder n hinojosa presenten de manera inmediata a todos los luchadores sociales que se encuentran en las c rceles clandestinas y cuarteles militares
7770619 ante la detenci n de nuestros militantes en oaxaca informamos al comit central que las estructuras del partido y ej rcito en nuestro estado nos encontramos agrupados como la circunstancia lo amerita y cada uno de los militantes y combatientes con la disposici n a recibir rdenes para actuar como se nos indique por lo que solicitamos a nuestras m ximas instancias de partido y ej rcito que determinen ya como proceder
7770620 informamos a nuestro pueblo al bur pol tico y al comit central que dadas las circunstancias se ha hecho el recuento de fuerzas y cada compa ero y estructura se encuentra ocupando su lugar correspondiente conscientes de que este momento demanda una estricta disciplina como producto de las convicciones revolucionarias nos reportamos en completa disposici n a las rdenes que dispongan la comandancia general y el comit central dispuestos a asumir los retos que demande la presente etapa de lucha a nuestro pueblo le preguntamos qu hacer ante la euforia de ultraderecha ante la ofensiva policiaco militar resistencia organizada combinando todas las formas de lucha o resignaci n poniendo la otra mejilla
7770621 el comit estatal del pdpr epr del estado de chiapas manifiesta que con el pretexto del combate a la delincuencia organizada y narcotr fico el gobierno de la ultraderecha representada por felipe calder n hinojosa intenta contener toda manifestaci n de oposici n a su r gimen mediante acciones fascistas asesoradas por las diferentes estructuras de inteligencia extranjeras representadas por los gobiernos m s sanguinarios de este siglo entre ellos el norteamericano el espa ol y el israel demandamos enf ticamente del comit central y bur pol tico que tome en sus manos directamente el caso de oaxaca y que determinen las decisiones correspondientes porque la militancia como dice la consigna estamos presentes y resueltos a vencer consideramos que el deber de todo militante de todo revolucionario es identificarnos en la acci n como producto de las convicciones ideol gicas son tiempo de unidad tanto en el terreno revolucionario como en la lucha popular
7770622 informamos a nuestro comit central que una vez m s cumpliremos cualquier tarea que nos demande sin importar que este gobierno para castigarnos impunemente nos llame criminales o terroristas de manera infame sin que lo seamos para justificar el terrorismo de estado que prevalece en nuestro pa s
7770623 los compa eros aprehendidos que siguen siendo torturados fueron a causa de un se alamiento aclaramos la fuerza est en la prudencia todo lo hemos resuelto privilegiando soluciones pol ticas pero tambi n el pueblo nos ha dado el derecho de la autodefensa por lo tanto podr amos cambiar de t ctica y si en esta t ctica de autodefensa la hacemos como tales agotando la soluci n pol tica y dando otro paso
7770624 hemos recibido de todos nuestros comit s estatales y regionales la disposici n de recibir rdenes por lo que se ordena a todo militante y combatiente a concentrarse a sus unidades correspondientes y mantenerse en alerta general quien no lo haga ser tomado como un desertor
7770625 por el trato que la mayor a de los medios impresos y electr nicos est n dando a nuestros comunicados existe la seguridad de que nuevamente la censura y la autocensura se aplique por comisi n omisi n o convicci n sin embargo por tica profesional no deber an detenerse en cumplir su importante labor de difundir nuestra postura ante los acontecimientos del pa s y mucho menos cuando est en juego la vida de dos luchadores sociales sin importar la forma de lucha de la cual son part cipes pero tambi n se ha contado con la solidaridad de gente honesta y con un alto valor civil para quienes se gu an en los marcos del periodismo mercantil preguntamos qu necesitamos hacer para ser considerados noticia o ser necesario que aparezcan los cuerpos de nuestros compa eros para que esto sea primicia
7770626 la presencia de los operativos militares desplegados en gran parte de nuestra rep blica no han servido para nada en la lucha contra la delincuencia organizada por el contrario se ha agudizado m s la disputa interna de los grupos de poder en los lugares donde ellos operan vinculados con los grupos del crimen organizado agradecemos la solidaridad desinteresada de todas aquellas organizaciones y personas nacionales e internacionales quienes a pesar de los riesgos y consecuencias que traigan estos pronunciamientos a favor de nuestros compa eros desaparecidos se han manifestado si el actual estado de derecho el estado de derecho olig rquico en lugar de castigar a los responsables de la represi n de las masacres de los cr menes de lesa humanidad proporciona a estos chacales protecci n e impunidad tengan por seguro que sin fecha y hora fija nuestro pueblo ejercer su leg timo derecho de hacerse justicia
7770627 resulta insultante para la inteligencia del pueblo que las autoridades estatales de oaxaca y federales pretendan eludir su responsabilidad en la detenci n desaparici n de nuestros compa eros con el c nico tr mite de
7770628 ante la actitud hip crita y fascista de este gobierno ileg timo de profundizar la guerra sucia y el terrorismo de estado como su principal pol tica contra los luchadores sociales los ponentes pol ticos y los revolucionarios ante la creciente escalada de represi n contra nuestro pueblo los luchadores sociales y activistas defensores de los derechos humanos ante la existencia de presos pol ticos y de conciencia del pa s condenados a penas y tratos inhumanos en c rceles de exterminio ante la pr ctica fascista de la desaparici n forzada de luchadores sociales ante la pretensi n del gobierno calderonista de mantener en calidad de detenidos desaparecidos a nuestros camaradas edmundo reyes amaya y gabriel alberto cruz s nchez

7770643 i think if we had a farmers market i think we would shop more and eat more produce
7770644 were already outpacing 2007 so i think were going to see significant growth
7770645 it helps the local farmer it helps the families both stretch their food dollars and makes sure they are getting access to fruits and vegetables
7770646 at this stage we cant make a formal decision on that matter as we still await a combination of reports from the referee match commissioner and the review committee upon their recommendations the psl will be able to make a decision on whether to prosecute
7770647 on the basis of the report the psl will not hesitate to have their say
7770648 if there are certain individuals in the wrong they will be dealt with until such time when we have the report in our hands we cant make any decision

7770652 i really cant thats what this is all about i want to see that i can play i havent made my decision yet but i am going to do everything i can to play thats what this is all about
7770653 i have to go make this last trip and then get back with the team and figure it all out
7770654 this is all about me playing thats all i want to do
7770655 it could be career threatening if i did play its a possibility that possibility is still open
7770656 theyre kind of surprised that ive been playing with it up to this point
7770657 i really cant thats what this is all about i want to see that i can play i havent made my decision yet but i am going to do everything i can to play thats what this is all about
7770658 i have to go make this last trip and then get back with the team and figure it all out

7770662 you need all your guys darren is an explosive player there are certain runs that he is very comfortable with well get lt back and playing
7770663 mix in sproles and mix in jacob and i think we will have a good group there
7770664 i thought sproles showed that he was really versatile with what he can do
7770665 it was good for him to get in there with the first group and get some work
7770666 it was a mismatch and we took advantage of it
7770667 billy put it in the right spot and he allowed me to go get it
7770668 it has been nice to play as much as i have in the preseason
7770669 as you can see from last week to this week i felt and played a lot more comfortable
7770670 he handled things very very well he threw some nice balls we know hes talented

7770677 we have not been a three quarterback team since ive been here but i would think especially early in the season we would be
7770678 a lot of that depends on the medical report on jim
7770679 if jims not able to go it very well could be the same jared and quinn splitting a half again
7770680 i think well ease him in and see how he practices and what hes able to do
7770681 i feel good about it if it were up to me im in
7770682 it really felt good were progressing way ahead of schedule
7770683 they warmed me up well i didnt think about the knee i rolled out quite a bit the knee didnt give at all it felt fine
7770684 hes a little bit out of shape you can see the tempo and the pace of the passing game is picking up he looks good he looks ready to go i cant see any reason he wont play im really hoping mark can hold up and hang in there and get us off to a good start
7770685 hes not way out of shape but hes not in his best shape
7770686 they both have worked really hard they both have to get ready to play this week
7770687 editors have long been battling the magic bullet theory this article basically continues all of the mis information that editors have tried to correct for a long time

7770704 you need all your guys darren is an explosive player there are certain runs that he is very comfortable with well get lt back and playing
7770705 mix in sproles and mix in jacob and i think we will have a good group there
7770706 i thought sproles showed that he was really versatile with what he can do
7770707 it was good for him to get in there with the first group and get some work
7770708 it was a mismatch and we took advantage of it
7770709 billy put it in the right spot and he allowed me to go get it
7770710 it has been nice to play as much as i have in the preseason
7770711 as you can see from last week to this week i felt and played a lot more comfortable
7770712 he handled things very very well he threw some nice balls we know hes talented
7770713 people think im old im not that old yet so hopefully those healing cells are still in there
7770714 i have every reason to believe hes going to be there so my cups half full
7770715 but its only half full because theres a chance he could miss the first one
7770716 to be able to play through those things and show up on sunday is something i take pride in
7770717 he still has reaction where once he goes for a little bit he has to watch it because it gets sore on him
7770718 hes never had a good offseason hes never had the strength hes never had the complete commitment to the offseason like hes had
7770719 i feel like its my team my offense and im taking that role
7770720 i think guys understand that and theyre buying into it this summer and im excited and getting ready for this year and trying to help guys out as much as i can
7770721 hes been through his ups and downs and i think he has taken over a leadership mentality hes the face really not only of our offense but of our whole program
7770722 hes been doing a very good job of staying with the lean foods his body is lean hes probably still around 230 pounds hes still very strong and hes cut not that there was a lot of fat but hes just more trim its very noticeable to me
7770723 in high school i didnt have a quarterback who put this much heat on it so i have to get used to it
7770724 i was relaxing and my hands were relaxing and the ball just shot through and hit me right in the face
7770725 we have some receivers who can catch and plus stafford can definitely throw the ball
7770726 thats going to help us out this season that we can run the ball at the same time as pass
7770727 everyone will get their share we have a lot of backs but at the same time a lot of people can make things happen it will just be interesting to see what everybody can do
7770728 i think we have a great chance to be pretty explosive both running and passing
7770729 if the line opens holes weve got backs who can make things happen and if they protect weve got receivers who can run by some folks
7770730 were a little bit further as a group as a team
7770731 fortunately i havent had to deal with as many issues that i dont like to deal with as i had three years ago the systems in place now and we dont have as many issues in those areas so that will free up more time
7770732 this is not something that i wanted to try to delay to make some big announcement i would prefer that nobody even asked me to be honest with you just because its somewhat irrelevant
7770733 but thats the part that i enjoy to do i just like and enjoy that
7770734 we may have to work a little bit longer as a staff during the season to get everything worked out and put ourselves in a position on saturday to give those guys a chance to have success
7770735 now were just trying to keep it up and running
7770736 we go into a game with a list of plays that we feel comfortable with and were not going to just pull a rabbit out of a hat
7770737 weve talked about fourth and 1 weve talked about third and long weve talked about third and medium weve talked about first and 10
7770738 those things are basically predetermined its just that what the defense does youre going to react to it
7770739 you can really see a lot better upstairs and see them spinning from one coverage to the next or showing a blitz and things of that nature
7770740 those are the things that coach gundy is relying on us for the eyes in the sky
7770741 being in my office and dealing with all the other issues is not fun but going in there and coaching offense is fun thats why im back involved
7770742 we just feel like its the best way to start and it can change maybe in a game or it can change maybe after a game its not like it has to be permanent
7770743 maybe a little experience came through for me at 4 all in the last set

7770745 natos mission is based on a un mandate and carried upon the invitation of the afghan government
7770746 take every precaution to try to avoid innocent civilian casualties
7770747 the government of afghanistan has repeatedly discussed the issue of civilian casualties with the international forces and asked for all air raids on civilian targets especially in afghan villages to be stopped
7770748 the issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids
7770749 there were no injuries and minimal damage to the vehicle

7770797 were very pleased to bring a newer larger ship to new orleans as well as expand our operations with new seven day western caribbean itineraries that will provide exciting new fun ship vacation options
7770798 in addition to serving as an excellent homeport for carnival for nearly 15 years new orleans is a one of a kind vacation destination and were delighted to continue our relationship with this wonderful city
7770799 the port and the entire new orleans tourism community is thrilled by carnivals decision to homeport the carnival triumph here
7770800 this community has demonstrated its resilience and proven once again it is an international tourist destination this business decision by a valued partner such as carnival only reiterates the bright future of cruising in new orleans

7770803 and when i came out colonel john had to come over the heels of another horse he definitely showed his athleticism today
7770804 even with the trip he had in the kentucky derby i dont know if we would have beaten big brown that day id certainly like to take him on again maybe in the breeders cup
7770805 a bit of a shock to us i cant make it a one man show or the tito ortiz show giving him more than a guy like fedor who is coming in here with a winning record i was disappointed i was shocked it was almost like dont even bother calling back because there is no point in making a deal here it was aggressive
7770806 the problem with signing tito is how do you judge his value now
7770807 its a balance between name and performance he knows youre after him for his name value but at the same time you know his best days are probably behind him so what are you really paying for its like buying a pair of expensive jeans and paying for a label theyre really not any better than gap jeans you just hope people notice them more but you cant make them notice
7770808 hes paid his dues hes been a champ but theres a difference between a good deal and asking for the moon if he doesnt want to go back to ufc he better take one of these deals while its there

7770814 as messrs shapiro and arthur admit in their comments the recently enacted ban on anabolic steroid use will go into effect on sept 4 2008
7770815 if i had to do it over id do it differently

7770884 letter to bishops priests consecrated persons and lay faithful of the catholic church in the peoples republic of china
7770885 not wishing to be subjected to undue control exercised over the life of the church and eager to maintain total fidelity to the successor of peter and to catholic doctrine have felt themselves constrained to opt for clandestine consecration
7770886 the clandestine condition is not a normal feature of the churchs life and history shows that pastors and faithful have recourse to it only amid suffering in the desire to maintain the integrity of their faith and to resist interference from state agencies in matters pertaining intimately to the churchs life
7770887 have consented to receive episcopal ordination without the pontifical mandate but have subsequently asked to be received into communion with the successor of peter and with their other brothers in the episcopate
7770888 the significant part played by entities that have been imposed as the principal determinants of the life of the catholic community
7770889 without claiming to deal with every detail of the complex matters well known to you
7770890 i wish through this letter to offer some guidelines concerning the life of the church and the task of evangelization in china in order to help you discover what the lord and master jesus christ wants from you
7770891 of reconciliation is supported by the example and the prayer of so many witnesses of faith who have suffered and have forgiven offering their lives for the future of the catholic church in china
7770892 us to remember the past with gratitude to live the present with enthusiasm and to look forward to the future with confidence
7770893 the church is called to be a witness of christ to look forward with hope and in proclaiming the gospel to measure up to the new challenges that the chinese people must face
7770894 the proclamation of christ crucified and risen will be possible to the extent that with fidelity to the gospel in communion with the successor of the apostle peter and with the universal church you are able to put into practice the signs of love and unity
7770895 it will be hard to say no to 1m but its not just about money its a feeling too its going to be a difficult decision

7771093 clearly we found there are federal implications otherwise we would not have notified them

7771105 i do stress that at this stage these are allegations
7771106 queensland has not been provided with any documented evidence that any child adopted into queensland was kidnapped in india

7771108 keselamatan dalam lalu lintas adalah suatu permasalahan yang serius di indonesia dan merupakan suatu isu yang sangat relevan dengan bisnis kami driving skills for life adalah suatu cara yang ideal bagi ford dan para mitra kami untuk bekerja sama dengan sektor swasta indonesia dalam mendongkrak keahlian kolektif kami dan dalam membawa perubahan dalam keselamatan berkendara di jalan jalan di indonesia
7771109 ford motor indonesia merasa sangat terhormat dapat bekerjasama dengan berbagai pihak yang terpercaya dalam bidang ini seperti iddc dan bnsp dan mendapatkan dukungan dari pemerintah indonesia dalam program driving skills for life ini bersama sama kita akan membantu menyelamatkan nyawa serta mengedukasi pengemudi tentang cara cara mengurangi konsumsi bahan bakar kami harap usaha kami ini dapat meningkatkan kesadaran akan pentingnya keselamatan di jalan bagi para pengemudi mobil indonesia
7771110 ini adalah suatu langkah yang besar dalam arahan yang tepat
7771111 di negara negara berkembang seperti indonesia motorisasi terjadi dengan sangat cepat sehingga jumlah cedera dan kematian di lalu lintas turut berkembang mencapai proporsi yang cukup tinggi jumlah orang yang berlalu lintas di jalan berkembang pesat dan sebagian besar diantaranya tidak mendapatkan pelatihan berkendara yang baik atau tidak memiliki pemahaman fundamental atas keahlian berkendara yang tepat pelatihan dan edukasi pengemudi serta peningkatan kesadaran publik mutlak diperlukan untuk menciptakan perubahan
7771112 teknik teknik yang digunakan untuk berkendara dengan aman secara esensial sama dengan teknik berkendara yang ekonomis dan irit bahan bakar
7771113 dengan demikian berkendara secara perlahan dan stabil pada kecepatan mesin yang normal tidak hanya lebih aman namun dapat juga membantu pengemudi meningkatkan efisiensi bahan bakar hingga 25 lebih irit serta mengurangi emisi co2
7771114 memberikan inspirasi dalam berkendara yang aman adalah sebuah langkah besar yang dapat kami ambil untuk mengurangi kecelakaan lalu lintas
7771115 driving skills for life akan membantu para pengemudi menyadari kondisi disekitar mereka dan menyadari dampak dari tindakan mereka terhadap keselamatan di jalan
7771116 kami senang melihat ford sebagai pencetus dalam peningkatan keselamatan berbuat sesuatu terhadap isu yang penting ini
7771117 driving skills for life adalah suatu bentuk kerjasama publik swasta yang secara efektif melibatkan organisasi pemerintahan dan non pemerintahan kami percaya hal ini akan menjadi katalis untuk tindakan selanjutnya dalam meningkatkan keselamatan di jalan seiring dengan cepatnya perubahan di jalan jalan

7771129 then in the final analysis the piece that makes us a little different is our institutions being able to retain those local packages and the revenue that is generated by them in addition to the revenue generated by the cbs and espn packages took it over the top

7771147 money they want and money they must and will have the disillusionment of many methodists with the leadership of the wesleyan conference increased the possibility of schism the primitives were more likely to go against societys norms the primitive methodist maintenance of revivalism is indicative of this for a precision team to flow in unison individual skaters must be competent at a variety of skating skills including speed footwork and presentation the team performs a program set to music with required formations including circles lines blocks wheels and intersections the teams are required to perform difficult step sequences involving a number of complicated turns this thing still occasionally breaks out it is a subject at present not well understood and which requires to be peculiarly guarded against impropriety and imposture we could stop lawsuits or debt collections

7771261 a veces me cuesta creer que pas 20 a os jugando al f tbol como profesional en equipos de un gran nivel es toda una vida
7771262 nunca se me ocurri jugar en otro equipo brasile o es algo que no podr a plantearme pas toda mi juventud en el flamengo y luego pr cticamente toda mi carrera profesional soy eternamente grato por haber participado de la etapa m s gloriosa de la historia del club
7771263 una de las condiciones que impuse fue la de que volviera a jugar como volante que era mi posici n original cuando empec en el f tbol no soy un lateral sino un volante que termin jugando ah yo sab a que tendr a m s a os de f tbol jugando en el mediocampo quer a disfrutar de eso y ya ten a clara la idea de volver al flamengo para cerrar mi carrera
7771264 yo era el nico sobreviviente de la generaci n de los a os 80 y para m fue muy especial contribuir para la copa de brasil 1990 y sobre todo el brasileir o 1992 aqu l fue probablemente mi trofeo m s especial porque supo a una dulce despedida
7771265 creo que s lo me acuerdo de un gol en contra pero fue tan rid culo que cont por muchos fue un partido del brasileir o del 1991 ante el sport de recife ellos estaban a punto de bajar a segunda divisi n y necesitaban ganar casi desde el mediocampo yo retras la pelota a nuestro arquero gilmar pero no mir antes l estaba al otro lado del rea grande la pelota entr despacito y nosotros nos quedamos mirando uno al otro perdimos 2 1 qu verguenza
7771266 pero sab a que no ser a entrenador llegu a aventurarme dos veces en esa funci n en 93 94 y luego 97 aunque lo hice por amor al flamengo porque me lo pidieron y yo nuca supe decir no
7771267 cuando viv a en italia hice algunas participaciones en programas de televisi n y en brasil asum definitivamente la profesi n a partir de la copa mundial de 1998 para m es una secuencia perfecta para la carrera de jugador porque siempre me encant el an lisis del juego

7771317 i know firsthand from my parents lives and mine that the american dream endures
7771318 and isnt that the great american story its the story of men and women determined to mold our future into the shape of our ideals
7771319 i stand her today at the crosscurrents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7771320 that is why i love this country and in my own life in my own small way ive tried to give back to this country that has given me so much
7771321 so tired and disappointed in the direction of the country
7771322 still struggling in this nation with a level of cynicism and fear that is drowning
7771323 as countermeasures in a situation where the united states violated the agreement
7771324 i will be able to dance i went to the hospital ill be fine
7771325 when i was young you had to climb a coconut tree to see the sea
7771326 every year the sea comes closer we keep moving the village and we are being pushed down to the lagoon
7771327 they just fired at the road one or two bullets bounced from the road and they hit the engine
7771328 when we left the camp they all gave us pieces of paper with a telephone number on them saying when you get back to france phone my friend phone my father phone my brother say we are here that their uncle is dead and that we are here and they have to help us that is how it began during the war in bosnia it was the same in the 45 times i went there every time we have come back from mostar or sarajevo and so on we had a list of people to call when we got home
7771329 every time we saw the same thing there is a need for victims to be able to communicate and all the non governmental organisations ngos also need telecommunications
7771330 part of the problem is that i have a big mouth
7771331 now i am more not relaxed but careful about what i say
7771332 we opened our little centre in a village school and a load of people came what was fantastic was that a few days later i remember seeing people arriving in cars to take away their family and we thought this idea is good
7771333 it was our first intervention for a natural disaster we stayed there for 10 days
7771334 the most dangerous thing we do is use the local equipment like cars and helicopters we go to poor countries and the cars are old and we drive very fast because we have to arrive very quickly the helicopters we have to use are sometimes helicopters that should not be made to fly but in an emergency you have no choice
7771335 gawker and the rest as they usually say once that happens is history but a history that has already been remarkably well documented by the hot blogger calendar contest
7771336 were hoping that people are going to be thinking beyond skin deep here and looking at other qualities that make someone hot like a persons wit intelligence writing etc in other words the reason you go back to their blog to keep reading
7771337 there is no way i was meant to be vertical yet
7771338 patiently waiting to pour the rest of the table their glass of wine the server looks to the host for a nod of approval
7771339 it just came with his nature he was always for helping people do better

7771343 this new guide is right in line with cmss efforts to make our operations transparent and accessible
7771344 like cmss new web sites hospital compare nursing home compare and others the innovators guide is a one stop shop for actionable information
7771345 storyline id like to think that once she had a few years to get over that whole enslavement thing she and eldon got together for a productive talk about management techniques
7771346 i think jimmy carter is a great statesman and i think hes done a lot to further democracy around the world and that really is his legacy
7771347 most people felt that jimmy carter was an excellent president and wonderful ambassador since he has left
7771348 but the downside was that he did not pick the best cabinet and that was his downfall
7771349 in my view when carter was elected in 76 he inherited a very bad situation that had been brewing for quite some time under the previous administration
7771350 he had a lot of high interest rates if you examine what was going on it was already in the works before he took over he happened to be there when it occurred so i dont blame him for that
7771351 he compared some of the things thats being done to the palestinians to things that happened in south africa under apartheid i dont necessarily disagree with that
7771352 i really dont think it ever hurts to talk to somebody
7771353 even if there is a number of us who dont go as far as he has with some of those meetings it doesnt negate the work hes done elsewhere
7771354 getting a six pack doesnt actually mean turning yourself into mr muscleman but these six pack exercise can also help get rid of those unwanted fats and next time your wardrobe will increased thrice more than you expect it to be

7771361 riconosce subito i veri oppositori e lo dimostr nei giorni delle ultime elezioni quando
7771362 mentre la gran parte dellopposizione dialogava o andava a rimorchio lunit ha continuato pervicacemente a proporre unaltra agenda un altro pensiero un altro vocabolario
7771363 e stata una splendida avventura speriamo che continui ancora a lungo
7771364 litalia piena di settimanali forse quello che manca un quotidiano se lunit dovesse cambiare ma prima di deciderlo dobbiamo vedere come sar il giornale diretto dalla de gregorio
7771365 hopefully i can turn things around in the one day series and get some big runs
7771366 the whole tour i have never felt badly out of form i have got a few good nuts along the way and a couple of balls i didnt see which is an interesting combination
7771367 i am not out of nick so there is no reason i cant get some big runs again
7771368 we feel that for sure but we have to come out and not worry about the opposition but our game
7771369 that has been our strength over the last two years and if we play the kind of cricket we know we can there is no reason we cant turn it around
7771370 from a team point of view it was the worst display we have had for probably two years
7771371 we have had some time to sit down and reflect and get into the nets to practice but it is more of a mental change than a skills type of thing
7771372 the guys will come out and you will see a different side we arrived at the game and played it without really thinking about it you cant do that at this level
7771373 certainly not to the standard we have played over the last two years you cant perform against top sides in the world at 65 70
7771374 you have to be close to 100 if you want to beat those sides especially the way england played such a good game all round
7771375 it was agreed by all those on the icc board during the teleconference on sunday that if there were any issues relating to scheduling then icc management would work with the relevant members boards to ensure that issues were overcome
7771376 i dont know how they can possibly reschedule it because you have to have a window of opportunity for all the cricketing nations to be available to play at a given stage next year
7771377 i would have thought it is highly unlikely to happen
7771378 i thought it was too much of a coincidence that i scored a hundred against west indies just before i got the captaincy last year and i scored another hundred the day after i gave it up
7771379 it was very much a relief i spoke to my wife on the thursday night and said i couldnt keep going like that because i was going to lose my test spot and thats going to hurt the most
7771380 its always been the thing ive wanted most in cricket to cement my test spot and i didnt want to give that away easily
7771381 ill be honest and admit the run out situation didnt help thats something that doesnt go away overnight
7771382 even though you turn around and apologise youve still got people questioning you and that hurt me quite a lot
7771383 but ive grown up all my life wanting to play cricket for england and contributing to england and it was getting to the point i was going to lose my test place i thought something has got to give here because i cant keep going like this
7771384 when i got the captaincy i said i never had massive ambitions to do the job but i thought it was a great time to take a new challenge on
7771385 ive always just wanted to be a player always wanted to play for england and i still think you can be a leader in the ranks as well ill just go back to doing that
7771386 you may say that im a dreamer but im not the only one i hope someday youll join us and the world will live as one

7771450 well get that broom out of you ass and ill think about
7771451 england is one of the richest countries in the world
7771452 the people im talking about have enormous televisions a lot bigger than my own the latest in mobile phones cars and they go and get drunk in pubs at the weekend their poverty shows in the way they feed themselves
7771453 foot in mouth chef a summers lament censorship and real men wear pink
7771454 been better than the other two alex smith and shaun hill and there hasnt really been much of a gray area his plays been better at the position than what weve had at any point in the last three years
7771455 you wouldnt know if it was his first or his 30th in a low scoring ballgame he set the tone thats what he does
7771456 if he can get himself in the right position he can definitely make plays physically he covers a lot of ground and can really get to the ball
7771457 i finally understand what it takes to be a starter at this level ive found that daily effort and attention to detail and im trying to up my level of play every day
7771458 if best stays healthy he will be the most dangerous multi purpose threat in the pac 10
7771459 best could easily eclipse 1 000 yards rushing and 500 yards receiving not to mention take a couple of returns to the house
7771460 just about any head coach you talk to in america would be concerned about those types of things were getting some guys back which is good but there have been some injuries that are hurtful
7771461 he earned it in training camp thats where we determine our starters here
7771462 its good motivation for us but that motivation is already there
7771463 we are pleased with the effort but not pleased with the outcome
7771464 there are a lot of reasons why our crowds have been small but mostly its been because we are not as competitive on the field as we need to be
7771465 didnt build that stadium for a below average football team
7771466 any way that we can get people to sample stanford football is something we need to explore
7771467 stanford was an entertaining product last year and that vibrancy and charisma winning when they are not supposed to sometimes losing when they are not supposed its entertainment the more people we expose we think theyll be happy with their investment
7771468 when the game starts im far more interested in the team and the players than how many people bothered to come it doesnt bother me until after the game is over
7771469 the thing is not only do we lose but sometimes we stink
7771470 we wont do anything until the court of appeals rules
7771471 that wasnt my choice but you still take all the flak from it
7771472 after awhile youve gotta do what you gotta do and do the best at where youre at
7771473 in such stories they never say a name just sources
7771474 do they seem like they dont like me if i was an outcast and a bad guy why would i still be around
7771475 did you hear anything after that where was the big ripple from lotts comments he said his sources said ive never seen the man in the locker room
7771476 so ive had success with every running back that ive had gores big year was more of a high point because were good friends hes like a little brother to me
7771477 im going to still roll as long as im on the field
7771478 they made pitches when they needed to weve got to tip our caps to them
7771479 weve done a good job moving runners weve had good situational hitting as well as timely hitting with two outs our pitchers have done a great job pounding the zone especially our starters
7771480 both are doing a great job this year they just induced groundballs its pretty simple he made good pitches he executed and got what he was looking for
7771481 i think i was ahead of the count on him too
7771482 ive done that a couple of times it always seems to come back and bite you i didnt make the pitches i wanted to make
7771483 in the third set of images with phelps on the left it is clear he is really pushing hard while cavic on the right is just arriving
7771484 you cant just put your fingertips on the pad you really have to push it we explained all this directly after the race to cavic and his coach
7771485 this is very simple our sport is about which athlete stops the time by pushing the touchpad
7771486 recibieron todas las ayudas del gobierno y las usaron para otros negocios o para pagar a los polleros que los llevaron al otro lado de la frontera
7771487 es el desperdicio que hicieron nada m s para dividir
7771488 they want to see if there is any interest there
7771489 and if i dont play ill be ready for the season opener against kansas city
7771490 we have a chance to get peyton activated and out to practice so well see how that goes
7771491 ive seen teams play like this when theyre 30 games out
7771492 we should all be embarrassed by the way we played the last four days
7771493 the groups operating in europe dont need a lot of money the cost of operations is very low
7771494 but they are very skilled at obtaining money and using criminal systems to do it they can collect thousands and thousands of dollars or euros in a few weeks it is beyond our control
7771495 the united states and its allies have been winning the war on the financial front
7771496 it got the entire financial bureaucracy started on a wild goose chase
7771497 theres a complete disconnect between this approach and the underlying reality of how terrorism is funded
7771498 clearly when youre dealing with groups that are self funded youre dealing with a different set of circumstances from when they put these laws in place
7771499 the bad guys after a while they realize what were doing so theyre going to alter how they do business
7771500 obviously youre not going to stop them from getting money and theyre going to be able to adapt
7771501 i couldnt believe it when they told me that this might have been connected to terrorism
7771502 thats the cleverness of these schemes to keep it under the radar
7771503 by doing this they can raise significant amounts of money fairly quickly and theres no real way to detect it
7771504 if fanaticism is the heart of modern terrorism then finance is its lifeblood
7771505 there will be no hiding place for those who finance terrorism
7771506 we will take any necessary steps and find all necessary resources to ensure whether in afghanistan or anywhere else there is no safe haven for terrorists and no hiding place for terrorist finance
7771507 i think there is a realization that they are not that effective
7771508 but they need to be seen as doing something to provide reassurance to the public that theyre doing something were living in a false paradise if you think these things will stop it
7771509 we mustnt be wooed into the idea that because attacks are costing less and less that there isnt a need for money or that it isnt being provided
7771510 its not just the money they need to make the explosive devices its the money they need for other things to support the network to recruit and to train
7771511 notwithstanding the successes weve had groups associated or affiliated with al qaeda still appear to be able to carry out an attack as and when they feel so inclined
7771512 either they had the money already when they needed it or they have no problem getting it

7771522 i have asked the uk government to recognise that if we reform our pensions finance system then they should be prepared to provide additional funding to help meet the cost of our obligations
7771523 this is a clear cut case of spending rising in england and wales in a devolved area due to a decision taken by the uk government and thus scotland should receive its fair share of extra funding

7771551 we thought about a lot of things maybe we should have thought about moving the warehouse 10 to 15 feet closer
7771552 it looks kind of close because the warehouse is so big but then you start walking back there and wow its a looooong way
7771553 anyone who understands elevation understands that you have to hit it that much farther and that much higher to get your target
7771554 its just that all of the conditions would have to be right it has to be perfect
7771555 it could have been 100 feet away its hard to hit that wall from the bench
7771556 i know i could have hit that wall in a game i almost believe i could do it right now in batting practice
7771557 it would be my mission i would never be happy until i hit the warehouse

7771589 at the same time this is a last ditch effort trying to somehow influence u s presidential politics
7771590 i see it as another card at the negotiation table to urge the u s to remove it from the terrorism blacklist as soon as possible
7771591 such action by north korea will surely hurt foreign investor sentiment towards south korean shares even further i expect foreign exchange markets in particular to be vulnerable to the news
7771592 this is a major betrayal by tsvangirai many people have died been raped tortured and had their homes set on fire for supporting him he needed to consult widely with us before hopping into bed with mugabe
7771593 tsvangirai himself withdrew from the presidential run off saying the levels of violence were unacceptable why is he prepared to walk into office via a path littered with dead bodies and broken limbs
7771594 i never trust politicians i am sure the discussions have more to do with sharing power than the interests of zimbabweans in general its more to do with power than addressing the food shortages stalking the country
7771595 more than a hundred people have died because of these politicians suddenly the politicians are shaking hands but in the countryside there is very little information people are being told to beat up any m d c supporters torture bases continue to exist while women continue to be gang raped
7771596 what the politicians are doing is very unfair in mashonaland east we are still chanting slogans like down with morgan tsvangirai and yet the main rivals are having lunch together in plush hotels people need to be told that there are new developments taking place

7771617 overall the ocz elixir is a solid keyboard at a very good price 30 retail the minor layout issues we had were just that minor nitpicks were very picky about our keyboards compared with most keyboards 30 is about average though the elixir is anything but average with the plethora of additional functionality provided true it may not have the same level of features as the logitech g15 but its also far cheaper for those that dont feel like paying too much for a keyboard the ocz elixir is a solid buy
7771618 we shared the same hotel before the match and i remember sitting in the lobby when they arrived and thinking to myself how professional the south africans looked with their tracksuits and how organised they seemed to be with kit managers and all sorts of support staff
7771619 i thought we were going to have a really tough time
7771620 it was just a wall of noise it hit me like a punch to the body

7771634 today for review ive got a very small solution to that problem from our friends at usbfever its called the worlds slimmest usb bluetooth dongle and while im not sure if its the worlds slimmest it is very very small about the size of a quarter so it will fit anywhere and you wont have some ugly big usb dongle sticking out of your computer to enable bt functionality
7771635 este oro es premio a cuatro a os de sacrificio y mucho trabajo
7771636 no es que esper semos la plata es que era el objetivo real
7771637 hemos rozado la perfecci n pero el objetivo era la plata
7771638 i was expecting that males would be getting a much higher return for their social networks but the study actually shows quite the opposite
7771639 social networks are very important for female job seekers whereas they are not so important for male job seekers
7771640 they can get information on what the actual salary range might be how desperate the company is to hire someone in to the position how many other good candidates there are in other words how much bargaining power they have
7771641 is it that employers discriminate against females and that they actually need social networks to help them feel better about hiring females because of their stereotypes about female productivity
7771642 i certainly believe that if you know people and somebody is a friend of a friend and theyre hiring you theyre going to be a little more gracious on the scale of what theyre willing to offer because the word might get back to the person they know
7771643 weve come a long way in 20 or 30 years their jaw drops and they cant believe it but when i say that its not like its equal
7771644 south african drivers were introduced to the bantam in 1983 and its still going strong 25 years later
7771645 we have to create awareness that homophobia is not acceptable
7771646 we need more police presence and safety measures not just putting a label on it
7771647 the idea is to break the monotony of therapeutic food and make people look forward to food that is served hot wholesome and tastier under the supplementary nutrition program
7771648 in 2004 5 the school dropout rate was estimated at 40 percent now it has come down to 20 percent the retention rate in higher classes in schools has also shown improvement
7771649 in primary schools the dropout rate in 2002 3 was 12 percent this came down to 2 percent in 2006 7 one of the main reasons for this was the introduction of the scheme to give three eggs a week to the students
7771650 it is not as if i am obsessed with the idea of pre packaged food but at present it is logistically impossible to provide healthy cooked meals to children in 110 000 anganwadis where is the infrastructure where is the clean water for cooking where are the storerooms what is to be done with leftover cooked food the challenge is providing an answer to all these questions to improve infrastructure and then talk about bringing down malnutrition in children
7771651 we were appalled to hear of the proposed displacement of cooked meals by pre packaged foods and biscuits any change of course especially under pressure from commercial interests would be a serious regressive step against the best interests of children
7771652 we are apprehensive that many of the recent debates about introducing packaged foods is driven by business interests and lobbies rather than any serious concern about addressing poverty hunger and poor health of a majority of children this is unacceptable and goes against the fundamental rights of children
7771653 the government thought it would be best to fight tribal power the rebels with the help of a tribal coalition
7771654 but the government made the mistake of recruiting zaydi hashid tribes that were traditional rivals of the saada based bakil this led to talk of the conflict being tribal in nature with the saada tribes backing al houthi
7771655 the sheiks of saada are the wealthiest in the country but the fighting destroyed most of their farms
7771656 the war in saada ended three days ago and god willing it will never return
7771657 the two leaders azzan and jadban provided materials especially videos for the summer religious centers in saada the materials included lectures by mohammed hussein fadhlallah a prominent lebanese shia leader and hassan nasrallah secretary general of lebanons hezbollah opposition party
7771658 their insistence on chanting the slogans attracted the authorities attention and increased government worries over the extent of the al houthi movements influence
7771659 if he had met president saleh the war might not have broken out the meeting could have eliminated salehs fears about husseins al houthi intentions
7771660 the president became convinced that his tenure was threatened by zaydi doctrine and that its restoration might leave him out of office
7771661 saudi arabia was worried about such a shia movement close to its borders
7771662 such practices have played a role in extending the war the first thing they think when they are set free is how to go and support the al houthi group
7771663 is responsible so let them withdraw and take away their bulldozers
7771664 there will eventually be no more victims of bulldozers whether they are foreign solidarity activists israelis or palestinians
7771665 all of the people harmed by these bulldozers be their names corrie cohen or kamal
7771666 god only knows what the future tools of the palestinian israeli conflict will be
7771667 the jews are the intellectual elite of the western civilization and the palestinians the intellectual elite of the arab world
7771668 it is there in theory in fact it is long dead
7771669 if arafat is willing would you agree to let me lead the dialogue
7771670 every day that passes sees new bricks on new settlements begin knows exactly what hes doing hes creating the conditions for a jewish civil war he knows that no israeli leader is going down in history as the one who gave the order to the jewish army to shoot jews out of the west bank im not
7771671 according to resolution 242 not only must israel go out but furthermore we would not allow it to build any settlements to colonize this newly occupied land which israel does in defiance of international law and if israel does we should sanction it
7771672 like 99 percent of all jews in the world you believe that when israel went to war in 1967 it was either because the arabs attacked first or because they were going to attack if i can convince you using only israeli sources that this is a complete fabrication do you believe me
7771673 if what i believe about that war is not true then everything collapses

7771693 the experience and good practice of villages like ashton hayes encouraging personal and community action to tackle climate change should be promoted and replicated more widely
7771694 there is an opportunity for defra to take the lead in encouraging rural communities to fulfil their potential to contribute to climate change mitigation and to encourage community initiatives within a local regional and national framework

7771806 im nowhere near where i want to be right now my goal is to get better each day
7771807 you work hard to live up to his expectations i tried to make sure i stayed focused over the past couple of weeks and i think i did a pretty good job of studying and staying mentally ready i havent put on any pounds and had been doing my cardio
7771808 i want to build on last year of just being physically and mentally ready for the game
7771809 i want to build on every aspect of last season
7771810 we wanted to make sure we were on the same page when i got back
7771811 i needed to get back out there make some blocks and do some things i had a general idea of how long i was going to play against the rams we played it and things went all right i felt great and thought i played pretty well
7771812 and its a flip of the coin if its going to come together
7771813 were talking to all of them to come up with the best spot
7771814 one of them said i was his favorite player i almost fell over
7771815 were proud to be serving this years us open with clean wind generated energy
7771816 by matching their electricity usage with renewable energy the usta and other sports associations across america are helping to lead the effort to address the environmental and energy challenges we face around the globe
7771817 big time sporting events provide a unique platform to educate our fans on green initiatives and we feel that the best way we can educate is to lead by example
7771818 we have a plan that will lessen the environmental impact of the event and heighten the environmental awareness of those who attend it
7771819 el estatus de estas dos regiones en georgia es un asunto para la comunidad internacional a trav s de los mecanismos de la onu
7771820 c mo avanzaremos en la cuesti n de las dos regiones y cu les son sus intereses y las de georgia debe ser abordada en negociaciones pac ficas y debates entre las partes
7771821 no one wants to be in a hole especially against a team like this thats 148 2 or whatever their record is ridiculous so it was good to get out of that without a blemish
7771822 that gives you a tremendous amount of confidence to pitch to contact
7771823 pitchers dont have many opportunities to make sweet plays so that was cool
7771824 i feel good my confidence is up my swing is getting there im not missing as many pitches as i was before
7771825 i think this happens to even the best hitters you have to keep working to get better theyve been throwing me good pitches to hit i just miss them its me nothing else
7771826 asked the prosecutor general to hold a detailed investigation to clarify the matter

7771828 we met with a wall of silence from eu states
7771829 problem der deutschen arbeitsmarktes ist nicht ein mangel an flexibilit t sondern ein berschuss an unqualifizierten kr ften
7771830 so in dieser form nicht erkennen die vermutung dass nun
7771831 an einem mangel an qualifizierten arbeitskr ften dem ein berschuss an unqualifizierter arbeitskraft gegen bersteht dieser entzieht sich jeder produktiven verwendung er will so gar nicht in eine wirtschaft passen
7771832 die wirtschaftspolitische fehlsteuerung die f r diese misere verantwortlich ist liegt lange zur ck
7771833 noch negativer wirkte sich die gezielte anwerbung unqualifizierter ausl ndischer arbeitskr fte aus nur drei prozent der ins land geholten arbeiter verf gten ber berufliche bildung die gastarbeiter besa en kaum anpassungspotenzial an neue berufe weil ihre ausbildungsf higkeit und auch die ihrer kinder und enkel durch soziale und kulturelle faktoren eng begrenzt war und ist als die massenproduktion anfang der siebziger jahre weltweit einbrach gab es immer weniger arbeitspl tze f r diese einwanderer massenarbeitslosigkeit war die folge zumal der zustrom anhielt und die neigung zur beruflichen bildung auch bei deutschen jugendlichen schaden genommen hatte

7771839 at one point last year the question came up whether large animals could also sense the earths magnetic field
7771840 but of course it is difficult or maybe impossible to do these studies in the lab
7771841 i had no knowledge of it and i certainly wouldn
7771842 i dont know if it would even work i would never cheat in the game bowlers have used sweat and polish over the years to shine the ball there is an old wives tale from past years that sunscreen and brylcreem helps the ball swing but i dont know about that
7771843 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish
7771844 it had been common knowledge in county cricket for some time that certain sweets produced saliva which when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing
7771845 i had a go at murray mints and found they worked a treat
7771846 this study shows a consistent 20 per cent increase in the risk of type 1 diabetes
7771847 it is important to stress that the reason for this is still not understood although it is possible that the caesarean section itself is responsible
7771848 its true that i spent some time regularly taking part in sessions with a psychiatrist
7771849 by the way i find it to be very normal to lie on a couch every once in a while and to let your head be straightened out and your heart
7771850 tungsten is the only rare and exotic metal that can be permanently polished the polish and finish can last 30 40 or even 50 years with gold platinum and even titanium rings you will notice varying degrees of scratching denting and surface mars however with tungsten rings the surface will maintain its original beautiful shiny finish tungsten rings will not bend

7771855 i think hes balanced his numbers in the minor leagues were good i cant say one side was stronger than the other there were no significant splits hitting from either side
7771856 its hard to say but i think hes a 25 to 30 home run guy
7771857 later in the game i felt better than i had in a long time
7771858 im glad boch stuck with me because i definitely felt stronger later in the game than i have the whole season
7771859 i had never purchased an engagement ring before and was nervous when i went to pave

7771902 rgr320ex features new handworked finishes making each guitar one of a kind for two decades the rg has reigned as the unquestioned monarch of metal guitars why because the rg has the perfect combination of fast flat necks the right pickups and pickup placement and precision tremolo systems to mete out creative destruction and because the rg has evolved and expanded along with the metal genre it was designed for which is why the 2007 rg line offers a vast selection that dwarfs anything else remotely comparable

7771980 we have decided to immediately suspend disabling our nuclear facilities
7771981 this measure has been effective on august 14 and related parties have been notified of it
7771982 north korea is trying to muddle through and delay as much as possible
7771983 at the same time this is a last ditch effort trying to somehow influence u s presidential politics
7771984 i think the timing of the hu jintao visit to south korea was very depressing to the north koreans
7771985 i see it as another card at the negotiation table to urge the u s to remove it from the terrorism blacklist as soon as possible
7771986 such action by north korea will surely hurt foreign investor sentiment towards south korean shares even further i expect foreign exchange markets in particular to be vulnerable to the news
7771987 north korea is trying to muddle through and delay as much as possible at the same time this is a last ditch effort trying to somehow influence u s presidential politics
7771988 if the bush administration and others in the international community had committed to north korea going through with the third phase of completely abandoning its nuclear weapons program well that was a pipe dream there was no way for the parties to graduate from the second phase
7771989 i think the timing of the hu jintao visit to south korea was very depressing to the north koreans that is the way they usually express themselves
7771990 north korea whether right or wrong has the understanding that even with this that washington and seoul are not in a position to react in a harsh manner this means that north korea may succeed in prolonging the process without giving up much
7771991 i think something that was quite predictable for north korea there was no other choice available other than doing what they are doing
7771992 this sudden move was not entirely unexpectable as the u s has irked north korea by delaying the removal of north korea from the list of terrorism sponsoring states and south korea and the u s did the joint military drill which was seen as a threat to the north those steps angered north korea and it seems to have come to think that they still need nuclear weapons
7771993 i do not believe that north korea whole heartedly said they will go back to the starting point in terms of denuclearization process i see it as another card at the negotiation table to urge the u s to remove it from the terrorism blacklist as soon as possible
7771994 in the last two weeks this has been a gathering storm and i think that north korea now is particularly dissatisfied that the united states has delayed the process of deleting their country from the list of supporters of terrorism
7771995 secondly i think north korea is extremely annoyed that the united states and the republic of korea launched a large scale military exercise
7771996 reports are that she approached the ips iraqi police saying she had the vest on and didnt want to go through with it
7771997 if she was forced to put on the vest or if she did it voluntarily that is still being reviewed
7771998 the surrender of the suicide bomber indicates that the iraqis are continuing to reject al qaeda and its practices
7771999 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7772000 an open time limit is not acceptable in any security deal that governs the presence of the international forces
7772001 go through a number of levers in the iraqi political system before we actually have an agreement from the iraqi side
7772002 until we have a deal we dont have a deal
7772003 we will not accept to put the lives of our sons on the line by guaranteeing absolute immunity for anybody whether iraqis or foreigners
7772004 without the approval of the iraqi government and american forces
7772005 success in iraq depends on an iraqi government that is reconciling its differences and taking responsibility for its future and a timetable is the best way to press the iraqis to do just that
7772006 i welcome the growing convergence around this pragmatic and responsible position
7772007 whenever you win wars your troops come home and our troops will be coming home but it will be dictated by the conditions on the ground and the success or the lack of success
7772008 they are still so strong that i can see them and chelsea being the two slugging it out again for the title
7772009 they will probably meet again in a repeat of the champions league final too i shouldnt wonder
7772010 certainly i think arsenal and liverpool have it all on to finish above them
7772011 i have heard nothing from wigan and i have told him he will get plenty of matches this season
7772012 he has come off the bench to score in both our first games of the season

7772059 last year the mets had a big lead and i think they kind of thought they were a much better team than us
7772060 this year all the games have been close even though theyre 9 4 against us its been close we know were definitely capable of beating them
7772061 we only got to enjoy being in first place for one day
7772062 then it was three and out that kind of sticks with you
7772063 even if we feel we can beat them weve got to play them good weve got to play them better than they do these are big games for us big opportunities

7772068 where were sitting and everything we can split with the mets and still win our division
7772069 i look at our schedule and everything and id say getting to sept 15 and being close to where we are at gives us a chance
7772070 if we can stay with them we can beat other people too
7772071 but if they dominate us they are going to put some distance between us

7772128 he can be a goofy guy but the way he carried himself in the locker room and the way brian does now taught me a lot about what we need for this season
7772129 the 04 team played with a lot of swagger and confidence

7772157 manchmal kann ich es kaum glauben dass ich 20 jahre als fussballprofi aktiv war und dabei die ganze zeit bei gro en vereinen gespielt habe das ist ein ganzes leben
7772158 ich habe nie mit dem gedanken gespielt in einer anderen brasilianischen klubmannschaft zu spielen so etwas w re mir einfach nicht in den sinn gekommen ich habe nicht nur meine ganze jugend bei flamengo verbracht sondern danach auch praktisch meine gesamte profkarriere ich bin meinem heimatklub ewig daf r dankbar dass ich mit ihm die glorreichsten zeiten in der vereinsgeschichte erleben konnte
7772159 eine meiner bedingungen dabei war dass ich dort wieder im mittelfeld spielen konnte also auf meiner urspr nglichen position denn dort hatte ich meine fussballerische laufbahn ja begonnen ich bin kein geborener au enverteidiger sondern vielmehr ein mittelfeldspieler und als solcher habe ich meine karriere auch beendet mir war damals bewusst dass ich noch viele jahre im mittelfeld vor mir haben w rde das wollte ich entsprechend nutzen und zwar bereits mit dem gedanken im hinterkopf dass ich meine aktive laufbahn auf jeden fall bei flamengo rio de janeiro ausklingen lassen wollte
7772160 ich war der einzige der noch von der spielergeneration aus den 80er jahren brig geblieben war deshalb war es f r mich etwas ganz besonderes noch einmal den brasilianischen pokal 1990 zu gewinnen und sogar ein weiteres mal den brasilianischen meistertitel 1992 zu holen jene meisterkrone ist vielleicht meine wertvollste troph e berhaupt denn es war gewisserma en mein sch nstes abschiedsgeschenk
7772161 ich glaube dass mir da nur noch ein gegentor in erinnerung geblieben ist das war allerdings derart kurios und peinlich dass es viele andere geschichten in den hintergrund dr ngte es passierte im jahr 1991 in einem meisterschaftsspiel gegen sport recife um den brasileir o recife war akut vom abstieg in die zweite liga bedroht und ben tigte daher unbedingt einen sieg ich befand mich nahe der mittellinie und spielte den ball zur ck zu gilmar unserem torwart jedoch ohne mich dabei umzusehen da gilmar aber gerade weit vor seinem kasten an der strafraumgrenze stand kullerte die kugel langsam ins netz w hrend wir uns gegenseitig entsetzt ansahen am ende verloren wir das spiel mit 1 2 was f r eine blamage
7772162 dennoch wusste ich schon bald dass ich nicht als trainer t tig sein w rde das habe ich zwei mal versucht zun chst in der saison 1993 94 dann ein weiteres mal im jahr 1997 ich habe es nur meinem verein flamengo zuliebe getan denn man hatte mich darum gebeten und ich konnte wie ich nun mal bin nicht nein sagen
7772163 als ich in italien lebte habe ich bei einigen tv programmen mitgewirkt in brasilien habe ich mich dann nach der fifa wm 1998 endg ltig f r den medienberuf entschieden f r mich war es ein geradezu perfekter bergang von der karriere als spieler in die zeit danach denn ein fussballspiel zu analysieren hat mir schon immer gro en spa gemacht
7772164 und in den 20 jahren die ich als spieler aktiv war glaube ich einiges gelernt zu haben
7772165 el giro social del gobierno dice que nadie ning n poder f ctico imperialista o medi tico puede impedir que honduras se una al alba s a honduras
7772166 somos suficientemente soberanos herencia de nuestros m rtires y por eso podemos decir al mundo que honduras no tiene que pedir permiso a ning n imperialista para suscribir el alba
7772167 el alba no nos obliga a nada sino que abre una puerta de esperanza para enfrentar las crisis internacional que nos ha golpeado energ ticamente y alimentariamente en los sectores pobres que son las grandes mayor as
7772168 pues en ese tiempo todos tienen que saber leer la palabra socialismo y capitalismo para entender la diferencia

7772177 like anything else in a primary a lot of discussions a lot of debate goes on and a lot of accusations
7772178 but its over with and now we have to move on the primary is over with and lets all unite on behalf of we dont want to hear any dissent
7772179 ramrodding bills through because youve got the clout to do so rather than because youve got arguments on your side is not a good way to do the peoples business
7772180 as bad as things are in springfield if youll go back four years to when barack was there they were not as bad
7772181 today its just reached a low and its hard to explain how it could be this bad but i dont see how you can possibly attribute that to obama
7772182 if it werent for him i doubt i would be standing here today
7772183 i think its definitely a crucial game for both programs but thats because every first game of the season is important
7772184 weve been preparing for utah state the entire offseason ive always said that its kind of like the olympics you get a lot of time to prepare for that first opponent and we wanted to take advantage of that time and prepare the right way
7772185 but i was excited about the chance to become a head coach ive been preparing for that opportunity my entire life and i was excited to be a head coach when i got the chance i would do the same thing all over again
7772186 i dont think you will see much difference between northern iowa and some of the better teams in our league
7772187 northern iowa is just as capable of any of the teams in our conference or any other opponents we play this year if you look at the power rankings i guess from what ive been told northern iowa is higher than half of our conference they are a great opponent
7772188 you never want to think you can just walk over them you think any team can win and i feel that northern iowa is a good opponent
7772189 after saturday we have some pretty great opponents you know pac 10 they have their schedule we have ours whatever happens to them happens to them we are just worried about ourselves worried about our first game i am sure that if we dont show up on saturday we could be in a dogfight with them
7772190 our first opponent northern iowa is a football team that knows how to win and they expect to win
7772191 and thats something we are preparing for we know if we miss a tackle or two on him he will be gone
7772192 i dont think you will see much difference between northern iowa and some of the better teams in our league
7772193 northern iowa is just as capable of any of the teams in our conference or any other opponents we play this year if you look at the power rankings i guess from what ive been told northern iowa is higher than half of our conference they are a great opponent
7772194 you never want to think you can just walk over them you think any team can win and i feel that northern iowa is a good opponent
7772195 after saturday we have some pretty great opponents you know pac 10 they have their schedule we have ours whatever happens to them happens to them we are just worried about ourselves worried about our first game i am sure that if we dont show up on saturday we could be in a dogfight with them
7772196 our first opponent northern iowa is a football team that knows how to win and they expect to win

7772198 in an ideal world we would all like his contract sorted out sooner rather than later
7772199 it is his contract and it is nothing to do with me it is between him and the club but in an ideal world we would all like him to get it done at the same time though he has the rest of the season in his current contract so it is not a big issue as far as we are concerned
7772200 michael is a worldrenowned centre forward and a world renowned goalscorer
7772201 when he leads out the team it sends a message to other teams it tells them we have some real quality in our side
7772202 he has scored past me a lot over the years so i know what it is like to play against him if you are playing against michael owen you know you are playing one of the best in the world we have some other good players as well but seeing michaels name on the team sheet sends out a message
7772203 its one of two chances to win something if were honest
7772204 hes not renegotiated his contract and the decision was taken out of my hands
7772205 i dont know where anton is in terms of signing for sunderland but once the club accept the bid it moves on
7772206 i am saying now that if we believe in ourselves we can finish in the top six
7772207 we play in the carling cup on wednesday against nottingham forest and we will take that very seriously but i think we are capable of matching what i did in my first season at bolton and finishing sixth
7772208 it is an exciting time to be at sunderland i didnt join because i wanted to play for a team in a relegation fight and i think people can see that now
7772209 every time i go home after training my friends call to tell me you have chosen to join the right team i believe in the coach and the future of the club is a big one
7772210 weve seen a fantastic response from our fans so far
7772211 you cant short circuit the process of holding folk accountable just because you fall in love
7772212 is a personal friend of mind im excited as a black man about this moment
7772213 the closer you get to power the more truth gets sacrificed
7772214 i recognize that barack obama is not trying to be a black president but there ought to be an urban agenda
7772215 after the 21st after his inauguration youre still going to lose your house
7772216 i understand the love that black people have for obama i get that
7772217 i think the way you make the president a good president is when you make them acountable
7772218 i didnt know about yeovil before i came to england of course i didnt
7772219 but i have learned enough since to be glad we have a home game against them i have learned that beating smaller english clubs is hard but it would be harder if we were away from home
7772220 at the riverside we should win but if we are going to progress we cant afford to think we have won it
7772221 its a big match for us its hard to qualify for europe through the league because there are a lot of clubs spending a lot of money
7772222 its hard for a club like us to get into the european places but in a cup anything is possible
7772223 if we can win a few games starting with yeovil we will be well on our way
7772224 ill be treating it exactly the same as the walsall game but people on the fringes of the side are desperate for a game
7772225 people like ryan valentine robin hulbert and franz burgmeier all want to start
7772226 we might use tuesdays match to give people games and to help give them some fitness too
7772227 he gives us another option in the wide areas where we need more end product
7772228 we didnt get enough crosses or shots from the wide areas on saturday so maybe franz will be able to give us a little bit more
7772229 i didnt see him until saturday morning he landed at newcastle at 7pm on friday after hed had a long old trip from albania where hed been playing for his country
7772230 he travelled throughout thursday and friday to get himself back here which is something that premier league clubs normally have to deal with
7772231 i played against tony mowbray many times he is a great pro
7772232 he had a terrific playing career and he is having a great career as a manager it will be tough test and he wont come up here expecting an easy game
7772233 tony will be too respectful and professional for that he will put out a good team but ive said many times weve got nothing to lose and west brom have got everything to lose
7772234 i hope we win and im expecting to win here at our own ground
7772235 there is no reason why we cant i dont know whether they will rest main players or bring big players in but whatever they do it should inspire us
7772236 i expect to win im not expecting to just lay down and have our bellies tickled we want to have a real go at them and lets see what happens
7772237 it can make a big impact on the rest of the season if we can get some confidence
7772238 it will be a totally contrasting game to saturday and rightly so because they want to come here and win the game
7772239 unfortunately on saturday against stockport it wasnt two teams that wanted to tango and the one that didnt tango won likely line ups hartlepool lee barrett sweeney nelson collins humphreys jones power liddle monkhouse porter brown

7772255 but you are a lawyer you are a practicing lawyer even during the marcos era the tro is known to attorney santos when he is not a member of the court of appeals did you not inquire from attorney santos how he came to know about the tro
7772256 you said you are not lobbying but you are trying to influence your brother
7772257 rely upon the merits of his cause and refrain from any impropriety which tends to influence or gives the appearance of influencing the court
7772258 it seems you are making these things an exception to many things you called your brother for this case even if you are bordering into something that is unethical and downright illegal you did not even think you are obstructing justice
7772259 my brother do not hesitate calling me because he was five years older then me we respect him he helped me find a career in the judiciary i owe him a debt of gratitude
7772260 because of my respect for him and his respect for me he never insisted i dont know why he is being faulted now
7772261 are you saying it is alright for a brother to call you up in connection with a case pending before the court of appeals as long as you will decide accordingly is that what you are saying
7772262 is that not dangerous relying on filipino culture in situations like this
7772263 i will be a hypocrite if i will not say what i said he is my brother if there will be consequences then so be it

7772326 damage control and financial minimization at a time like this has not even been considered

7772328 grocery stores generally have two brands of meat on their shelves and maple leaf owns both of those brands
7772329 you may find a local offering but primarily its maple leaf products from coast to coast
7772330 when these things happen people turn off of the category for a little bit of time until they feel its safe to eat again

7772334 investors have lumped all financials both good and poor performers together under the same category and have generally stayed away
7772335 during this time its important to remember that each financial company is different and should be evaluated individually on its own merits
7772336 solid core financials entering times of market or economic crisis often emerge stronger in the end obtaining increased market share from weaker performers who fall by the wayside

7772384 with the economic situation worsening and the property market still suffering we are calling on the government to take urgent action on hips
7772385 we have long seen hips as not fit for purpose and as the wrong answer to simplifying the house buying process quite simply the government tried to force square pegs into round holes and the slower property market is making this situation worse for instance the current call for local searches to be conducted as part of a hip is madness due to the length of time properties are on the market in the current climate a majority of searches are out of date by the time the property is sold which means they have to be repeated at extra cost to the consumer

7772393 as significant investors in the broader brazilian market they have raised their concerns because of the damaging effect they anticipate this action could have on both the value of their other brazilian holdings and on confidence in the brazilian market as a whole

7772431 weve been preparing for utah state the entire offseason ive always said that its kind of like the olympics you get a lot of time to prepare for that first opponent and we wanted to take advantage of that time and prepare the right way
7772432 but i was excited about the chance to become a head coach ive been preparing for that opportunity my entire life and i was excited to be a head coach when i got the chance i would do the same thing all over again
7772433 i remember how after winning that first game each game got more and more intense after that
7772434 as the winning kept going the overall atmosphere in the locker room kept getting higher and higher the whole week was spent focusing on that game that week there was a lot of leadership
7772435 he can be a goofy guy but the way he carried himself in the locker room and the way brian does now taught me a lot about what we need for this season

7772467 although the major mechanism of bluetongue virus spread is undoubtedly that of culicoides midges feeding on infected ruminants growing the virus and then transmitting it to further susceptible animals other mechanisms may also be at work these may assume greater importance during the midge free season winter such as we in northern latitudes experience
7772468 experiments have revealed a toolbox of possible mechanisms with the potential to interact with and complement one another
7772469 we decided to bring him in here and see where hes at wed like to have a kicker opening day and hes our kicker we dont want to have every other week a kicking contest again
7772470 we need a guy thats going to be consistent when youre inside the 30 yard line some guys are comfortable there some guys you have to get closer youve got to have a consistent kicker especially when youre putting a new offense in all points are important
7772471 we hope whoever those two guys are well get in position to kick some field goals

7772473 its the reality of the business i wasnt surprised for a guy like that to be on the street i wasnt surprised they brought him in whether its now or later in the season
7772474 we deserve to be the kickers for the kansas city chiefs this experience will make us better its just another test for us

7772490 concerns about credit risks both in the united states and japan are still strong there are also worries about the global economic outlook
7772491 the fixed income markets are signaling to central banks the need to prepare for protracted sub trend growth

7772498 i recognize that some who do dna barcoding may be upset by this study but that is the nature of science

7772502 there are a number of people who are feeling a sense of loss
7772503 i think that the level of animosity is far less this year than there was in 1984
7772504 the animosity there did not end with the convention and it continued on through the general election
7772505 that was a long primary contest too this one there is far less rancor

7772508 islam wishes to destroy all states and governments anywhere on the face of the earth which are opposed to the ideology and program of islam regardless of the country or the nation which rules it the purpose of islam is to set up a state on the basis of its own ideology and program regardless of which nation assumes the role of the standard bearer of islam or the rule of which nation is undermined in the process of the establishment of an ideological islamic state islam does not intend to confine this revolution to a single state or a few countries the aim of islam is to bring about a universal revolution

7772513 working people in silicon valley are walking an economic tightrope and any unexpected medical bill or even a car breakdown can push them over the edge
7772514 this report does an excellent job documenting what people outside the region have been slow to understand that silicon valley is a fairly brutal environment
7772515 our performance on the global stage doesnt necessarily translate into regional prosperity the kind that is widely shared so you get this troubling picture where our companies are thriving but the region feels worse off

7772535 its no more important than the four games we have in chicago after every game is the playoffs right now
7772536 you draw it up and the law of averages says youre going to score some runs but you cant depend on that
7772537 youre here to learn and focus on education youre going to have to confirm to a standardized code of dress in the real world so we might as well start now they can dress like they want to on the weekend or after school
7772538 i cannot find shirts for girls with three buttons and no logos
7772539 i dont blame the school i blame her mom for letting her walk out like that
7772540 im going to be totally hot if i have to come up to school and get my girls out of school for a button
7772541 it doesnt matter if you come from a million dollar home or a 50 000 home

7772545 i dont know how you can look at your kids and do this when the next police officer is gunned down or killed is it fair to blame you because i am going to give you partial blame
7772546 to do the kind of attack that this bruce jacobs did on the widow of a murdered officer that gave his life for this community less than year ago is reprehensible
7772547 bruce jacobs you coldheartedly attacked a heros wife and family and attempted to disgrace his memory
7772548 i was asked to speak on the human costs of illegal immigration and i think im qualified to speak on that
7772549 for him to go on the attack like that without knowing why i went to d c or knowing what i was saying was pretty reprehensible
7772550 the fourth defensive tackle is a guy by the name of klecko
7772551 he looks good to me right now he had a good game the other night and hes had a great camp
7772552 ive been hearing that hes a long shot since ive been in the nfl
7772553 they said i was too small to be a nose tackle up in new england
7772554 i just put it out of my mind and go play
7772555 he has good football sense and he loves to play hes a high motor guy im not going to say he hasnt surprised me some im not quite as surprised after being around him a bit
7772556 honestly if you guys had not just told me id have no idea what was said
7772557 ive got to get through this week and then hopefully when the roster for st louis the season opener comes youre name is still there im just going to keep doing what i did to get here keep pushing
7772558 to tell truth id only lost about 10 pounds to go down to fullback
7772559 putting the weight back on wasnt the problem it was eating all that chicken and salad to get it off in the first place
7772560 switching back to tackle was easy you just go back to what you know the only thing was you had to get back in that pass rushing and run stuffing mind set it wasnt a big deal
7772561 i had to learn the whole front seven in new england
7772562 it was just as complicated up there dont get me wrong because im still learning but i think its going ok

7772568 last year the mets had a big lead and i think they kind of thought they were a much better team than us
7772569 this year all the games have been close even though theyre 9 4 against us its been close we know were definitely capable of beating them
7772570 we only got to enjoy being in first place for one day
7772571 then it was three and out that kind of sticks with you
7772572 even if we feel we can beat them weve got to play them good weve got to play them better than they do these are big games for us big opportunities
7772573 we felt that there should have been more inquiries into whatever biases and prejudices the grand jurors had before they heard the case
7772574 we wanted a fair and unbiased grand jury we wanted it returned so we could obtain one and the judge disagreed
7772575 it goes without saying that in many critical ways the grand jury is not like a trial jury and lacks numerous features that would safeguard the rights of a defendant
7772576 clearly addressed the possibility of prior knowledge of the case
7772577 the manner of his doing so did not deprive the defendant of a substantial procedural right

7772586 the lack of progress was again explained to a large extent by the lack of progress in cutting weight in 2007 cars again became 10 kg heavier heavier cars use more fuel
7772587 with the threat of legislation looming bmw has shown that even premium carmakers can seriously reduce co2
7772588 but the slow response of most carmakers shows that the eu needs to keep up the pressure with challenging long term co2 targets
7772589 it is striking that three of the bottom four carmakers are japanese suzuki mazda and nissan
7772590 all three did not close the gap sufficiently in 2007 and will have to speed up their efforts
7772591 asked the prosecutor general to hold a detailed investigation to clarify the matter

7772600 its very hard not to think about the olympic games
7772601 very difficult to refocus i mean all my thinking is there in beijing
7772602 in russia if you stop anyone in the street and ask what is a grand slam i dont think many people can tell you but everyone knows the olympic games there is nothing bigger
7772603 people just come to me and say oh im happy for you
7772604 that may not seem impressive compared to package titles that sell in the millions but compared to other digital titles that is a friggin juggernaut
7772605 consumers voted with their dollars they basically have sent the message loud and clear we are tired of meta emulated crap we want the titles of yesteryear to be paid the proper respect we want them done right and if the price is right well buy

7772609 shane on first 10 foot lead posada knows shane hook slides so hes gonna throw to the inside part of the base
7772610 shane goes posada throws umpire calls him out bang here come 12 different replays and they all show shanes hook slide avoided the tag they dont reverse the call yankees win the game
7772611 they say it will slow down the games it takes 2 seconds to re rack the tape you know what slows down games lou piniella going out there to argue for 4 minutes kicking dirt
7772612 and van brocklin would throw it and mcdonald wasnt there and van brocklin would get really hissed
7772613 mcdonald had tripped i could see that on my monitors in the truck but the fan watching at home didnt know that i wanted the fan to see what i saw
7772614 took it back to new york somebody erased it or taped over it which is what happened to the first super bowl which i directed
7772615 no royalties because i was an employee at cbs and no emmy i dont know why maybe it was an anti italian backlash
7772616 called the truck and said my boy what you have done here will have such far reaching implications we cant begin to imagine them today
7772617 he had to do everything had to shoot the biggest water buffalo but he couldnt have invented instant replay because he was never in the truck he never directed he never punched the buttons
7772618 tony verna son of italian immigrants invented the instant replay
7772619 because it changed something that had never been done before
7772620 peace is one of the hallmarks of our way of life to have detonations trucks and dust what is that going to do

7772626 as soon as it hit that its spent most of the time falling
7772627 in terms of falling this far this quickly it would easily be in the top three fastest falls no doubt about that
7772628 its been one hell of a fall for the aussie
7772629 we think the market is going to be surprised about the resilience of the australian economy so we think that the aussie will find some support
7772630 the bark obama t shirts have been selling really well and the george w bush biscuits have been a big hit
7772631 if our sales figures were votes then obama would win by a landslide
7772632 every day we rearrange the displays where customers have picked stuff up but we never have to touch the mccain section because no one goes near it

7772637 the 2008 budget corrected most of the accounting distortions introduced by the howard government but it still failed to bring the earnings of the future fund to account
7772638 it seems curious that the labor government has corrected the budget figures by including the 47 billion gst but ignored the smaller 3 5 billion earnings of the future fund
7772639 its about time governments used the true figure rather than making adjustments for political purposes
7772640 there has not been any local data just a bit of continuation from the us

7772665 i think the direction of the club is always paramount
7772666 the club is bigger than any individual but having said that it was a very tough decision for the club to move forward we needed to make that decision
7772667 if i take my playing cap off and look at it from an outside perspective we all want the club to succeed and move forward to playing finals footy and i totally understand my delisting
7772668 but from a personal point of view i still feel like ive got some time left
7772669 im not hanging my hat on getting a spot at an afl club next year but im definitely putting my hand up to say look my mind feels good my body feels good i want to continue playing
7772670 jimmy stynes came to me to say that you need two more games for life membership
7772671 to play last week and obviously to get up this week to be a life member of the afl is something i can really be proud of
7772672 he could do the absolute spectacular thing when you least expected him to do it hed do something not so many players in the afl can do that often
7772673 but i cant say ill sit there and think about it during the game i want to win
7772674 ive played in that stadium for the last 14 years so its a pretty special cathedral in baseball and hopefully im around next year to see the new one
7772675 were fine bro we go though this garbage every year at the end of the day well take another ring with us
7772676 we spent a lot of years playing there where we had big brother little brother
7772677 my first two or three years they were the big brother we were the little brother and they just pounded on us so we grew up a little bit
7772678 obviously we have one memory that stands out it goes beyond that though ive been a part of pitchers duels getting blown out blowing them out and its always been kind of an exciting time i think with baseball in general any time you incite fan involvement that wont go away
7772679 knowing the history of the game and knowing the people that have played this game before me have been on the same field is quite an amazing feeling
7772680 its the honor of playing on the same dirt same grass same area that those guys occupied
7772681 i dont think we necessarily need to sweep them but we need to win the series
7772682 were actually pretty excited about it this series is going to tell us where we are
7772683 if we dont play well it sets us back we know the urgency of playing well in that series and winning games if we need a time to catch up tuesday is the time for us
7772684 we have a veteran team and weve been counted out so many times this year
7772685 weve got nothing to lose we just have to go out there and play the game a lot of people arent expecting us to do anything except for the guys in this clubhouse
7772686 you really want to have a good night and find a way to help the team
7772687 im looking forward to it im sure the fans are going to be into it and thats all you can ask for thats why you play the game is for series like this and down the home stretch its what you put all the work in for
7772688 any time youre early in the game you want to put up runs to take their crowd out of it
7772689 in that ballpark its going to go down to the ninth inning it always does because its such a small park
7772690 hes going to be the second hitter in the lineup and well watch him play watch him perform see at what level the team is playing at with him performing and see where we are
7772691 hopefully he gives us that 295 great on base percentage and plays a good second base and can pick us up a little bit
7772692 for me its about wins and losses and evaluating wins and losses
7772693 we dont have much time to get personal youre watching the team and how the team is performing
7772694 i hate to say i see things more like a coach now but i think thats the experienced part of me speaking
7772695 as a player a lot of times you just think of yourself i realize the most important thing is the team although i want to play
7772696 im going to see what it looks like in practice and then evaluate it
7772697 the system i have had in my head for the last 16 years wont just be washed away i felt a lot more comfortable the other night although we made a lot more mistakes which falls back on me i am not going to say its getting easier but its definitely more easily correctable
7772698 they come in a lot of different ways you get rolled up in a pile you know the turf does it you do it in practice but ive played so many games and not that i havent been injured but ive overcome injuries
7772699 hey i mean this is 18 years whatever is going to happen is going to happen
7772700 i respect mike a lot he helped me a lot and i am not opposed to mike coming back in some capacity
7772701 the move was always to get the best most quality people on the field
7772702 this is something i have been preparing for my entire life basically
7772703 hopefully he can just come back and not miss a beat
7772704 kiwi is the guy every year that regardless of what position we put him at hes going to produce and play to his ability
7772705 its just about getting comfortable he was working in a two point stance being up now hes got to put his hand back in the dirt i think in a week or two as time goes by and he gets comfortable gets used to it gets the rhythm back of playing defensive end hell be fine
7772706 im very comfortable with our young prospects coming here and doing it the way argenis reyes has done it the way daniel murphy has done it the way nick evans has done it i feel comfortable internally that well find a way to get it done
7772707 with where we are being in a pennant race you probably just have to go with your best we dont have in my opinion the luxury or the wiggle room we are in the fight of our lives
7772708 sinds 2004 zijn er maatregelen genomen om de statistieken te verbeteren zo is de definitie van een werkloze veranderd en worden heel wat categorie n mensen niet meer in de cijfers opgenomen er zijn ook meer uitsluitingen

7772719 its been one hell of a fall for the aussie
7772720 investors are taking risk off the table said jonathan cavenagh currency strategist at westpac
7772721 stocks are lower and in an environment of risk aversion the aussie is likely to head lower
7772722 as soon as it hit that its spent most of the time falling mr capurso said
7772723 in terms of falling this far this quickly it would easily be in the top three fastest falls no doubt about that
7772724 its been one hell of a fall for the aussie
7772725 we think the market is going to be surprised about the resilience of the australian economy so we think that the aussie will find some support mr capurso said
7772726 i am aware he was writing a lot of articles in that magazine and was part of the publishing team
7772727 i want an early election but this must follow the necessary reform of our electoral system
7772728 i have said publicly in the past that if there is no peoples charter there would be no elections
7772729 they have climbed rooftops to tell me gratuitously that we must follow the constitution on the way forward i understand that
7772730 i believe that there is an emerging consensus for example on aspects of electoral reforms
7772731 how would you like to sit in the front row
7772732 he doesnt own the view besides were trying to beat it into childrens heads that the environment is an important issue they spend all day planting trees and they come back and the trees are gone so what do you tell the kids
7772733 its just a shame that a small group of people want to put me out of business
7772734 theyre not very nice people if people are going to start harassing me ill get my lawyers involved
7772735 i got passed around until i met some folks who could help me i dont remember who they were i just wanted a view
7772736 the view serves a business function and its part of the reason he purchased that spot
7772737 but i guarantee you that hell be held accountable not by the county but by the long green valley association
7772738 concerned about the kind of message being sent to the young people who planted the trees
7772739 if i was a giant id do whatever i could to get him out and have him back on my team
7772740 the guy still looks great hes a hell of a player i would have done whatever to try to get him back initially but now how could you not want him back
7772741 they want to see if there is any interest there
7772742 he is probably on a beach somewhere sipping on some pina coladas so i doubt football is the first thing on his mind
7772743 he said he missed it but at the same time he said hes content and excited to go into the next phase of his life so i dont really look too strongly to that possibility
7772744 fortunately we have players including kiwi who are capable of picking up that kind of slack
7772745 as always well continue to research all of our options
7772746 obviously that will be the first thing everybody wants to ask what do you think mike is going to do
7772747 no one knows no one knew last year so obviously i am not going to know now well just wait and see what happens
7772748 i got six rbis a couple of home runs i think its the right time
7772749 i think i learned my lesson instead of talking about it for three weeks we come out appreciate it i guess its water under the bridge huh
7772750 i was like ok im going to keep using that
7772751 im thinking if i can cut off the run at home plate and try to preserve that shutout
7772752 it just didnt work out it was a good performance by pelfrey a great performance by pelfrey
7772753 if thats the case then so be it i can get some practice in today and tomorrow well be ok
7772754 i dont know if three plays or six plays although i would like to do that i dont know what you get out of that really
7772755 its an ongoing debate how do you treat that fourth preseason game
7772756 some of this game its really about individuals and its about the back end of the roster and its about those tough decisions that you have to make on players 45 through 53 or seeing how guys who get more play time in the base scheme how they respond in this game often you can resurrect some people and can whatever the opposite of resurrect is
7772757 i drove holmgren crazy but i was much younger i didnt really understand how things worked
7772758 i see things more like a coach now but i think thats the experience part of it speaking i do understand his manginis side of it i really do he has the whole team to think of
7772759 well i guess no more of a concern than coming in late and having a week to prepare for my first game like i did two weeks ago
7772760 to me that was a real game based on the circumstances at least in this case i will have some practice and have worked with these guys not that that makes it any better but i feel more comfortable in the situation now than i did several weeks ago
7772761 i decided to pull the old car out of the garage and see how i felt
7772762 i forgot how tough it is to run routes when youre a little bit winded in the two minute drill
7772763 first of all a big guy like him you try to get to that area but im not concerned about it
7772764 i think sometimes we get too caught up in the pitch counts if you go out there and take the ball and throw complete games its huge for us
7772765 when you do that lift pelfrey due to the innings count you start to contain talent you cant contain talent at some point hes got to cross that barrier
7772766 im just going to do whatever they tell me im going to take the ball whenever they tell me
7772767 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7772768 an open time limit is not acceptable in any security deal that governs the presence of the international forces
7772769 go through a number of levers in the iraqi political system before we actually have an agreement from the iraqi side
7772770 the arrest is part of an ongoing investigation by lancashire constabulary and greater manchester counter terrorism unit
7772771 thats the misconception i really havent been feeling that bad
7772772 i get phone calls from people back home who are reading the papers and whatever and saying are you doing ok
7772773 theres been some situations that have come up that have simply been out of my control and really i think im doing a pretty good job of not worrying about that stuff
7772774 it felt good to go out there and complete some passes and get that good drive 72 yards to start the third quarter but i havent been feeling that bad
7772775 a magnitude 6 or so about once a year so this is not unusual
7772776 each time i play a grand slam i always think that oh this could be my last time playing here
7772777 ive obviously learned that i have no idea what the future kind of holds and what will happen and i dont make decisions for the future any more from this day that im living in
7772778 but im so excited to be back here i didnt think i would be back playing you never know how many more chances youll get to be playing here
7772779 there are still a lot of families that have experienced a lot of damage some of which is not covered by insurance we have a state disaster relief fund that is in desperate need of donations from folks that are willing to give

7772781 were very aware that communities have spent considerable dollars in the recovery phase after the tornado and the floods and were very aware that many of them have budgets that are strained which is why were going to expedite the reimbursement process

7772809 last year this was a financial crisis that we thought with a bit of luck would be over by the time of christmas but it has dragged on for a year and looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7772810 its fair to say that if you look at the shocks impinging on us this is at least as challenging a time as back in the 1970s
7772811 some people have said its as big a financial shock as the great depression and as far as the oil shock goes the rise in oil prices is in the same order of magnitude that we had to deal in the 1970s

7772819 moreover dilip has been instrumental in giving lot of youngsters their due most of these youngsters have done remarkably well and a case in point is india s triumph in the world twenty20 championships in south africa where young unheard of cricketers became superstars overnight so i strongly feel that he should continue for one more year

7772966 there is a famous story from seoul in 1988 that there were so many used condoms on the roof terrace of the british teams residential block the night after the swimming concluded that the british olympic association sent out an edict banning
7772967 but and this is the thing success does not work both ways gold medal winning female athletes are not looked upon by male athletes with any more desire than those who flunked out in the first round it is sometimes even considered a defect as if there is something downright unfeminine about all that striving fist pumping and incontinent sweating sport in this respect is a reflection of wider society where male success is a universal desirable whereas female success is sexually ambiguous i do not condone this phenomenon merely note it not all athletes are finely tuned specimens of perfect physical health of course a fair number are smokers not prepared to give up despite the nagging of coaches and physiologists
7772968 i also think it is significant that for most athletes the village is thousands of miles from home the old what goes on tour stays on tour mantra is still alive and kicking not just in sport but beyond there is something deepseated in humanity that leads us to play by different rules whenever we leave town a phenomenon that has caused instances of terrible inhumanity when it comes to sex it simply means that those in relationships no longer recognise or at least ignore the boundaries of fidelity and honesty that underpin human monogamy philosophers call it moral relativism the rest of us call it hypocrisy
7772969 i suggest that it is the coming together if you will forgive the expression of these factors that creates such an explosive sexual cocktail within the security controlled perimeter of the olympic village

7773435 rapid identification of pathogenic agents in biological samples using pulsed laser optoacoustic spectroscopy with targeted nanoparticle contrast agents
7773436 this research is intended to develop a rugged battlefield instrument capable of detecting chemical and biological agents such as anthrax plague smallpox and others with the speed accuracy sensitivity and reliability of analytical techniques and instruments found in the state of the art laboratory today
7773437 elongated gold nanoparticles designed to strongly absorb near infrared laser pulses can be conjugated to each type of mab to create a specificity mechanism that will signal the presence of targeted pathogens
7773438 when the nanoparticles produce an acoustic response to laser pulses the presence and concentration of the pathogens is established
7773439 this is an important continuation of fairways current government and industry sponsored research when the r amp d part of this project is over fairway will manufacture the devices for the navy and other dod customers
7773440 early front line detection of biological threats using this kind of rugged battlefield system will provide critical information that can save navy sailors and lives of other us military personnel as well as support fast well informed command decision making

7773483 right now we are looking forward to the bangladeshis in darwin and our chance will come over the next 15 months to play against the poms back in england
7773484 it actually doesnt bother me at all right now we are looking forward thats history
7773485 i think we need to look right now at playing bangladesh in darwin and as far as i am going to look is india the test series coming up
7773486 i think we would be silly to look any further
7773487 i think it is an opportunity for guys in the one day team to push for selection whether it be the test matches in india or the australian summer
7773488 we have so much cricket coming up and unfortunately there are only 11 spots theyve picked 14 to go to darwin so there are a few guys pushing very hard for selection there
7773489 anytime hes ready to come back we are well and truly waiting for him
7773490 obviously hes pretty busy at the moment got a few things on his plate he knows everybody is supporting him we have all sent him a message wishing him well
7773491 we will soon contact the boards of these nations and confirm a series with them
7773492 we dont want to take any gloss away from what is our most important home assignment against india by playing against them so close to the series
7773493 sri lanka is also an option but weve already played against them earlier this year
7773494 weve had a strong view all along that our players shouldnt be going to pakistan at this point in time so to get this decision is a good one for us
7773495 it was obviously due to a circumstance within that country which was certainly out of the control of the local cricket board and i think the whole of the icc really feels for pakistan cricket at the moment
7773496 the security situation in pakistan has deteriorated during the year and postponement was the right decision
7773497 we were concerned about the situation in pakistan and felt that if we continued to work through the process put in place by the icc that the right decision would be reached
7773498 by postponing the tournament until october next year there is time for the security situation in pakistan to improve or for a suitable alternative venue to be chosen
7773499 we appreciate the difficulties that this decision will cause the pakistan cricket board and hope that the champions trophy can be held there in 2009

7773569 i think layering is a huge trend that you should use and take advantage when youre working in an office environment
7773570 you just kind of have to gauge what your office temperature is as opposed to what it is outside
7773571 if you are in your office all day then you are going to dress a specific way if you are a person on the go then you have to dress accordingly i think this season there is a lot of flexibility in the way you can dress for the warmer months
7773572 you can easily throw them on over your dress and when you leave work take the cardigan off and youre still dressed appropriately for the climate
7773573 linen is great wide leg linen pants are a big trend this season they will keep you cool when youre outside but at least you have that coverage when youre inside
7773574 i pulled her up and her eyes were wide open
7773575 i thought she was catching a seizure but she wasnt breathing
7773576 had he not been there i dont know what wouldve happened
7773577 i didnt think id ever use it especially not at my house
7773578 but i had to think fast it was either now or never
7773579 we tell them horror stories and we always hope they do the right thing
7773580 we dont just want students to be engaged during the 50 minutes of class
7773581 its important to have them fully engaged in and out of class the union should be the hub for that
7773582 students want access to certain things wireless internet a place to study late and eat something and our student union should be able to provide that
7773583 if they had that on campus theyd connect more outside of the classroom
7773584 the student union should be the living room of the campus
7773585 ul allowed me to stay close to my family and i can still live at home
7773586 students today are just more unwilling to share a bathroom with other people down the hall when they grew up with their own bathroom
7773587 theyre used to a certain lifestyle and theyre not eager to give that up
7773588 but you have extended cable high speed internet your electricity is paid for you meet a lot of new people and the benefits go on and on
7773589 we dont want to turn the lights out at 5 p m
7773590 we want students to make campus a part of the rest their day as well
7773591 today waking up felt like the day of the national championship game
7773592 it was raining outside but i still had a smile on my face i even rolled down the windows and smiled so everyone could see my pearly whites
7773593 this is just a great day ive been looking forward to it for a long time we start fresh
7773594 thats going to feel like the national championship game too
7773595 its going to be something to remember just running out there on the field for the first time with the defense its something im always going to remember this is a special week
7773596 its always funs to look forward to kicking off a new season the expectations of 08 as we all know are pretty high i think at this point in time were all looking forward to playing an opponent certainly itll be great to be back in tiger stadium in front of our fans we look forward to the match up i think our offense certainly is prepared and looking forward to start fast
7773597 our quarterbacks i have great confidence in all three of them to be honest with you
7773598 i cant tell you today who will take the field first i can tell you that ill be comfortable with whoever that is well kind of see how it plays out from here
7773599 theres nothing but health there and so from this point forward well kind of make those decisions as we go i would not be surprised if all three played at certain times
7773600 starting would definitely be awesome but thats up to the coaches
7773601 and well see how it all plays out im just preparing
7773602 virtually everybody that showed up for camp should be ready to play with possibly one exception alexander
7773603 charles alexander has the green light for today so well see how that goes but were really optimistic that hell be ready to play
7773604 thats probably the richest resource you have for finding a doctor who will communicate well with people
7773605 the bottom line issue is the level of rapport or the level of confidence that i have with my doctor
7773606 thats a great starting point for any doctor patient relationship
7773607 of course anyones allowed in you just have to be dressed a certain way and ready to pay the 400 deposit on entry

7773611 bryn has asked me to be involved for a few years but because of filming ive never been able to
7773612 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show
7773613 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7773614 we have provided daleks and components for the tardis in the past and i think a one off move to the screen would be amazing
7773615 it would take dr who to the next level so should be very successful
7773616 i think david tenant is an excellent doctor who is perfect for the part because he is eccentric and a nice guy too
7773617 it really shook him up he and i both essentially went through high school and college fantasizing about christina applegate so at first he was really excited like dude i totally get to see christina applegate nude but i guess the trauma of realizing that he drove a dagger into the collective heart of men everywhere by cutting off the very things that helped him through the rough spots of puberty was just too much for him
7773618 it started out kind of funny actually she was lying there on the table unconscious he was joking around check it out im finally getting to touch kelly bundys boobs but then you could almost see a kind of black cloud of realization drift over him as i handed him the scalpel and he remembered the task at hand when it was all said and done he just stood there for awhile then screamed what have i done and ran out of the room crying
7773619 ramblin thoughts of a van drivin schmo as the team gets ready to rumble
7773620 burden the original decision of the woman and the physician
7773621 would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an anti abortion statute
7773622 as i understand it this puts the burden on the attending physician who has determined since they were performing this procedure that in fact this is a nonviable fetus that if that fetus or child however way you want to describe it is now outside the mothers womb and the doctor continues to think that its nonviable but theres lets say movement or some indication that in fact theyre not just coming out limp and dead that in fact they would then have to call a second physician to monitor and check off and make sure that this is not a live child that could be saved
7773623 if this is a child then this would be an antiabortion statute
7773624 obama is a father of two young girls you can bet that attacks like that will get him or any father riled up that language seems to be way over the top his critics can paint him as a pro choice liberal thats fair but to go any further is really beyond the pale is obama really sinister a monster
7773625 there would be no chance for mr heim to take control of his fathers money as long as there is no hint or proof for mr heims demise there is no legal basis for german authorities to declare him dead
7773626 i do not see any way the kids can inherit the bank account of their father
7773627 as long as we dont know he is dead we have to assume hes still alive
7773628 we are staying tuned to his case as we are talking about very cruel crimes
7773629 following my suspension by the general medical council i have been informed that the greater glasgow and clyde health board has taken legal advice and may cancel my contract to provide medical services this means i will no longer be able to work as a general practitioner at all in future my staff will also lose their jobs
7773630 necessary to send a message to the medical profession that this behaviour is unacceptable
7773631 the panel is of the opinion that you allowed your views in respect of physician assisted suicide to influence your treatment of patient a you made a serious misjudgment and embarked upon a potentially criminal act
7773632 they indicated that they were considering terminating my contract and since then ive been told that they are looking at it quite seriously
7773633 obviously i dont want that to happen im 62 now and dont think i could cope with starting up a new practice i understand there will be another meeting next week but have been told not to expect good news
7773634 the panel is of the opinion that you allowed your views in respect of physician assisted suicide to influence your treatment of patient a
7773635 that the panel allowed their personal views in respect of physician assisted suicide to influence their treatment of dr kerr they made a serious misjudgement and embarked upon a potentially immoral act
7773636 the panel is of the opinion that you allowed your views in respect of physician assisted suicide to influence your treatment of patient a you made a serious misjudgment and embarked upon a potentially criminal act

7773667 even significantly lower crude oil prices did nothing to brighten the consumer mood
7773668 we continue to have the same goal which is to reach agreement by the end of the year

7773953 barack obamas father was muslim and therefore according to islamic law so is the candidate in spite of the koranic verses explaining that there is no compulsion in religion a muslim child takes the religion of his or her father for muslims around the world non american muslims at any rate they can only ever see barack hussein obama as a muslim
7773954 obama may not want to be counted as a muslim but muslims are eager to count him as one of their own
7773955 he has to be good for arabs because he is a muslim

7774243 its horrific what ice is doing to these families and these communities
7774244 its just hard to imagine that this is the united states of america
7774245 people are afraid we need to calm them there are mothers and children involved

7774247 howard industries runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for jobs
7774248 it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
7774249 its a real contradiction between our proclaimed values of hard work and family in mississippi and the actions of local law enforcement and ice i think its a real affront to our values theyre creating their own terrorism by going after workers
7774250 this has been a competition from the first day we got here really none of us here knew chad pennington bill parcells knew him but that was a while ago
7774251 so we needed to see him and see what he can do and see how the team responded to him as well
7774252 i like what weve seen and i think the guy will do a great job out there managing the game
7774253 hes moved our team down the field on offense and the team has responded really well to him so thats where were going
7774254 his demeanor with the players at halftime and the way they responded to him that really made my decision
7774255 if thats the case then so be it i can get some practice in today and tomorrow well be ok
7774256 i dont know if three plays or six plays although i would like to do that i dont know what you get out of that really
7774257 its an ongoing debate how do you treat that fourth game
7774258 some of this game its really about individuals and its about the back end of the roster and its about those tough decisions that you have to make on players 45 through 53 or seeing how guys who get more play time in the base scheme how they respond in this game often you can resurrect some people and can whatever the opposite of resurrect is
7774259 i drove holmgren crazy but i was much younger i didnt really understand how things worked
7774260 i see things more like a coach now but i think thats the experience part of it speaking i do understand his side of it i really do he has the whole team to think of
7774261 well i guess no more of a concern than coming in late and having a week to prepare for my first game like i did two weeks ago
7774262 to me that was a real game based on the circumstances at least in this case i will have some practice and have worked with these guys not that that makes it any better but i feel more comfortable in the situation now than i did several weeks ago
7774263 but i mean were going to find ways to get better even if we lose
7774264 if we lose im not the only one to lose its me and my teammates i just know that if im feeling bad the whole team is feeling bad weve just got to do our best to keep each other up if that was to happen
7774265 we have had a 1000 per cent increase i am so upset and stressed out about it
7774266 we registered our objection online and checked twice that it went through but have had no response whatsoever
7774267 i also filled in the objection form for my home to the best of my ability i was told i had provided insufficient information so it had been rejected several other homeowners told me the same had happened to them
7774268 i will pay my rates at a 15 increase and write a letter to the municipality and attach eastons letter
7774269 i cannot afford an increase of r2500 a month in rates this is squeezing the life out of knysna out of the people who are making the town run
7774270 you cant dump a 1000 increase on people i will have to retrench at least two people
7774271 its crazy we have a problem because we dont have the cash flow to pay the rate increases
7774272 the site valuation rate is up by 238 and the water and electricity have also gone up
7774273 on june 9 i hand delivered a letter from a body of industrial area business owners for which i received a written receipt addressed to grant easton and the municipal manager johnny douglas asking them to contact me i have had no response at all
7774274 i am asking for a meeting because i dont have the monthly cash flow to pay for this at all there is a downturn in the economy and we are battling
7774275 easton said he was aware that there were problems and that he would look into it he asked us to write a letter detailing our problems which we did
7774276 i am complaining about the cent in the rand factor that was used to determine the rates
7774277 rentals will increase guys are also laying off staff in order to keep their businesses running
7774278 it was brought to the municipalitys attention right in the beginning they were informed it would affect levels of employment
7774279 using a cellphone overseas can be cripplingly expensive the roaming charges are eye watering i remember getting stung once for a three figure sum over a long weekend
7774280 an expropriation bill must be realistic and in the public interest

7774343 if a company is doing badly then you blame the managing director so it is right and fair that the coach be held responsible i know people are angry and rightfully so
7774344 i am prepared to take all that responsibility for the good of the team i still back the players do they suddenly become bad players or is there something else wrong
7774345 we should have won the opportunities were there but we just let them slip im not going to panic because having watched the video again i saw how great we played
7774346 its just that final thing we are missing either a pass not going to hand or someone having the wrong body position and losing the ball in contact or not working hard enough in support

7774372 i have 29 locations around the city as feeding sites and many of those are near restaurants filling stations or protein processing plants in the industrial area where food has been found in the past
7774373 obviously the best answer to the huge population of cats in the city would be a comprehensive neutering programme but no one has the time or skill to catch them and the spca doesnt have the resources to process the hundreds of cats involved
7774374 usually i lay out the food and leave them to help themselves but sometimes there is a downside to that tramps come around to steal the cats food for themselves
7774375 i try never to ask people for money to help the feeding programme but sometimes there are spontaneous acts of kindness
7774376 all the schools and teams that participate with their coaches will be given professional quality footballs at the end of the day to help improve their game and supplement their equipment stock
7774377 this clinic is a wonderful gesture i appeal to all local soccer clubs to affiliate with our association
7774378 this is not a political meeting just a meeting by the people about what is wrong and what is right
7774379 today we start anew in bitou you can choose your representatives and we will meet with the municipality and business once a week
7774380 we need to change things by setting up a negotiating system and we need to be given time to fix things
7774381 we dont want to fight we just want the municipality to talk to us
7774382 we are particularly interested in the interaction between wild animals and the human residents in the area as the garden route is one of the fastest expanding residential areas in the country it is an ideal location for this type of study
7774383 in addition it is thought but not proved that the cape leopard while the same species as those on the african savannas grows to be smaller probably because its diet consists of smaller prey
7774384 we look at the hairs bones and hooves found there to give us valuable information about the dietary habits of the leopards
7774385 when the robbers strike at night they spend between two and three hours with their victims before leaving with the loot
7774386 when i put it to the police the guy was drunk they said he did not appear to be drunk and there was no need to breathalyse him but you could smell alcohol from a mile and i kept on asking them to conduct a test but they refused flatly
7774387 then one of the police officers jumped into the car and whispered in the guys ear to swop places i then approached the car and he started tapping on the roof for the guy to drive away
7774388 they then drove away with the guy without taking any statements from him or the witnesses they only needed my home address and said i must not tell them how to do their job
7774389 i phoned the station commander at algoa park police station and requested clarity on this matter
7774390 he then came to their defence and said the police followed the right procedures so my case was invalid
7774391 i am sitting here without any idea of who nearly killed my daughter and there is no case against the driver there are questions to be answered because their conduct was unbecoming
7774392 but i cannot comment about what happened there because i have no details of the incident
7774393 we have recently commenced proceedings against parties involved in the production and distribution of a movie entitled hari puttar
7774394 warner bros values and protects intellectual property rights however it is our policy not to discuss publicly the details of any ongoing litigation
7774395 we registered the hari puttar title in 2005 and its unfortunate that warner has chosen to file a case so close to our films release in my opinion i dont think our title has any similarity or links with harry potter
7774396 its quite an experience being on tour with the missus in america you get full on motorcades and 15 car escorts from the police in london youre lucky if you get one rozzer police officer its something else on show night there will be 20 levels of staff before you get through to see the missus
7774397 this is my fourth tour i went to almost every single show the last time around but i hadnt seen any of this one before tonight i loved it
7774398 that never made sense to me even if george w bush was telling the truth about weapons of mass destruction in fact particularly if he was telling the truth about weapons of mass destruction why the hell would you bomb a country that could fire back that would be insane
7774399 bush did real damage to americas reputation around the world
7774400 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time

7774407 enough is enough as the police know amy is a drug addict and she has now been caught twice on film taking illegal drugs they should arrest her and put her behind bars
7774408 rehab clinics are a waste of money unless you want them to work amy doesnt want to give up drugs so shes got to learn the hard way in prison
7774409 police have to act she is making a mockery of the law it has got to stop the price amy has got to pay is losing her freedom

7774413 transnet does not own the land within those boundaries we do not own the land from blouberg strand to robben island and from robben island to the green point lighthouse and under the sea
7774414 and if we dont own the land we cannot possibly have sold it to anyone foreign or local and thats just the basic reality
7774415 this application seeks to extend the use of the property to include a small family restaurant
7774416 should this application be approved residents in the area will apply for an interdict from the high court as their constitutional right to privacy and peace will have been breached
7774417 it should be investigated who made the recommendation of the inspection and find out whether that councillor attended if not that councillor should incur the cost of fruitless expenditure
7774418 this is political i was threatened by someone after this meeting last month for objecting to this item this person told me that he would speak to the mayor regarding this issue
7774419 many people said in no uncertain terms that the restaurant was impacting on them

7774424 ryanair confirms that the fr9336 from bristol airport to barcelona girona airport on the evening of august 25 experienced an inflight depressurisation incident which caused the oxygen masks on board to deploy
7774425 as a safety precaution the captain descended and diverted the aircraft to limoges airport at approximately 11 30pm local french time
7774426 all 168 passengers disembarked safely upon landing a total of 16 passengers together with five accompanying family members have transferred at their request to a local hospital complaining of ear ache
7774427 as a precaution limoges airport have arranged a local doctor to be available to any other passengers should they require
7774428 there was a sudden drop in temperature and a rush of cold air you think to yourself god is there a hole in the aircraft it actually felt like someone had opened a door at the back of the aircraft it was incredibly cold
7774429 the next thing the oxygen masks were dropping my highest priority was to get a mask onto my son who was sitting next to me in a bemused and frightened state
7774430 we were descending for about five minutes from what i assume was 30 000 or 40 000ft to 8 000ft as we landed we saw fire engines every quarter of a mile down the runway
7774431 it was obvious to me that there was depressurisation in the cabin but there was no announcement and no evidence of the cabin crew for most of this experience why on earth didnt they give a few more calming words to the passengers
7774432 if the spdc does not comply with our demand we shall continue our struggle in every way possible first we will make demands peacefully and then we will do what we have to do
7774433 as i would not be a slave so i would not be a master this expresses my idea of democracy whatever differs from this to the extent of the difference is no democracy
7774434 the work of brotherhood members in america is a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the western civilization from within and sabotaging its miserable house by their hands and the hands of believers so that it is eliminated and gods religion is made victorious over all other religions
7774435 a subsidiary of the north american islamic trust which is supported financially by the government of saudi arabia holds title to many mosques in the u s and promotes a conservative brand of islam compatible with the ideology of the muslim brotherhood and also akin to the fundamentalist style predominant in saudi arabia

7774516 der spiegel hat eine wichtige existenzberechtigung das bild auf einem display oder einem elektronischen sucher wird mit einem sekundenbruchteil verz gerung dargestellt mit dem spiegel gibt es keine zeitverz gerung denn licht ist schneller als elektronen
7774517 nach meinem derzeitigen kenntnisstand erwarte ich daher keinen gro en wandel in der qualit t der elektronischen sucher wir werden vielleicht in unseren lebzeiten nicht mehr mit dem elektronischen sucher zufrieden sein

7774528 a san diego company that is a division of belgium based kbc bank will provide a cash advance on a house in exchange for the right to share in the homes future appreciation single property owners ages 65 to 85 can receive 10 to 15 percent of the value of their property in exchange for a 50 percent stake in the homes future value two homeowners can collect up to 30 percent of their homes value but then equitykey receives 100 percent of the propertys appreciation clients keep their existing equity and dont take on debt
7774529 equitykey cofounder jeff nash gives an example of a house worth 1 million
7774530 the company will pay the property owner between 100 000 and 150 000 in cash to partner in the growth of the property if that house grows to be worth 3 million in 20 years 1 million of the appreciation will belong to equitykey and the other 1 million to the owner if the client passes away within 10 years of signing the agreement equitykey would use a life insurance policy it purchased on the homeowner to buy the home for 2 million the company can then sell the house for 3 million should the heirs desire to keep it equitykey offers the right of first refusal to the family nash says but they essentially would have to buy the 1 million share of the house equitykey owns

7774552 dat zou ik niet durven beweren maar toegegeven wijn is al jaren een passie van me met een paar vrienden organiseerden we destijds wekelijkse proefavonden ik had daarbij het geluk dat sommige van die vrienden over gigantische wijnkelders beschikten zo leerde ik ook de grote wijnen appreci ren die ik als acteur niet zelf kon betalen in de vakantieperiodes ging ik daarenboven vaak op reis naar de franse wijngebieden ik heb er niet alleen wijnen geproefd maar ik werkte ook mee op het veld en maakte kennis met het hele productieproces en terwijl ik al die kennis assimileerde legde ik zelf een bescheiden wijnkeldertje aan
7774553 eigenlijk wel ja maar het mag natuurlijk geen opgave worden anders lukt het niet voor mij echter is bezig zijn met wijn een groot plezier mijn passie stelt me ook in staat om in het buitenland op een andere manier met mensen in contact te komen je begint te praten over wijn maar je weet niet waar je eindigt
7774554 vroeger was ik dat zeker maar sinds de dood van donald ligt dat iets moeilijker tilt zijn glas op wat niet wegneemt dat ik dit aperitief nog steeds bijzonder lekker vind aan mijn zintuigen mankeert immers niets maar het genieten op zich wordt wel beetje overschaduwd
7774555 ja maar ik blijf ademen ik word nog steeds iedere morgen wakker en ik eet en drink nog altijd even graag ik heb alleen zoveel verdomde spijt dat donald er niet meer bij kan zijn dat ik hem morgen niet kan opbellen om hem te vertellen hoe lekker ik hier vanavond wel gegeten heb dat is met alles zo telkens is er weer die behoefte om mijn ervaringen met hem te delen en te luisteren naar zijn belevenissen donald en ik hadden een heel intense band een band die op een absurde stompzinnige manier verbroken werd
7774556 ik geloof niet dat je over dat soort dingen moet praten in de vergrotende of overtreffende trap woorden als erger of ergst wil ik zelfs niet in de mond nemen stel dat ik een gebroken been heb en jij verbrandde je vingers gaan we dan onze pijn vergelijken dat gebroken been is objectief gezien de zwaardere kwetsuur maar misschien ervaar jij jouw gebroken vinger wel als het allerergste dat er is kijk het is erg voila wat mij overkwam is gruwelijk en ik wens het niemand toe
7774557 klopt spelen kan je alleen of in beperkte kring doen maar acteren doe je in de buitenwereld binnen een bepaald maatschappelijk verband de vraag is wat is dat verband dan bij de oude grieken was zowel het spelen als het acteren fantastisch het theater had immers een duidelijk functie in hun leefwereld het was de plaats waar problemen onder de aandacht werden gebracht vandaag is dat anders wat je met theater doet en waarom en met wie is ondergeschikt aan het hoe sommige producties worden tegenwoordig nog voor de eerste repetitie de grond in geboord en dat alleen maar omdat de makers niet tot het juiste clubje behoren dat geldt trouwens ook voor televisie de hypes die men cre ert zijn belangrijker geworden dan het product in die zin is acteren inderdaad een hel er zijn te veel factoren waar je geen vat op hebt acteren blijft in dit land bovendien een totaal ondergewaardeerd beroep je moet eigenlijk goed gek zijn om het hier nog te willen uitoefenen
7774558 ik was een kind van mijn tijd begin jaren 60 toen ik 14 of 15 was en moest uitmaken wat ik met mijn leven wou aanvangen besloot ik dat ik de wereld zou verbeteren het theater was voor mij het meest adequate medium om dat te doen
7774559 inderdaad een boodschap van liefde de liefde in al haar facetten was zon sterke kracht dacht ik dat we een betere wereld zouden krijgen als ze door iedereen ten volle werd beleefd een wereld zonder haat afgunst hysterie en religieuze waanzin
7774560 nee ik heb niet alleen het medium maar ook mijn bijdrage daaraan en ja ook de mens verkeerd ingeschat eigenlijk had ik me over de hele lijn vergist ik ben nu 57 en de wereld is nog geen kloten verbeterd lacht en ik die in mijn hoogmoed dacht dat ik de mensen kon veranderen
7774561 ja want ik ben en blijf een speler in wat ik daarnet zei zou je misschien een zekere bitterheid kunnen vermoeden maar ik relativeer alleen mijn vroegere hoogmoed kijk ik ben nu zon vier jaar met spoed bezig en ik besef heel goed dat wat ik in die reeks doe slechts entertainment is maar weet je wat misschien is ook dat wel een vorm van liefde ik leerde me tevreden te stellen met de wetenschap dat ik elke week zoveel honderdduizenden kijkers de gelegenheid bied om zich via dat programma even te ontspannen dat ik hen dat kan geven is een daad van liefde en af en toe is het allemaal nog zinvol ook vorige week nog ontmoette ik een jongetje dat zijn zusje had gered van een co vergiftiging dat was helemaal geen heldendaad van mij hoor zei hij ik wist wat te doen omdat ik naar spoed kijk glimlach ja dan hebben we met zijn allen potverdomme ook nog een leven gered alleen al daarom waren de voorbije vier jaar de moeite waard we moeten daar geen onzin over verkopen natuurlijk is spoed een commercieel product maar als ik s avonds bij mezelf kan zeggen die twee minuten in die ene sc ne die we vandaag draaiden dat hebben we toch goed gedaan tja dat is dan goed thuiskomen
7774562 na 32 jaar in het theater met tussendoor uitstapjes naar film en tv is dit eigenlijk de allereerste keer dat ik me gedurende langere tijd met hetzelfde personage kan bezighouden en dat wou ik ook wel eens ervaren ik beleef nog steeds heel veel plezier aan gijsbrecht gewoon omdat ik me nog iedere dag over hem verbaas ik ken hem nog altijd niet door en door
7774563 op dat vlak ben ik erg geprivilegieerd geweest ik was meer dan drie decennia lang verbonden aan een groot gezelschap de antwerpse kns waarbinnen ik me heb kunnen profileren als acteur en regisseur pas toen de kns werd opgedoekt om plaats te maken voor het toneelhuis kwam ik in een situatie terecht waarin tal van mijn collegas al jaren zaten ineens moest ik van dag tot dag gaan leven en hopen dat iemand mijn neus of ogen leuk vond want dat leer je dan al snel tal van andere factoren de milieus waarin je vertoeft je uiterlijk wegen vaak zwaarder door dan de kwaliteit die je als acteur kunt brengen komt daar nog bij dat vlaanderen tegenwoordig 2000 professionele acteurs telt terwijl er hooguit werk is voor een paar honderd
7774564 een mooie gedachte waaraan je je dan maar moet vastklampen
7774565 toen ik in de tweede helft van de jaren 70 bij de kns de kans kreeg om te gaan regisseren nam ik bewust de beslissing om geen tv meer te doen ik wou eerst het regisseursvak dat nieuw voor me was in de vingers krijgen jaren later groeide echter toch weer het verlangen om het kleine scherm dat ik zo lang verwaarloosd had opnieuw op te zoeken en dan deed zich ineens die fenomenale kans voor ik kon samen met donald in thuis stappen wat een belevenis ik had voordien al met mijn zoon op de planken gestaan en toen was ik blij dat ik hem kon laten profiteren van mijn ervaring nu deed zich het omgekeerde voor en kreeg ik ineens zoveel van hem terug donald was erg begaafd op televisiegebied
7774566 ik herinner me nog de tijd dat donald meespeelde in familie dat was in de beginjaren van de vlaamse soap van thuis was toen nog geen sprake alleen al samen met mijn zoon over straat lopen vond ik toen een verschrikking geen seconde werd hij met rust gelaten maar donald zei ach papa dat hoort er bij je wuift gewoon even je glimlacht en het is voorbij ook op dat vlak had hij zon onwaarschijnlijke naturel daar heb ik heel wat van geleerd ik blijf het er echter moeilijk mee hebben toen ik nog theater speelde vond ik het ook al een probleem om na de voorstelling het publiek te komen groeten ok het hoort erbij maar aan de andere kant als ik een prachtige tafel koop dan staat die meubelmaker daar toch ook niet naast om een buiging te maken er zijn wijken in antwerpen waar ik sinds ik voor tv werk niet kan komen zonder dat 80 van de mensen naar me wijst of goeiedag roept maar waarom vraag ik me af wat ben ik m r dan die mensen zij doen toch ook hun werk soms zou ik graag iets terugroepen maar dat kan niet want ik weet niet wat die mensen doen je zou eens moeten weten hoe vaak er naar me geglimlacht wordt op straat niet te beschrijven dan denk ik maar glimlach nu toch ns naar iedereen we zouden er een veel mooie wereld aan overhouden die glimlach doet me dus in feite een beetje pijn als ik morgen niet langer bekend ben d n zou ik graag hebben dat men naar me glimlacht gewoon omdat ik mens ben
7774567 tot hiertoe wel ja de opnameperiodes sloten de voorbije jaren altijd mooi bij elkaar aan begin dit jaar hebben we voor het eerst 2 5 maand stil gelegen de huidige opnames lopen nog tot 10 juli als er dan nog een bijbestelling voor een volgende reeks komt wat waarschijnlijk is maar nooit zeker beginnen we zeker niet voor november of december opnieuw te draaien voor het eerst in mijn leven kijk ik dus aan tegen een half jaar waarin ik niet kan werken dat is een probleem niet alleen financieel wie in ons land een hoofdrol in een serie speelt verdient immers geen fortuinen maar ook omdat het idee niets te kunnen doen me erg afschrikt sinds donald er niet meer is heb ik echt zoiets van laat me alstublieft bezig blijven zodat het hier van boven niet weer begint te malen
7774568 ik kan natuurlijk alleen maar voor mezelf spreken maar ik heb ze in ieder geval nodig
7774569 ik beschik misschien wel over een bepaalde vorm van kosmisch denken in die zin dat ik geloof in een energie die op een veel hoger plan dan het aardse functioneert stel me daar verder echter geen vragen over het is meer een gevoel dat er op het niveau van energie krachten en wetten bestaan waarin wij mensen moins que des poussi res zijn niet meer dan sterrenstof ach misschien probeer ik me daarmee wel te troosten wat voor zin heeft dit alles anders wat voor zin heeft het dat donalds kinderen zijn moeder en ik zoveel pijn hebben
7774570 alleen op het vlak van mijn werk voor de rest ben ik een heel klein jongetje dat hunkert naar genegenheid en bang is voor pijn of nee misschien moet ik zeggen dat ik dat was ik denk dat er iets veranderd is na donalds dood nu heb ik meer iets van who the fuck cares als het morgen gedaan is dan is dat maar zo
7774571 er loopt hier een jongen in zijn bloot gat over straat
7774572 ik weet niet wie hij is maar hij ziet er bang uit en hij is gewond
7774573 ik wou het verleden begraven maar deze dingen laten zich niet begraven je sleurt ze je hele verdere leven met je mee

7774589 mentaal zweef ik ergens tussen de 35 en de 40
7774590 natuurlijk voel ik me volwassen eenmaal je een zekere leeftijd hebt bereikt moet je weten wat je wilt vind ik ik krijg wat van de ally mcbeals van deze wereld vrouwen van boven de dertig die toch zo bang zijn om voor een man te kiezen word toch volwassen denk ik dan
7774591 het idee is gegroeid ten tijde van de vaginamonologen men stelde me toen vaak de vraag waarom ik in de voorstelling niets vertelde over de menopauze ik stelde vast dat veel vrouwen het daar nog steeds heel moeilijk mee hebben en ging daarmee aan de slag de nieuwe monoloog gaat echter over veel meer dan alleen maar de menopauze ik vertel ook over mijn jeugd over ouder worden en over hoe ik een meisje uit de flower power aankijk tegen de wereld van vandaag
7774592 ten eerste voel ik me allesbehalve bezadigd ten tweede zeg ik dat ook niet tegen de hele wereld ik vond het gewoon hoog tijd dat iemand weer eens tegen de schenen van het systeem ging schoppen neem nu die recente heisa rond
7774593 toch niet zelfs toen ik 18 was besefte ik al dat het kapitalisme zou overwinnen maar er werd in die tijd tenminste nog weerwerk geboden de rebellen van toen zijn intussen gerecupereerd door het systeem de macht en het kapitaal trekken altijd aan het langste eind er moet tenslotte geld worden verdiend ten koste van alles en iedereen ze hebben ook de legers om alle verzet in de kiem te smoren en als zij het niet doen doet het vaticaan het wel is dat een sombere vaststelling nee net niet het komt erop aan om te blijven schoppen tegen die schenen op de duur moeten ze dan wel naar ons luisteren weet je mijn hippieziel is nog lang niet dood ik wil de mensen nog altijd overtuigen dat een betere wereld mogelijk is en dat in letterlijk iedereen enige goedheid schuilt
7774594 er was in ons gezin inderdaad geen tijd of ruimte voor liefde er waren te veel problemen te veel kinderen en mijn vader maakte te graag ruzie gelukkig had ik mijn broers en zussen we waren met zn zevenen en hebben elkaar altijd heel veel liefde gegeven van mijn ouders kreeg ik nooit te horen dat ze van me hielden toch voel ik niet de behoefte om hen dat te verwijten ik begrijp immers ook hun eigen verhaal van iemand die alleen maar op zijn knie n kan kruipen kan je onmogelijk verlangen dat hij speciaal voor jou gaat rechtstaan mijn moeder was degene die een heel ongelukkig leven heeft gehad niet ik verbitterd ben ik dus niet er zijn trouwens mensen genoeg die het veel moeilijker hebben dan ik het ooit gehad heb
7774595 ik heb ook fouten gemaakt net zoals alle ouders maar ik heb er steeds voor gezorgd dat mijn zoon matthias w t hoeveel ik van hem hou dat geldt ook voor mijn twee gekregen zonen de kinderen van mijn man peter ik pak ze vast knuffel ze en vertel hen zo vaak mogelijk dat ik hen graag zie
7774596 uiteraard maar als je weet wat je te wachten staat ben je er al een stuk beter tegen gewapend de menopauze neemt zon twee drie jaar in beslag en valt samen met een versneld verouderingsproces daar moet je als vrouw mee leren leven het moeilijkste is natuurlijk het wegvallen van de menstruatie velen zien dat als het begin van het einde maar dat is het natuurlijk niet de menopauze is gewoon het begin van een nieuwe levensfase om eerlijk te zijn vijftig worden was ook voor mij een heel moeilijk moment eenmaal die kaap genomen ligt daar echter de volle zee het waait anders in die streken maar het is er goed vertoeven
7774597 toen hij ontdekte dat ik voor het eerst menstrueerde zei hij me als je d t hebt hoef ik geen nachtzoen van je mijn vader was echt vies van vrouwen die ongesteld waren in zijn ogen waren we onrein dat heeft me diep gekwetst
7774598 dat viel nogal mee ik heb dit boek verteld aan mijn geliefde peter die het vervolgens heeft neergeschreven hij kende de meeste van die verhalen gelukkig al ik had dit niet kunnen doen met iemand met wie ik niet zon diepe relatie had een vorm van therapie was dit boek alleszins niet ik ben iemand die blijft leven met haar verleden ik kan mijn geheugen niet wissen door mijn verhaal te vertellen ben ik dus niet genezen van enkele oude wonden dat was ook niet de bedoeling
7774599 ik heb het nochtans geprobeerd e n keer bij een psycholoog de tweede keer bij een psychiater bij die laatste heb ik het toch bijna twee jaar uitgehouden mijn huisarts had me de raad gegeven om eens met iemand te gaan praten ik zat toen midden in een echtscheiding en voelde me heel slecht in mijn vel ik bezocht die man twee keer per week maar het ging me allemaal te traag ik wou direct inzicht krijgen maar dat kan natuurlijk niet in therapie het is de bedoeling dat je alles zelf ontdekt zover reikte mijn geduld echter niet nee geef mij dan maar een goed gesprek met iemand die me kent dat helpt onmiddellijk
7774600 neen ik stoor me alleen aan de manier waarop ik daar meestal word over aangesproken men probeert me altijd in het hoekje van die vervelende harde feministes te drukken wat dat ook mogen zijn het is echter duidelijk dat het feminisme nog altijd nodig is wij vrouwen mo ten op onze strepen blijven staan want in de toekomst zal het alleen maar erger worden
7774601 kijk ik ben van mening dat vrouwen hun schoonheid moeten gebruiken ik ken mannen die in puin vallen als ze een mooie d collet zien waarom zou je dat dan niet uitbuiten snoer je niet in maar laat je zien zeg ik als verdrukte meerderheid moeten we alle wapens gebruiken die ons ter beschikking staan dus go girls sla de mannen desnoods met je tieten om de oren wat c cile muller doet vrouwen via hun schoonheid een kans geven in een mannenwereld vind ik prima ik heb helemaal niets tegen schoonheidswedstrijden intussen hebben we toch maar mooi een paar missen rondlopen die ook op intellectueel gebied wat te bieden hebben zonder miss belgi hadden die vrouwen het waarschijnlijk nooit zover gebracht grijp elke gelegenheid die je geboden wordt dat is mijn boodschap het is je eigen verantwoordelijkheid als je daarvoor ook met iemand in bed wilt duiken maar dat is nooit een goede oplossing gebleken ik ken mensen genoeg die via het bed iets bereikt hebben echt content voelen die zich niet
7774602 klopt 50plussers worden steeds meer gezien als een blok aan het been van de jeugd dat is een foute tendens want binnenkort zal men die zogenaamde vergrijsde mens weer nodig hebben in alle andere culturen wordt de ervaring en het geduld van oudere mensen gekoesterd maar bij ons worden ze aan de kant geschoven op je 45ste kan je al worden afgedankt omdat je te duur geworden bent diezelfde baan gaat dan naar iemand van 25 die vervolgens op zijn 33ste de hand aan zichzelf slaat en de kranten maar schrijven dat de zelfmoordcijfers stijgen
7774603 niemand ziet er graag oud uit maar door die cultus van de strakke gezichten en dito kontjes wordt ouderdom ook nog eens gestigmatiseerd en dat maakt het alleen maar erger de plastische chirurgie wordt ons de laatste 10 jaar letterlijk in de strot geduwd er wordt veel geld verdiend door mensen bang te maken voor hun rimpels
7774604 goh ik ga proberen ze waardig te dragen we moeten opnieuw leren dat oud echt mooi kan zijn dove maakt in de verenigde staten tegenwoordig reclame met beelden van een 96 jarige ex schoonheidskoningin die vrouw ziet er gewoon fantastisch uit m t rimpels weet je boutades als oude wijven stinken kwetsen vrouwen veel meer dan men soms vermoedt ze leiden er vaak toe dat vrouwen zich in zichzelf terugtrekken omdat ze het idee hebben dat het allemaal voorbij is voor hen zelf ben ik gelukkig nog opgevoed met het idee dat je oude mensen moet respecteren zon 20 jaar geleden is dat echter veranderd nu ik erover nadenk dat ging gelijk met de opkomst van de disco
7774605 die man is intussen 53 en nog steeds een sekssymbool vrouwen van boven de 50 wordt die status echter niet gegund ze worden uitgerangeerd voor ze interessant worden in mijn sector is dat heel duidelijk tal van vrouwelijke actrices tussen 40 en 55 komen niet meer aan de bak pas als ze oud genoeg zijn om de bomma te spelen komt hun carri re weer op gang tja dan zie je veel bitterheid opduiken hopelijk overvalt mij dat nooit dan nog liever af en toe eens goed uithuilen
7774606 tja de vrouw wil per se dat ik andere kleren aantrek voor de fotosessie
7774607 je moet er toch een beetje proper op staan h jef

7774610 jommeke viert op 30 oktober zijn vijftigste verjaardag en dat zal ik geweten hebben twee weken geleden heb ik zelfs even een
7774611 vorig jaar was het ook al zo maar toen konden we er toch nog een weekje tussenuit knijpen ik vrees dat het ons dit jaar niet zal lukken de telefoon staat hier niet stil ik denk dat ik alle kranten en tijdschriften intussen al over de vloer heb gehad onlangs zat ik ook in zomer 2005 de talkshow van jan leyers ik heb daar voor het eerst arno ontmoet ik kende die man niet maar het schijnt een beroemd zanger te zijn grinnikend zat dat hij was jong ik vertelde in die uitzending dat de mensen eens wat meer van een simpele zonsondergang zouden moeten genieten het is gratis en elke avond anders dat vond die arno blijkbaar heel schoon gezegd ineens sprong hij op me af en begon me te zoenen er kwam zon dikke drankwalm op me af lacht dat was trouwens de allereerste keer in mijn leven dat ik door een vent gekust ben maar wat die kerel zingt dat is toch maar wat roepen en hijgen in de micro muziek is dat niet als ik zoiets hoor moet ik onwillekeurig denken aan de ondergang van het romeinse rijk lacht allez waar gaat de wereld toch naartoe jong genieten genieten en nog eens genieten daar draait het tegenwoordig allemaal om in de oorlog kon dat niet hoor toen hadden de mensen helemaal niets
7774612 ja ik weet het de wereld is veranderd alleen jommeke is dezelfde gebleven nou ja grotendeels dan toch want hij telefoneert tegenwoordig ook met een gsm lacht toch zal hij fundamenteel nooit anders worden dat heb ik laten vastleggen in mijn testament van jommeke moeten ze afblijven nou ja als ze me straks in mijn put steken en ze veranderen er toch een en ander aan zal ik het nooit weten het begint stilaan tot me door te dringen dat ik intussen al een halve eeuw met jommeke bezig ben neen natuurlijk kijk je niet zover vooruit als je aan zon stripreeks begint ik herinner me dat ik na een jaar of twee drie zelfs schrik begon te krijgen verdorie kan ik dat hier wel blijven volhouden vergeet niet dat ik alles alleen deed ik verzon de verhalen schreef de scenarios en maakte de tekeningen ik werkte zeven dagen op zeven want elk jaar moest ik vier tot vijf albums klaar hebben sinds een jaar of twintig heb ik gelukkig twee tekenaars in dienst vandaag zijn zij het die de jommeksverhalen maken de ene slaagt er al wat beter in dan de andere om mijn stijl te benaderen maar ik ben tevreden met hun werk denk nu niet dat ik op mijn lauweren rust want alles wat zij maken gaat achteraf nog eens door mijn handen er wordt geen tekening of tekstballon gepubliceerd die niet eerst door mij is goedgekeurd ik blijf alles nauwgezet controleren het is tenslotte nog altijd mijn naam die op de cover van de albums staat h je zou het misschien niet zeggen maar voor een ander is het vaak heel moeilijk om jommeke te tekenen dat komt omdat het figuurtje zo simpel is alles verhoudingen moeten precies kloppen maak dat neusje iets te groot en jommeke is jommeke niet meer ik heb destijds op de academie natuurlijk nog echt leren tekenen dat is vandaag de dag niet meer het geval mijn oudste dochter heeft plastische opvoeding gestudeerd maar als je het mij vraagt heeft ze niet bijster veel geleerd op school
7774613 ik ben niet onder de indruk van wat kunstenaars vandaag de dag presteren panamarenko je denkt toch niet dat zijn werk over honderd jaar nog in het museum voor schone kunsten zal staan dat is toch truut in pakskes wat die man maakt trouwens zijn creaties werken niet eens dat is niet zoals mijn straalvogel h wist je dat ze op de leuvense universiteit van plan zijn om een schaalmodel van dat toestel echt te doen vliegen ik ben benieuwd hoever ze daarmee staan de echte straalvogel vliegt op waterkracht maar zij willen ook nog perslucht gebruiken volgens mij moet het hen lukken actie is gelijk aan reactie h ik heb inderdaad nogal wat uitgevonden in de loop der jaren eerlijk gezegd nu zit ik wel een beetje strop ik zou niet weten wat ik nu nog moet verzinnen je moet al die technische hoogstandjes natuurlijk met een flinke korrel zout nemen maar het ging toch altijd om dingen die min of meer mogelijk waren ik heb mijn hoofdfiguren nooit naar het verleden laten reizen want dat is nu net iets dat echt niet kan techniek fascineert me ik wou vroeger ingenieur worden maar een mens maakt zijn leven zelf niet h je rolt van het een in het ander en voor je het weet is er een halve eeuw voorbij het waren mijn onderwijzers op de technische school die me ertoe hebben aangezet om kunstonderwijs te gaan volgen hoe dat kwam ik had op een dag enkele karikaturen getekend van de uitvinders van de elektriciteit ohm watt en volta en daar waren ze ontzettend onder de indruk van tja wat doe je dan als jonge snotter ik dacht als zij vinden dat ik kunstonderwijs moet doen zal het wel waar zijn zeker lacht een artiest kon in die tijd het zout op zijn patatten niet verdienen maar toch wist ik mijn moeder te overtuigen zo is het allemaal begonnen
7774614 ik besef dat ik veel geluk heb gehad toen ik in het vak begon was het nog mogelijk om door te breken als ik vandaag met mijn tekeningen naar een uitgever zou stappen maakte ik geen schijn van kans om gepubliceerd te worden ik herinner me dat we in de jaren 70 eens naar dargaud de grootste franse stripuitgeverij zijn getrokken het plan was om met jommeke ook in frankrijk door te breken weet je wat ik daar te horen kreeg mooie reeks meneer nijs maar we zijn niet ge nteresseerd er wordt niet gevochten in uw strips is dat niet erg van kleinsaf moeten kinderen blijkbaar opgevoed worden met geweld terwijl het ook anders kan jommeke is hier in vlaanderen al vijftig jaar een succes zonder geweld dat was van in het begin een heel bewuste keuze van me in die halve eeuw zijn er in de hele reeks welgeteld drie uppercuts uitgedeeld zelfs de slechteriken zijn nooit door en door slecht zon boef als anatool wil misschien wel snel rijk worden maar het is geen moordenaar h ik heb in de loop der jaren heel wat kritiek gekregen stel je voor een stripreeks waarin moeder aan de haard staat kon het ouderwetser maar de criticasters vergeten dat ik ook vrouwelijke personages heb gecre erd die wel degelijk hun mannetje kunnen staan de avontuurlijke madam pepermunt gravin stiepelteen die haar man stevig onder de knoet houdt trouwens is dat zo slecht een moeder aan de haard ik heb nooit anders gekend en ik durf wedden dat heel wat vrouwen er direct zouden voor kiezen als ze de kans hadden
7774615 wat mijn kinderen ervan vonden om samen te wonen met de geestelijke vader van jommeke
7774616 slechts weinig ouders willen dit voor hun kinderen doen maar omdat papa en mama zoveel van je houden gaan we je leren hoe je later je man moet bevredigen
7774617 een man als fred is totaal ongeschikt om kinderen op te voeden
7774618 die eerste keer was de pijn zo erg dat ik dagenlang niet naar school kon ze zeiden dat ze me zouden slaan als ik iemand iets vertelde vader had het voortdurend op me gemunt op een keer werd ik vastgebonden zodat hij me nog vlug even kon verkrachten tijdens zijn lunchpauze soms bracht hij ook vrienden met zich mee die liet hij dan hun zin met me doen
7774619 ze willen in de tuin gaan graven ze zoeken heather
7774620 er zijn veel meisjes die verdwijnen ze veranderen hun naam en stappen in de prostitutie

7774622 heather leeft nog ze zit op dit moment waarschijnlijk in bahrein ze werkt daar voor een drugskartel
7774623 ok ik heb haar vermoord we hadden woorden en omdat ze me in mijn gezicht uitlachte heb ik haar bij de keel gegrepen ik moet te hard geknepen hebben want opeens werd ze blauw en ademde niet meer
7774624 ik kleedde heather uit en probeerde haar in de vuilnisemmer te proppen maar ze was te groot daarom probeerde ik haar in de badkuip wat kleiner te maken haar hoofd kwam eraf met een verschrikkelijk geknars daarna waren haar benen aan de beurt ik draaide aan haar voet en het been schoot los onder luid gekraak

7774647 come barack obama mark warner non ha paura di sfidare lo status quo per portare la gente insieme e far muovere le cose
7774648 come governatore warner ha usato la sua esperienza negli affari per creare posti di lavoro e una speranza per i cittadini della virginia
7774649 penso che ci sia una sovrapposizione nel tono e anche nella sostanza tra quello che mark ha fatto e detto e quello che obama ha fatto

7774709 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
7774710 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
7774711 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
7774712 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
7774713 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
7774714 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
7774715 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable

7774717 last year this was a financial crisis that we thought with a bit of luck would be over by the time of christmas but it has dragged on for a year and looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7774718 its fair to say that if you look at the shocks impinging on us this is at least as challenging a time as back in the 1970s
7774719 some people have said its as big a financial shock as the great depression and as far as the oil shock goes the rise in oil prices is in the same order of magnitude that we had to deal in the 1970s

7774729 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7774730 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7774731 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7774732 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7774733 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7774734 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7774735 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7774736 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7774737 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7774738 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7774739 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7774740 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7774741 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7774742 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7774743 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7774744 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7774745 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7774746 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7774747 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7774748 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7774749 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7774750 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7774751 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7774752 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7774753 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7774754 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7774755 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7774756 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7774757 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7774758 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7774759 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7774760 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7774761 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7774762 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7774763 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7774764 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7774765 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7774766 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7774767 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7774768 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7774769 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7774770 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7774771 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7774772 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7774773 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7774774 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7774775 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7774776 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7774777 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7774778 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7774779 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7774780 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7774781 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7774782 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7774783 drugs are an escalating social problem in ireland associated as they are with violence and gun crime alcohol abuse and anti social behaviour
7774784 however the political will of the present government to fight the problem of substance abuse has clearly evaporated
7774785 some countries are targeting certain sports that they know they can be competitive in
7774786 it certainly has come home to roost from great britains point of view they came from one gold medal in atlanta to 19 here
7774787 they looked at what they call soft sports and hard sports they decided that cycling and rowing were two areas that if they put the emphasis in they could win medals and thats what exactly happened
7774788 these are sports that we could do exceptionally well in
7774789 because london 2012 is sort of in our own sphere and it is very accessible to the irish public it would be fantastic to do well in it but we also have to plan for the long term targeting up to 2016 or 2020
7774790 it is too early to suggest sentiment is stabilising but the fact that irish consumers responded favourably to price discounting in the summer sales falling oil prices and less threatening news on interest rates means they havent entirely given up the ghost he said
7774791 the key question is whether the news over the next few months is going to get worse or better
7774792 while the improvement in consumer spending in august is very welcome it should be emphasised that current survey readings are still suggesting a fairly gloomy mood that is consistent with very subdued levels of spending
7774793 for the foreseeable future with continued poor mortgage liquidity limiting housing market activity
7774794 in the light of current difficult trading conditions the board considers this reduction to be a prudent action to take
7774795 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7774796 who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and our sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7774797 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7774798 the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital 10 years ago this summer
7774799 inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rear view mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands
7774800 japanese soldiers in the south pacific still fighting after the war is over
7774801 he has still got to get to the meat and potato blue collar workers
7774802 some kind of roll call but not all the states
7774803 then in november i expect to vote for the democratic party nominee because i am a good democrat
7774804 i really only know one person in new mexico who has said he will not vote for obama
7774805 disappointed that obama didnt pick hillary as his running mate
7774806 i have been a friend of hillarys for a very long time i joined her fan club four years ago i will vote for hillary here this week and then i will support obama i dont want to but i will i dont think he has been very respectful to hillary
7774807 we have already seen distraught patients remortgaging their houses giving up pensions and selling cars simply to buy drugs that are freely available to those using health services in countries of comparable wealth
7774808 we believe the time has come for a radical change in how the nhs makes rationing decisions for cancer
7774809 i feel great relief the professors agree with what we have been saying it is the first time we have seen so many clinicians speak as one
7774810 this will only be the first action we have got nothing to lose we are just living every day knowing we are dying
7774811 the letter is good for all of us if the government listens it may save me selling our house
7774812 if one group of patients is provided with cost ineffective care other groups lacking powerful lobbyists will be denied cost effective care for miserable conditions like schizophrenia crohns disease or cystic fibrosis we have not yet made a final decision on the use of drugs to treat renal cancer
7774813 det private beredskab til afvikling af n dlidende banker sparekasser og andelskasser
7774814 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7774815 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7774816 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7774817 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7774818 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7774819 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7774820 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7774821 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7774822 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7774823 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7774824 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7774825 there is no way i am going to jump down this and land
7774826 de seguida fazer upload do ficheiro para a pasta do servidor onde coloc mos o dump da bd e corr lo pelo browser
7774827 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7774828 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7774829 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7774830 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
7774831 e davvero una colpa cos grave reagire in male modo ad un comportamento inatteso e inaccettabile quando proviene da una persone cara
7774832 traballen en com n acordo ante a ola de violencia que ameaza os pobos
7774833 se as autoridades cren conveniente a promesa da pena de morte ter que ser finalmente detallada para evitar que no noso pa s poida ser acusado algu n inocente
7774834 many people who have known joe for many years and have considered him a friend are disappointed
7774835 many others are actually angry he has basically turned his back on the democratic party
7774836 a vote for lamont would jeopardize our chances for getting a democrat in the white house in 2008
7774837 are a bad reflection on him as a human being
7774838 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
7774839 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
7774840 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
7774841 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
7774842 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
7774843 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
7774844 it is all too easy to find the 100 women who will protest at the convention and they become the story
7774845 rather than to talk about the underlying numbers of women voters who in droves will vote for obama
7774846 people dont know yet that john mccain is just bad for women
7774847 talking about these differences is clearly a pathway to generating intensity among women voters
7774848 these swing women voters have tremendous economic anxiety right now
7774849 women are going to the watercooler and talking about what just happened in georgia
7774850 they are not unmindful of the way the world impacts on them
7774851 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate
7774852 when ted kennedy comes here to ask us all to pull together as a party not many people in this hall are not going to take that next step
7774853 it never stopped him he didnt go in a corner and weep he just started something else and now here he is tonight so tenacious
7774854 anyone whos advanced for him knows he likes a stool
7774855 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering
7774856 i have a headache from the altitude today i cant imagine what its like for someone whos got radiation chemotherapy and has to take a battery of drugs
7774857 their stories are very different but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
7774858 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
7774859 id heard it from a pretty good source last night but everyone was thrilled to hear about it at our breakfast this is the kind of moment that sen kennedy lives for
7774860 id heard something over the weekend but his health is such an issue it wasnt clear if hed be able to come
7774861 im a cancer survivor and i know how draining this kind of thing can be
7774862 it pushes the focus back on the challenge ahead and on obama and the race it gives people something positive to talk about
7774863 this may be ted kennedys final gift to the party
7774864 this says that he feels this is the democrats year and the party is not as unified as hed like it to be his appearance takes the headlines away from the clinton faction
7774865 happens to be somebody who i love to death hes just a good man and obviously hes going through a difficult time but im glad that we can use this convention to remind people of the contributions hes made to this country
7774866 just charges the atmosphere here the emotion is enormous its just what you want to start off the convention
7774867 its a negotiating tactic to accelerate the process of achieving concessions
7774868 it wasnt rashly announced north korea took into consideration the fact that chinese president hu jintao was visiting south korea the announcement was made after hu left
7774869 north korea is trying to muddle through and delay as much as possible at the same time this is a last ditch effort trying to somehow influence u s presidential politics
7774870 if the bush administration and others in the international community had committed to north korea going through with the third phase of completely abandoning its nuclear weapons programme well that was a pipe dream there was no way for the parties to graduate from the second phase
7774871 i think the timing of the hu jintao visit to south korea was very depressing to the north koreans that is the way they usually express themselves
7774872 north korea whether right or wrong has the understanding that even with this that washington and seoul are not in a position to react in a harsh manner this means that north korea may succeed in prolonging the process without giving up much
7774873 i think something that was quite predictable for north korea there was no other choice available other than doing what they are doing
7774874 this sudden move was not entirely unexpectable as the u s has irked north korea by delaying the removal of north korea from the list of terrorism sponsoring states and south korea and the u s did the joint military drill which was seen as a threat to the north those steps angered north korea and it seems to have come to think that they still need nuclear weapons
7774875 i do not believe that north korea whole heartedly said they will go back to the starting point in terms of denuclearisation process i see it as another card at the negotiation table to urge the u s to remove it from the terrorism blacklist as soon as possible
7774876 in the last two weeks this has been a gathering storm and i think that north korea now is particularly dissatisfied that the united states has delayed the process of deleting their country from the list of supporters of terrorism
7774877 secondly i think north korea is extremely annoyed that the united states and the republic of korea launched a large scale military exercise
7774878 for you to achieve similar results you should be meticulous and diligent
7774879 euroopa parlamendi moldova delegatsiooni juhina muretsen ma inim iguste olukorra p rast moldovas vangide piinamine v rkohtlemine ning mitmete muude inim iguste rikkumine on endiselt levinud

7774881 he venido a unirme a ustedes para cambiar estados unidos recuperar su futuro elevarnos hacia nuestros mejores ideales y elegir a barack obama
7774882 con barack obama el mundo comienza de nuevo la esperanza vuelve a alzarse y el sue o sigue con vida
7774883 ha hecho la vida mejor para todos aqu y en todo el mundo
7774884 hasta ahora no hab a tenido a nadie que me inspirara del modo en que la gente me dice que mi padre les inspir a ellos pero ahora s lo tengo barack obama
7774885 were not a public utility were a newspaper and we cover things based on what is newsworthy people who have half a percent or less following among the public are much less newsworthy than people with 40 and 50 percent
7774886 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
7774887 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
7774888 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
7774889 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
7774890 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
7774891 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
7774892 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
7774893 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
7774894 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
7774895 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
7774896 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that
7774897 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
7774898 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
7774899 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
7774900 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
7774901 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
7774902 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
7774903 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
7774904 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
7774905 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
7774906 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
7774907 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
7774908 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
7774909 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar
7774910 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
7774911 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
7774912 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
7774913 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
7774914 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
7774915 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
7774916 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
7774917 we believe that coal use will increase under any foreseeable scenario because it is cheap and abundant
7774918 should and will take actions to reduce the emissions of co2 and other greenhouse gas emissions
7774919 coal will continue to play a large and indispensable role in a greenhouse gas constrained world
7774920 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7774921 amen amen i say to you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up another way the same is a thief and a robber
7774922 i could no longer study because i dont have a social security number so

7774925 i have to put everything on the table i dont think its a good alternative but if they can prove that it is and they want to pay royalties to the taxpayer let us use those royalties to invest in renewable energy resources then we have something to talk about
7774926 oh were going to have elections were going to have them by october theyre going to be inclusive theyre going to be transparent theyre going to be fair and this or that
7774927 were not staying around for ever for you to get around to this you have to do it now overdue
7774928 help me out here madame speaker when does life begin
7774929 the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose roe v wade talks about very clear definitions of when the child first trimester certain considerations second trimester not so third trimester theres very clear distinctions
7774930 and if that in fact is a a a a good alternative then that is something that we should do
7774931 he does not feel that obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president
7774932 he should have called clinton and asked him for advice about foreign policy or suggested a joint appearance
7774933 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
7774934 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
7774935 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
7774936 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
7774937 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
7774938 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him
7774939 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced
7774940 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
7774941 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
7774942 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7774943 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7774944 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
7774945 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
7774946 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7774947 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7774948 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
7774949 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7774950 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun

7775079 the question for her as well as for him is
7775080 their big challenge is convincing people that they will continue to be active in politics and theyre going to continue to have a voice
7775081 an imperfect man with a truly progressive vision who spoke to and for those whom others ignored yes that is who i supported

7775111 we suggest that peoples willingness to take psychological enhancements will largely depend on beliefs about whether those enhancements will alter characteristics considered fundamental to self identity
7775112 i think its no secret and i have said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think that settlement activity is helpful
7775113 in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7775114 i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together
7775115 my hunch is that we are unlikely to be there because the majority sentiment in the party leadership is that we will be giving mugabe a platform to masquerade as a legitimate president when we dont recognise him as such
7775116 we are also in a difficult position because our national chairman lovemore moyo is now the speaker and we have to decide how to proceed we will have a decision in probably an hour

7775143 spiritual needs are so strong at the end of someones life thats when people question meaning and suffering and they deserve to have someone to minister to them and the garden is a place of peace it helps people replenish and be close to nature it is vitally important
7775144 ive been doing research at nursing homes for 30 years and ive never seen better care than what i saw at that hospice
7775145 if i were dying and could not be cared for at home i would want to be in that unit when we have something in the city that works so well it would be tragic if they did anything to reduce its effectiveness
7775146 they are right next to a garden but they dont get to be next to the quiet patients quasi comatose patients and they will have to share their garden we said you cant get everything you want but you will get some things
7775147 dr kerr says it is necessary to be larger theres a lot of merit to it
7775148 everybody is so nice i couldnt have asked for a better place i love it here
7775149 but dying is part of the life of this community we accept it as normal we arent treating the disease anymore we are caring for the person

7775152 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
7775153 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
7775154 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
7775155 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
7775156 no one works for someone we all just work together
7775157 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
7775158 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7775159 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7775160 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7775161 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community

7775163 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7775164 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7775165 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7775166 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7775167 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7775168 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7775169 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7775170 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7775171 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7775172 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7775173 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7775174 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7775175 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7775176 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7775177 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7775178 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7775179 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7775180 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7775181 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7775182 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7775183 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7775184 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7775185 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7775186 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7775187 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7775188 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7775189 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7775190 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7775191 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7775192 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7775193 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7775194 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7775195 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7775196 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7775197 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7775198 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7775199 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7775200 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7775201 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7775202 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7775203 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7775204 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7775205 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7775206 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7775207 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7775208 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7775209 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7775210 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7775211 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7775212 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7775213 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7775214 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7775215 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7775216 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7775217 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7775218 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7775219 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7775220 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7775221 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7775222 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7775223 i appreciate your concern but i would rather not talk about it right now
7775224 weve only had about 10 kids since we started and only about six at any one time
7775225 sometimes a child and his parents come for just one or two sessions and you dont see them again and then weve had times when just one youngster has showed up
7775226 when they first receive the news of cancer and feel a sense of crisis people will seek answers but often they quickly try to go back to their routine
7775227 i would encourage anyone to come for a time to express their feelings because when we keep everything inside it will often come out sideways in some stressful way that adversely affects our mental or physical health
7775228 on the other hand families often dont know what or how much to say because they are afraid of hurting the children
7775229 but younger children may not have the language to express what they feel so sometimes they will draw a picture of what the family looked like before a parent had cancer and what it looks like now
7775230 we are here to validate facilitate and acknowledge feelings you get children who are open and questioning some who are fearful some who say they are tired of talking about cancer and being constantly asked about it
7775231 but all kids are amazing they will tell you exactly how they feel especially the younger ones
7775232 we are here for children who have a parent with cancer we will be here for those children after that parent dies
7775233 but not everybody dies of cancer we also want to help those children celebrate when their parent is finally well
7775234 in your mind you think that maybe if you dont talk about it it doesnt exist
7775235 you dont want your family to be defined by the disease
7775236 i feel leukemia cast a shadow over our lives its always been there we knew it was there but we avoided talking about it for many years it was the elephant in the room as bills illness progressed we had to turn around and face it
7775237 and finally being able to talk having erica feel safe and secure to talk about it doesnt have to mean a family is defined by it we learned that
7775238 most times until this year you couldnt tell my dad was even sick
7775239 but his condition was getting worse and worse you knew things werent normal
7775240 in those early years i knew my dad was in remission from leukemia but i never really understood the magnitude of it all
7775241 at first it was a little intimidating going there because it was just hard to realize the fact of what was going on it was awkward
7775242 but over time there came this sense of relief just by talking relating to others who were experiencing the same things in their families
7775243 it wasnt just venting like you might with friends or family
7775244 it was actually problem solving even though you might not have recognized it right away i think it allowed me to take control feel that i could act and share with others
7775245 my husband had a background in psychology and he encouraged us to go there to kids konnected
7775246 in fact bill went along with erica and i in the beginning a nurse would talk to us while erica met with the other kids and the therapist
7775247 with all the changes going on kids konnected became a constant support in my life something i depended upon
7775248 certainly that was the case when my dad got sicker in 2008
7775249 there is a stigma to some diseases talking about them can be intimidating very very hard when you are going through it its not easy for anyone
7775250 its so big i knew what i was going through as bills wife and equal but i didnt experience what erica must have faced to find a parent sick and no longer there the person who was supposed to take care of her
7775251 i think he would have been very proud that we are talking about all this he encouraged the idea of seeking this help
7775252 thats the kind of way we were used to playing last year that was something we needed to see
7775253 that gives us a little confidence with the season around the corner
7775254 i tried to bait the guy a little bit but he did a great job and got underneath the ball
7775255 it was nice to see him regroup after the interception
7775256 to come out of the two minute situation with points is a positive that gave us a shot in the arm
7775257 we could have done a ton more we didnt go that deep in the playbook as long as we get into the rhythm and feel good about each other and what were doing the skys the limit
7775258 well probably start looking at cleveland probably more in depth now and start preparing for them
7775259 everything offensively went well passing game the run game just the way we moved the ball down the field
7775260 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7775261 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7775262 all of you are aware of the serious nature of this years fire season and the issues faced by the agency in paying for fire suppression costs
7775263 at this time the only option for financing the shortfall is to use the agencys transfer authority
7775264 the unfortunate thing is that it is across the board
7775265 i recognize that this direction will have a significant effect on agency operations
7775266 however we must be in a position to protect life and property from wildfire and do so within the funds available to the agency
7775267 the fire season in montana and across the country is far from over not to mention we have good paying jobs to fund and projects around the state that need to be completed
7775268 funding should not be pulled from our states resources to help pay for fighting fires in california
7775269 the costs are high and they need to suppress these fires to protect people
7775270 but the forest service is basically becoming the fire service
7775271 its amazing isnt it hes guaranteed a trip to the final its great its just funny how the shows gone you would think there was a script for this show but there isnt its like a movie
7775272 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7775273 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7775274 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7775275 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7775276 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7775277 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7775278 insya allah memori banding sudah masuk hari ini semoga lah lancar semua
7775279 private security is twice the size of the present police force and costs r46bn a year which is more than we make on tourism but has it reduced crime
7775280 no in fact sandton with a huge private security force is worse off than ever
7775281 it has been shown that private security just displaces crime in one place to another place or converts it into another type of crime but it does not reduce crime
7775282 in places such as sandton instead of opportunistic crime the criminals have become more organised striking in groups and coming armed expecting to receive opposition
7775283 the more we spend on making the criminal justice system bigger the less we will have to spend on other things
7775284 the country will have nearly 200000 policemen by 2010 but only 15000 social workers to deal with the social problems that contribute to crime
7775285 we need to look not only at the inefficiencies of the criminal justice system but we need to understand that we have to reduce the demand on that system if the plan is going to work
7775286 do we need to spend money on enforcement or do we need to put some money into prevention
7775287 lets solve that and then turn our attention to the criminal justice system
7775288 a few years ago there were 400 people serving life sentences and now there are 8000 and has it made us any safer

7775295 it is difficult to say who voted for who because this was a secret ballot but one thing that is clear is that the 10 mps from the small mdc faction did not go along with the decision of the partys caucus
7775296 this means that mugabe can no longer bank on the 10 mdc seats because the mps are not prepared to go along with their principals in the mutambara camp

7775317 our findings have important implications for both education and social policy
7775318 first they suggest that policies that change a childs exposure to classmates from troubled families will have important consequences for his or her education outcomes in addition the results also help provide a more complete measure of the social costs of family conflict

7775351 one day our hero grant a talk radio dj starts to get reports of strange unnerving acts of violence that are happening in the area they come realize this because the english language has been infected with a virus
7775352 there are three stages to this to this virus the first stage is you might begin to repeat a word something gets stuck and usually its words that are terms of endearment like sweetheart or honey the second stage is your language becomes scrambled and you cant express yourself properly the third stage you become so distraught at your condition that the only way out situation you feel as an infected person is to try and chew your way through the mouth of another person

7775376 his sense of comedy was intelligent bizarre and slapstick with simple narration and direction i have never been an assistant director to anyone but i carefully observed hrishikesh das style of filmmaking his films had substance
7775377 todays comedies dont stand a chance in front of his films i think the closest one to his style was munnabhai m b b s that is the one film in recent times that he would have been very proud of
7775378 when you watch todays comedies you feel that a lot of effort and pain is taken to elicit laughter i dont think that was his approach
7775379 i find it strange when i meet people who are born after golmaal was released and they say they like his mukherjees films and they watch these films over and over again his comedies were free flowing and natural
7775380 i remember him as a warm and caring person i never felt intimidated despite being new on the sets when i was working in golmaal i was a mother of two young daughters he used to tell other senior artistes i will finish her scenes first so that she can go home and be with her children
7775381 its more difficult to portray simple emotions on screen than complex ones and thats why i try to delve more into such themes i try to make my films like sugar coated messages but the sugar should not exceed the medicine
7775382 as a kid i used to watch hrishikesh mukherjees films in my video library his films inspired me as they spoke about real issues and treaded a real path while being commercial and entertaining
7775383 though i am still learning over the years i try to be inspired by great filmmakers like him i hope a few decades down the line i get the same kind of love affection and recognition as greats like hrishikesh mukherjee get more than 50 years after making their first film
7775384 i tried to imbibe his style in heyy babyy in terms of the interplay of characters i tried to keep it simple just like hrishikesh da i tried not to use many gimmicks
7775385 if it comes to my top three favourite films hrishikesh das golmaal and chupke chupke are two of them if you consider books timeless classics are not made by their content but by the number of times one can read it and still enjoy them hrishikesh mukherjees films are also like that you can watch them so many times and still not get bored his films were so light and frothy
7775386 the groups performance in the first half together with our growth potential supports the boards view that rio tinto presents a very strong stand alone value proposition for shareholders
7775387 the driver of demand for our products is urbanisation and industrialisation in heavily populated countries like china and
7775388 while the equity markets are currently focussed on downside risks we believe there are potential offsets on the upside based on continued strength in commodity demand low inventory levels and a supply side which continues to face multiple constraints

7775397 farm waste is not a burden it can be transformed into charcoal or even gas for cooking
7775398 but it is important that the part that produces the briquetts is modified so that they come out bigger local artisans can do this
7775399 this is an environmentally friendly way of making charcoal since most ugandans depend on wood fuel this kind of charcoal is ideal
7775400 they light faster and are made of pure carbon and magnesium they also burn longer compared to ordinary charcoal some of which is made from soft wood which may not be good

7775410 there are many different kinds of smiles but the true genuine spontaneous smile is one where the mouth spreads in a relaxed way across the face and the eyes sparkle or soften depending on the context and meaning of the smile false smiles involve only the mouth
7775411 if you were to cover up the mouth of a false smile in a photograph you would see that the eyes appear to be dead and expressionless
7775412 que expedienten a la compa a y le impongan una sanci n
7775413 se est imponiendo al consumidor un servicio accesorio y complementario que nunca fue solicitado cuya cuota mensual es de 0 0 euros desde hace 9 a os

7775417 i offered to trade her a fattening hog for those girls
7775418 i meant it as a joke ive said it a million times most people get a kick out of it
7775419 you might hear thats a good looking boy id trade you a pocket knife for him political correctness has ruined country humor
7775420 the way they planned it tonight was supposed to be sort of the personal michelle obama will talk about barack obama personally ted kennedy was a very personal emotional speech
7775421 but i guarantee on the first night of the republican convention youre going to hear talk about barack obama commander in chief tax cuts et cetera et cetera
7775422 you havent heard about iraq or john mccain or george w bush i havent heard any of this we are a country that is in a borderline recession we are an 80 percent wrong track country health care energy i havent heard anything about gas prices
7775423 maybe we are going to look better tuesday wednesday and thursday but right now were playing hide the message
7775424 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it tonight i promise you that
7775425 cuando mi esposo muri me qued sin nada sin dinero y sin poder trabajar no tengo hijos nadie me pod a ayudar por eso vine a vrindaban aqu krishna protege y da comida

7775428 perhaps its better for a bosnian boy to play soccer
7775429 the beginning of power sharing not by consensus but by issue of the electoral weight
7775430 it gives them a significant amount of power to build the legislative assembly into a strong force for accountability
7775431 if you model it like 2004 youre going to completely miss whats happening
7775432 in pennsylvania we found that the people who are newly registered turned out at a higher rate than people previously registered
7775433 every national poll you see is based on the 2004 electorate
7775434 i dont like to bet but id bet you the 2008 electorate is going to be changed in some pretty fundamental ways
7775435 we have great strength in pennsylvania and were going to be there in great force
7775436 even though sen clinton beat us in the primary we clearly benefited from the time we spent there
7775437 theres a depth of understanding about who sen obama is that is greater than in other places
7775438 there was a real opportunity missed there to hear from somebody who really understood what it was like to fight for the powerless that was his life i want to speak to some of those same concerns he had
7775439 youve got to be economical with your words though and the longer youre in the senate the more long winded you get
7775440 people dont know his story weve got to show them his heart his story of overcoming obstacles
7775441 i think because hes so eloquent and graceful people dont know he had to struggle
7775442 senators from both parties will tell you that hes always been willing to listen to other points of view
7775443 thanks for taking my calls when you knew i was calling to ask for money
7775444 youll always be my hero because you were willing to take on santorum
7775445 packed with armed men wearing police and security forces uniforms hit us with rocket propelled grenades and machine guns
7775446 im much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives
7775447 a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that america has a place for him too
7775448 i dont think you can duplicate that kind of moment
7775449 and when she was working and going to school at the same time there were a few patches there where she had to get food stamps to make sure that we had enough to eat
7775450 so i know what youve gone through and thats why im in politics politics didnt bring me to working people working people brought me to politics
7775451 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7775452 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7775453 we dont need an illusion of partnership when they surround us by bases from all sides they drag more and more states into the north atlantic bloc and they tell us dont worry everythings fine of course we dont like that
7775454 but they say they are deploying at least 20 at each checkpoint and two or three heavy armored vehicles
7775455 we will focus on a concentrated international effort to help georgia to get rid of the russian forces
7775456 alarmed by reports of russian plans to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia
7775457 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7775458 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself
7775459 watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it
7775460 i have a very honorable opponent there are stark differences between us
7775461 i know you have students who come from all over the world
7775462 i know there are people here who come from countries some from iraq where they have seen the look of war and sacrifice
7775463 hes been a fighter for the hispanic community hes been a fighter for the immigration issue
7775464 we have been forced to take this decision which we take with great regret
7775465 zardari pledged in writing to reinstate the judges within one day of musharraf leaving
7775466 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7775467 the fact is we had a very hard fought primary
7775468 there are going to be some of sen clintons supporters we have to work hard to persuade to come on board thats not surprising
7775469 the clintons love this country they love the democratic party and they are going to be active participants in our campaign for the remaining 70 days
7775470 bill clinton knows a little bit about trying to yank the economy out of the doldrums
7775471 it wouldnt make sense for me to want to edit his remarks
7775472 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7775473 reminding us how much we share and how alike we really are
7775474 you see barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is
7775475 he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7775476 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no you want a persistent president
7775477 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here
7775478 and nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7775479 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7775480 inspires me the way people tell me my father inspired them
7775481 barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7775482 and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation
7775483 those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7775484 seldom has an emerging leader so matched the needs of the moment
7775485 if you care about hillary youve got to work for sen obama
7775486 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7775487 we do not want to provoke the wrath of the lands minister mr james orengo who has publicly declared that he will not sanction land transfers that were irregularly acquired
7775488 since it was an election year and everyone was busy campaigning those behind the transfer were confident that nothing would happen to address the irregularity

7775496 as nearly perfect a little place as i ever lived in and such nice old fashioned people in the village
7775497 i must warn you miss potter i am more than prepared to like you
7775498 sometimes but very rare most women dont like this place
7775499 women go to see professional masseuses that cost 165 an hour
7775500 no dont bring your wife here i dont like when women come here
7775501 you dont want a massage there because you want to save it for your wife huh
7775502 he venido a unirme a ustedes para cambiar estados unidos recuperar su futuro elevarnos hacia nuestros mejores ideales y elegir a barack obama
7775503 con barack obama el mundo comienza de nuevo la esperanza vuelve a alzarse y el sue o sigue con vida
7775504 ha hecho la vida mejor para todos aqu y en todo el mundo
7775505 hasta ahora no hab a tenido a nadie que me inspirara del modo en que la gente me dice que mi padre les inspir a ellos pero ahora s lo tengo barack obama
7775506 i seek to apologise to mian nawaz sharif saheb i admit his feelings have been hurt
7775507 as far as judges issue is concerned mian saheb has himself said in his news conference that 10 judges were ready to be reinstated let them be reinstated and the reinstatement of the chief justice will also come eventually
7775508 we are still hopeful that he will accompany us in the democratic journey
7775509 i want to take along nawaz sharif as there are immense difficulties ahead perhaps i cannot tell the whole truth to the nation about musharrafs resignation
7775510 i take the blame for my teams disappointing performance in the olympic games
7775511 we did not play well in beijing and for that all of us are responsible
7775512 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7775513 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7775514 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7775515 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7775516 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7775517 im used to seeing these great big guys so when you sign them im getting my moneys worth
7775518 i looked across the table and there was joey maybe 5 10 5 9
7775519 the farther you go the more you become convinced youve got somebody special
7775520 moving up to this car now its more pressure but i can handle it
7775521 there were other options but i think for the long term and whats in the best interest of jgr the home depot and our whole team joey was the guy
7775522 racing is a lot of little things that make it every time i go to the racetrack i learn things as long as i pick up something every time i go to the racetrack its going to be great
7775523 weve had a great 10 years weve got some pretty good stats to set our goals at right now and to use that as our motivating tools in the future weve got to win at least three next year like we did in 99
7775524 knowing your son we talked about it and it wasnt a hard decision to make
7775525 du er tapper no n r han s nyleg er d d
7775526 nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7775527 theyre very aware that it may be the last major speech he ever gives theyre hopeful its not but fearful it might be
7775528 one of the highlights of the evening if not the entire democratic convention
7775529 i dont care if youre a democrat or a republican youre going to be moved by that
7775530 wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7775531 this is the first time most americans are getting any sense of who michelle obama really is shes a very poised and accomplished speaker a real professional
7775532 piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7775533 all of us driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
7775534 that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
7775535 i dont want to just introduce my sister i want to introduce you to my sister the girl i grew up with the poised young woman i saw her grow in to the compassionate mother aunt and sister in law she is the passionate voice for women and children she has become and the type of first lady she will be
7775536 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no you want a persistent president
7775537 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job of hiding it
7775538 having worked on the choreography of these before you need to grab peoples attention with a message early on not to let these sort of hours get frittered away
7775539 and if i dont play ill be ready for kansas city
7775540 yeah i sure do ive been playing a lot of football so whether you play or dont play in the preseason id be ready no matter what its up to coach i was hoping i could play last week
7775541 i was wishing i could play last week and it didnt happen and itll be the same thing this week im hoping im out there and if im not im not im trying to get better as fast as i can in the ways i know how its been making improvement theres no doubt about it
7775542 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7775543 clearly we found there are federal implications otherwise we would not have notified them
7775544 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7775545 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7775546 i swear to allah that i do not know them they were strangers
7775547 one of the womens names was maybe fadhila and the other was called widad
7775548 no no they put it on me and told me to take it off at home
7775549 i did not disconnect it because maybe it fell off me
7775550 dame mas gasoline or give me more gasoline fits in nicely with mr

7775555 dug herself beautifully and completely out of the hole she put herself in when she said her husbands success was the first time she was proud of her country
7775556 given her personal story the republicans wont suceed in future attacks on her patriotism this woman beamed her pride in her american opportunity women can relate to her modern struggle of caring for her children and constantly worrying about their future
7775557 craig robinson michelles brother has helped to put things back on track his basketball analogies about barack obama was some of the best validation we have heard about the candidate in this campaign
7775558 i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a us open
7775559 its a tough tournament to win rafa has never been beyond the quarters so thats definitely the advantage i carry to the other players
7775560 we are trying to make sure that one of us ends the summer off with a bang
7775561 no pact or an agreement should be set without being based on full sovereignty national common interests and no foreign soldier should remain on iraqi land and there should be a specific deadline and it should not be open
7775562 reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7775563 any decisions on troops will be based on conditions on the ground in iraq
7775564 that has always been our position it continues to be our position
7775565 there is no agreement until theres an agreement signed there are discussions that continue in baghdad
7775566 we cant neglect our sons by giving an open immunity for anyone whether he is iraqi or a foreigner
7775567 we dont want the phrase time horizons we are not comfortable with that phrase
7775568 give people a broader insight into who barack obama is and not just as a candidate but as a man a husband and a father
7775569 im not a member of any organized political party im a democrat
7775570 really the safest thing you can do is make all your food at home from scratch period
7775571 advisory labeling may not be protecting the health of allergic consumers
7775572 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
7775573 lo que m s molesta a ryanair es que en otras webs el cliente pueda comparar los precios de sus vuelos con otras compa as y ver que no son los m s baratos como aseguran
7775574 no se ha producido nada nuevo en rumbo los clientes pueden seguir reservando los vuelos de ryanair sin ning n problema
7775575 nosotros actuamos en inter s del cliente que tiene la oportunidad de acceder a toda la informaci n sobre las distintas compa as a reas y elegir el vuelo que prefiera
7775576 es muy complicado llevar a cabo un filtrado por el que la compa a pueda identificar la procedencia de la reserva
7775577 barack y yo crecimos con muchos de los mismos valores que uno trabaja duro por lo que quiere en la vida que la palabra de uno es la ley y que uno cumplir lo que ha dicho que har a
7775578 no c mo es sino c mo deber a de ser
7775579 y en estos tiempos dif ciles necesitamos de nuevo recuperar el valor de esas historias defender lo que creemos esto es lo que representa barack obama
7775580 he venido a unirme a ustedes para cambiar estados unidos recuperar su futuro elevarnos hacia nuestros mejores ideales y elegir a barack obama
7775581 estoy haciendo todo lo que puedo hacer y creo que lo he demostrado
7775582 muchos de ellos votar n por obama pero otros se sienten en la obligaci n de cumplir con el compromiso que les marcaron los votantes cuando los enviaron aqu
7775583 es un candidato que est listo para ser presidente desde el primer d a
7775584 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7775585 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7775586 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7775587 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7775588 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7775589 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7775590 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7775591 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7775592 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7775593 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7775594 i saw when the judges blatantly stole fights from two cuban boxers in the semifinals
7775595 our fighters had hopes of winning despite the judges but it was useless they were condemned beforehand

7775599 we will request nawaz sharif to return to the government
7775600 i want to take nawaz on board as there are immense difficulties ahead perhaps i cannot tell the whole truth to the nation

7775629 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7775630 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7775631 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7775632 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7775633 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7775634 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7775635 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7775636 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7775637 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7775638 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7775639 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7775640 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7775641 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7775642 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7775643 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7775644 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7775645 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7775646 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7775647 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7775648 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7775649 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7775650 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7775651 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7775652 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7775653 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7775654 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7775655 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7775656 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7775657 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7775658 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7775659 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7775660 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7775661 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7775662 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7775663 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7775664 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7775665 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7775666 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7775667 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7775668 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7775669 who are open to doing something on the production side
7775670 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7775671 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7775672 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7775673 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7775674 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7775675 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7775676 sometime this year we shall give them a grant for further capacity building towards the development of a new vaccine and against malaria called gmz2 that grant is worth over 300 000 euros

7775680 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7775681 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7775682 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7775683 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7775684 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7775685 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7775686 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7775687 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7775688 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7775689 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7775690 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7775691 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7775692 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7775693 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7775694 we ask and require you to acknowledge the church as the ruler and superior of the whole world and the high priest called pope and in his name the king of spain as lords of this land if you submit we shall receive you in all love and charity and shall leave you your wives and children and your lands free without servitude but if you do not submit we shall powerfully enter into your country and shall make war against you we shall take you and your wives and your children and shall make slaves of them and we shall take away your goods and shall do you all the harm and damage we can
7775695 the spaniards made bets as to who would slit a man in two or cut of his head with one blow they tore babies from their mothers breast by their feet and dashed their head against the rocks they hanged indians by thirteen in honor and reverence for their redeemer and their twelve apostles they put wood underneath and with fire burned the indians alive
7775696 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7775697 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7775698 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7775699 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

7775704 much as you should exploit your independence make sure that you are accompanied by a friend
7775705 we want to investigate this issue because there is a lot of money involved
7775706 we want to know why these people paid allowances to lecturers without approval this was irregular and whoever is responsible will have to face the committee
7775707 payment of un approved allowances violates the authority of the university council
7775708 i advised the accounting officer to further streamline the allowances payable to staff to ensure that only allowances approved by university council are paid and to have the irregular allowances regularised by the council
7775709 we wont discuss the matter until the issue of better perks for teachers is addressed
7775710 we are asking teachers countrywide to brace to fight for their rights the government has never awarded teachers any pay raise without a struggle
7775711 the policy is aimed at improving the curriculum and the quality of education
7775712 schools will have to choose 18 subjects out of these they will pick only 10 which will include seven compulsory subjects
7775713 we have 86 primary schools in jinja district and 45 of them are in kagoma yet the county gets the lowest number of pupils with first grades

7775750 basically the sector is one which will go along with the market and make much larger move so if there is a bull market now then one could expect large upside moves from unitech but otherwise there is a downside risk if the markets were to decline so that is what the investor is faced with one could keep a stoploss of rs 150 if it stays above rs 150 there is every chance that one might get at least part of ones price when there is a rally or if it goes below rs 150 then one probably should switch out of this stock into another sector

7775761 i love it because it is as glamorous as the foreign soap operas american and mexican we sometimes watch
7775762 but at the same time the family in noor is muslim and they have similar traditions and customs so we relate to them much more
7775763 i really like their belief in tradition and their loyalty to the family
7775764 we must not fool ourselves into thinking that because they are muslim they are like us the show reflects western culture and problems not our own
7775765 i sell more than 500 photos of the stars of noor each day particularly ones of mohannad the girls are mad about him

7775772 rather than it now be left to the whim or the will of the premier of the day it should be subject to the parliament of western australia

7775774 uranium is in demand around the world because it offers a prospect of affordable reliable clean energy
7775775 how silly of us not to be part of that growth how silly of us or how silly of alan carpenter to deny developing countries reliable electricity for health education and potable water
7775776 our industry can take a long term view of this
7775777 if you provide the facts and information to people of goodwill eventually theyll change their mind
7775778 we would expect a water tight law that would put this beyond doubt
7775779 but really as long as were living in a world where people are still carrying placards that reads
7775780 karena itu ingatlah kamu kepada ku niscaya aku ingat pula kepadamu dan bersyukurlah kepada ku dan janganlah kamu kufur terhadap nikmat ku
7775781 yakni bersyukurlah kalian terhadap nikmat yang telah allah berikan kepada kalian dan juga terhadap tercegahnya adzab dari kalian di dalam syukur harus terkandung pengakuan dan kesadaran bahwa nikmat itu semata mata dari alloh semata dzikir dan pujian yang diucapkan melalaui lisannya serta ketaatan anggota badannya untuk semakin tunduk dan patuh dalam melaksanakan perintah perintah nya dan menjauhi larangan larangan nya
7775782 dan karena lawan dari syukur adalah kufur maka alloh taala telah melarang darinya dan janganlah kamu kufur terhadap nikmat ku yang dimaksud dengan kufur di sini adalah sesuatu yang menjadi lawan dari syukur yakni kufur terhadap nikmat nya namun terkandung juga di dalamnya makna kufur yang sifatnya umum yang paling besar adalah kufur kepada alloh kemudian berbagai macam dan jenis maksiat
7775783 mereka mengetahui nikmat nikmat alloh tetapi kemudian mereka meningkarinya dan kebanyakan mereka adalah orang orang yang kafir
7775784 yakni kata mereka kalau bukan karena fulan tentu tidak akan menjadi begini
7775785 dan tidak ada kenikmatan yang ada pada kalian kecuali datangnya dari alloh
7775786 ini adalah dalil yang tegas dan jelas yang menunjukkan bahwa nikmat apa saja itu adalah dari alloh karena lafadz nikmat dalam ayat ini datang dalam bentuk nakiroh dan dalam konteks penafian sehingga ketika lafadz nikmat dalam ayat ini menunjukkan sesuatu yang umum maksudnya nikmat apa saja ed maka tidak bisa dikecualikan darinya suatu macam nikmat tertentu itu datangnya selain dari alloh maka nikmat apa saja baik yang besar maupun yang kecil yang banyak maupun yang sedikit itu semua datangnya dari alloh semata adapun hamba hanyalah merupakan sebab sampainya nikmat tersebut ke tangan mereka atau kepadamu apabila ada hamba yang menjadi sebab terselamatkannya dirimu dari kesusahan atau menjadi sebab dalam keberhasilanmu maka tidaklah menunjukkan bahwa hamba tersebut adalah waliyyun nimah yang memberikan nikmat kerena sesungguhnya waliyyun nimah hanyalah alloh azza wa jalla keyakinan seperti ini termasuk kesempurnaan tauhid seorang hamba karena seorang muwahhid orang yang sempurna tauhidnya akan meyakini dengan seyakin yakinnya di dalam hatinya bahwa di sana tidak ada yang dapat memberikan manfaat dan mudhorot kecuali hanyalah alloh robbul alamin
7775787 mengapa engkau melakukan ini wahai rosululloh padahal sungguh alloh telah mengampuni seluruh dosa dosamu baik yang telah lewat ataupun yang akan datang
7775788 kemudian sungguh akan kami datangi mereka bani adam dari arah depan arah belakang samping kanan dan samping kiri mereka sehingga tidak akan kau dapati kebanyakan di antara mereka yang bersyukur
7775789 dan jika kamu menghitung hitung nikmat alloh niscaya kamu tidak dapat menghitungnya
7775790 lihatlah orang yang yang ada di bawahmu dan janganlah kamu melihat orang yang ada di atasmu hal itu akan lebih baik bagimu agar kamu tidak meremehkan nikmat alloh yang yang diberikan kepadamu
7775791 syukur itu menurut asalnya adalah adanya pengakuan akan nikmat yang telah alloh berikan dengan cara tunduk kepada nya merasa hina di hadapan nya dan mencintai nya maka barangsiapa yang tidak merasakan bahwa itu adalah suatu kenikmatan maka dia tidak akan mensyukurinya barangsiapa yang mengetahui itu adalah nikmat namun dia tidak mengetahui dari mana nikmat itu berasal dia juga tidak akan mensyukurinya barangsiapa yang mengetahui itu adalah suatu nikmat dan mengetahui pula dari mana nikmat itu berasal namun dia mengingkarinya sebagaimana orang yang mengingkari alloh yang memberi nikmat maka dia telah kafir barangsiapa yang mengetahui itu adalah suatu nikmat dan dari mana nikmat itu berasal mengakuinya dan tidak mengingkarinya akan tetapi ia tidak tunduk kepada nya dan tidak mencintai nya atau ridho kepada nya maka ia tidak mensyukurinya barangsiapa yang mengetahui itu adalah nikmat dan dari mana nikmat itu berasal mengakuinya tunduk kepada yang memberi nikmat mencintai nya dan meridhoi nya dan menggunakan dalam kecintaan dan ketaatan kepada nya maka inilah baru disebut sebagai orang yang bersyukur
7775792 dan ingatlah juga ketika robb kalian mengatakan sesungguhnya jika kamu bersyukur pasti kami akan menambah nikmat kepadamu dan jika kamu mengingkari nikmat ku maka ketahuilah sesungguhnya adzab ku sangat pedih

7775799 the fact that the line of democrat leadership from kennedy to carter to pelosi were paraded across the stage without the clintons said volumes about what the campaign wanted monday night
7775800 for a year and a half obamas name has been intertwined with clintons tonight the separation was clear and purposeful
7775801 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7775802 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7775803 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7775804 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7775805 this is one of those great moments in political history
7775806 you know there is nothing quite like the kennedy name to light up any democratic gathering it was a moment that these delegates will never forget
7775807 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
7775808 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right

7775810 id been up since 4 a m worried about michelles speech and she walks in cool as a cucumber

7775914 since 31 january 2008 eckoh and telephonetics have held a series of meetings to discuss a potential offer being made for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of the company
7775915 the two companies have not been able to reach an agreement that the board believes would be in the best interests of shareholders and consequently these discussions have been terminated
7775916 however the board is still in discussions with various parties in which other transactions are being considered although none of the discussions at this stage contemplate an offer being made for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of the group
7775917 on january 31 2008 telephonetics announced that it had been contemplating making a possible offer for eckoh plc

7775919 all olympiakos fans the board the coach and the players that will play must understand how important this game is
7775920 olympiakos has to show strength determination and a clear mind on wednesday we can and we must qualify
7775921 twelve days ago we were very unlucky but hopefully it will be the reverse this time around with the help of the fans i think we can do it
7775922 all the signings we have made are signings of substance
7775923 they are signings that for yet another year will ensure olympiakos is champion in greece and i hope will perform well in europe
7775924 olympiakos has not made any triumphant announcements this summer we left that to others because the true value of a team will become clear during the season
7775925 this is fabulous serbia is now registered on the charts of modern culture with this statue of the apostle of tolerance i am very happy

7775927 ik was niet tevreden over hun verrichtingen in peking maar eigenlijk ben ik nog meer ontevreden over de aanloop ernaar toe
7775928 in mei wist ik precies hoe iedereen ervoor stond en ik heb iedereen een programma meegegeven en erbij gezegd als je dit doet sta je er goed op voor de spelen maar helaas heeft niet iedereen dat gedaan
7775929 pas in de loop van het toernooi zijn spelers fit geraakt terwijl we topfit hadden moeten beginnen het verschil daartussen is te groot en bepaalt of je een dragende speler had kunnen zijn voor zon toernooi moet je ongelofelijk fit zijn en dat was niet bij iedereen het geval zo kan je geen topprestatie leveren
7775930 helaas moest ik ook op internet lezen dat ik niet bij de selectie zat terwijl ik er de afgelopen jaren steeds bijzat ik had zelf al het gevoel dat ik een van de zondebokken zou worden voor de slechte prestaties op de spelen
7775931 we wanted to present an aspect of womens life in antiquity attempts that have been made in the past were rather generalized so we thought of public life womens only chance to get out of the house was worship

7775936 the eu will not turn a blind eye or yield an inch on this demand
7775937 they were bitten by bulgaria and romania and now know it is too late to demand more action after a country joins
7775938 we are working hard to step up the fight on all levels to eliminate corruption in line with eu demands
7775939 now it is up to the relevant bodies to put this into practice
7775940 i am not sure there will be enough political will to implement the action plans
7775941 i hope we can use this convention to help obamas campaign and his administration understand what millions of women in this country live everyday in terms of a lack of respect

7775954 they do a lot of good humanitarian work but if i was to have to name them i think i would have a hard time

7775978 siempre hablamos de la dificultad de las primeras rondas pero al final casi nunca se pierde para m lo realmente dif cil es jugar bien estos partidos porque aunque vengas con confianza cuando llegas a un torneo nuevo necesitas un periodo de adaptaci n porque las condiciones son distintas
7775979 en algunos momentos he jugado de manera correcta el saque ha estado bien pero creo que me ha faltado esa intensidad que es la manera en la que me gusta jugar

7775997 robinhos cycle in spain has come to an end and he is looking forward to a new project
7775998 the population of the world currently six and a a half billion is due to rise to nine billion by the middle of the century the developing world by definition aspires to western standards of living some economists suggest that nine billion people all consuming resources at peak developed world rates would be equivalent to a population of 72 billion consuming resources at current rates this is not economically environmentally or politically feasible
7775999 it would be a good solution if he made a move like the one by koukodimos
7776000 tell me it cant be done and i will do it tell me the goal is too high and i will reach it place an obstacle in front of me and i will leap over it challege me dare me or even defy me but do not underestimate me
7776001 you dont understand what is real and just a dream
7776002 well be looking to make one or two changes for the game not in terms of weakening the team because weve got a lot of guys who arent starting games who could be considered first team players
7776003 its a smashing game for us against a top 10 side in the championship
7776004 its a fantastic experience for our team and its a great opportunity for them to prove that they can handle their own against a team who have spent heavily and will hope to be in the promotion mix come the end of the season
7776005 i was pleased with it it was a reasonable point at a ground that is not an easy place to play
7776006 bowlesy was the most talented footballer i ever played with
7776007 emmanuel is a very good player its wonderful to watch him he makes your eyes open wide with some of his tricks but he can also do the simple things well
7776008 he played his position very well he played a bit off the cuff last week but he has responded with a very disciplined display and he makes the ball talk
7776009 daniel has got everything in his locker for one so young he has got great talent and hes also learning about the physicality of the game
7776010 they are good lads weve finished the game with five under 20s on the pitch there arent many teams who do that but we have to give them time to develop
7776011 they are not going to become superstars overnight because daniel is from where he is from everyone expects him to be a superstar but he is improving and emmanuels discipline was miles better than in his first game
7776012 the attitude application and desire of the players to embrace what we are trying to do has been terrific
7776013 doncaster are a very good side one of the best passing sides in the division and we nullified that and we had a creativity
7776014 we were first to everything the defeat at sheffield united hurt and we spoke openly and brutally about that in the week and put it to bed the response was a clean sheet today
7776015 they learned from that defeat at sheffield united and were much more solid today they made it difficult for us
7776016 eight of their players are over 6ft 2ins so its not rocket science to say you have to defend properly at set plays so were disappointed with that
7776017 its the first physical test we have faced in this division and we struggled to find a way to get a result goal com
7776018 hes got a suspected fracture of the jaw so he was taken to hospital for an x ray
7776019 hopefully the results will show that it was only suspected and he can get a clean bill of health he took a nasty knock and we were worried that it may have been something more serious than a bang to the chin
7776020 once we had given the goal away so early from the set play they are the team with the personnel of which the majority is over 62 we knew that defending from set plays was going to be crucial to give the goal away like that it was disappointing
7776021 i thought we rallied and we had enough possession to cause them problems but didnt really cause them that many problems you have to give credit to the home side they bounced back from a bad result against sheffield united and i think that they were probably a bit more determined and organised
7776022 we found it difficult to break them down we couldnt launch long balls into the box because their superior physical strength which would mean we couldnt score cleanly we tried to maneuver the ball and credit to them they worked hard to stop us doing that
7776023 the first goal changed the game i think when you score early doors especially at home its a massive advantage i though that the lads stuck in though and we played some good football at times but there was no end product today
7776024 i think that this was the biggest test for us so far this season we are only three games in but we knew that this lot had spent a lot of money and are tipped to do well and today showed why they have a lot of quality up front and they did very well
7776025 they changed their shape to go three in the midfield to match our three which we didnt expect they did their homework and identified our strengths and tried to nullify them and it worked for them i totally think that the early goal totally changed the game doncaster eurosport view from the terraces qpr our man at loftus road gives his verdict on how the new championship season is shaping up for queens park rangers after another home win at the weekend what are your expectations for the season mid table our strikers do not have enough goals in them to reach the play offs we should beat teams like barnsley and doncaster at home with little trouble you saw what happened when we had a real test against sheffield united qpr lost 3 0 and weve conceded six goals in four games including the league cup this season which member of the team would you drop in a second kaspars gorkss it was his fault that barnsley scored at the start of the season and apparently he had a mare at bramall lane his positioning is poor and he doesnt seem up to it well have to drop one of the midfielders to get martin rowlands back in maybe daniel parejo who would you like the hoops to sign a striker definitely an out and out goalscorer id have liked kevin phillips but i dont know if that was realistic weve got the players to make the goals but forwards like patrick agyemang and dexter blackstock although that boy works very hard arent going to get you 20 to 25 goals maybe a freddy eastwood or robert earnshaw type player who are your main men martin rowlands pictured he works hard is great at passing and as our captain is a real leader on the pitch he is not the biggest but he has got so much intelligence hes been suspended for the first three games akos buzsaky was our other star last year and when he gets fit he could be key again emmanuel ledesma is a good football player but im not sure if hes strong enough he might not like visiting places like blackpool lee cook can be a big player again we sold him for big money so hes obviously very good but hes got to get fit first after he didnt play much last season which club do you really dislike i dont dislike anyone a typical qpr hatred is brentford and luton but i feel sorry for them because theyre rubbish its harsh to dock anyone 30 points and chelsea is another one our fans dont like although we might end up a bit like them with the new owners

7776051 given that ana lucias bullet riddled body is probably entering the final stage of decomposition conventional lost wisdom if there is such a thing points to her appearing in someones flashback or via hallucination
7776052 the fact that cheech marin is also on the guest list for eppy episode 2 suggests that its most likely a hurley centric outing and after his encounter with charlies ghost last season its certainly feasible that hurley would have an imaginary run in with ana lucia

7776059 this latest message comes in response to inquiries from people from every corner of the world about how we can move more quickly into the new paradigm energies people are wondering what they can do to facilitate the shifting how the new earth will look and who will be with them when the changes happen as the council describes in this message its helpful to recognize what gifts we have and to begin more freely using them without caring whether they are enough or as good as others have the comparison and competition energies are definitely old paradigm weve lived with them so long and they are so much a part of the human mass consciousness that they are difficult to shake however the council assures us that we are in the process of doing just that during these times we are rewriting the blueprint for what it means to be human on this planet isnt that exciting

7776065 this is a test of leadership for john mccain if he cant pick up the phone and make members of his own party stop airing a television ad he claims to oppose how can he lead our country through an economic crisis or the war in iraq after shifting his positions on gun control immigration and tax cuts throughout this campaign mccain should not equivocate on this issue making a show of releasing your emails to the press is not leadership if he is serious he will get this ad pulled
7776066 overheated rhetoric and personal attacks on our opponents distract from the big differences between john mccains vision for the future of our nation and the democrats this campaign is about john mccain his vision leadership experience courage service to his country and ability to lead as commander in chief from day one
7776067 throughout his life john mccain has held himself to the highest standards and he will continue to run a respectful campaign based on the issues we expect that all supporters surrogates and staff will hold themselves to similarly high standards when they are representing the campaign
7776068 the gop should i be the nominee i think can say whatever they want to say about me my track record

7776071 to try to distort or to play snippets of her remarks in ways that are unflattering to her i think is just low class and especially for people who purport to be promoters of family values who claim that they are protectors of the values and ideals and the decency of the american people to start attacking my wife in a political campaign i think is detestable

7776146 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and me our country will be committed to his cause

7776161 winston peters went to see peter simunovich to show him the evidence of corruption he had against peter simunovich and stated that through a payment of 50 000 quote we would just slowly get rid of it
7776162 we are not going to suddenly have any kind of half baked serious fraud office inquiry conducted in this house by rodney hide qc the reality is he hasnt presented one fact

7776171 hydrogen vehicles there are two different kinds there a fuel cell vehicle and a hydrogen engine vehicle but the common theme is that they all have a hydrogen tank its just a matter of how they use the hydrogen in the vehicle they all have no carbon emissions at all no co2 in the case of the fuel cell vehicles theres absolutely zero emissions at all coming out of the tailpipe just water vapor that safe enough to drink
7776172 when you use hydrogen in an internal combustion engine you really have the same performance as engines designed to run on gasoline and in the future when we design an engine around the fuel well actually be able to surpass the performance of a gasoline engine
7776173 its going to take time we want to be in a position where the market will drive those outcomes and if consumers want hydrogen driven cars and thats the market the infrastructure will follow that
7776174 undoubtedly there is too much capacity in the new zealand domestic market
7776175 while traffic has grown load factors are down slightly market and yields have decreased but consumers are currently benefitting from the competition

7776209 one of the questions about this deal is why eds
7776210 was a tremendous success in showing the knowledge stamina intellect the political savvy that a woman can run for president come very close to winning and that the american people are ready for a woman president
7776211 my success as speaker of the house and the bigger step that hillary clinton has taken as president of the united states are not just about us theyre about breaking marble ceilings opening doors and leading the way for many many more women
7776212 i attribute it a great deal to the hillary factor
7776213 and her competence and resiliency and capacity have removed forever the question im shocked at how much it did remove it
7776214 i wonder if a woman could appear out of nowhere like barack obama and be taken seriously i somehow doubt it
7776215 hillary clinton has put the picture of a female president into peoples head but the bar for her is still higher
7776216 but the questions are gone we know a woman can be our commander in chief
7776217 in the next 10 to 12 years we will have a republican woman candidate
7776218 oh yes they are living in the motor home with us

7776235 mate no one in world rugby is playing the way their coach is talking about not successfully anyway
7776236 everyone has discipline policies and a procedure in their game the way he is talking is nonsense you cant just play an expansive wide game
7776237 this is still a very good squad of players most are even at their peak or approaching it so there is plenty of talent but what they need is the organisation and discipline
7776238 the hard thing for peter is that he has never coached professionally and this is one of the most difficult teams to coach
7776239 theyre attacking off everything and theyre going lateral not through defences you have to go through sides like australia and new zealand first
7776240 but he has to change his philosophy because it doesnt fit these players its not credible
7776241 peters big test now is to learn if he learns he can turn it around but if he continues to be stubborn he wont last long because his tactics wont work
7776242 if a company is doing badly then you blame the managing director so it is right and fair that the coach be held responsible
7776243 we should have won the opportunities were there but we just let them slip
7776244 im not going to panic because having watched the video again i saw how great we played
7776245 decision making in split seconds is new to the guys and it has been a bit worrying the onus is now on the players but they want to be in a confined group where they are comfortable

7776254 it was kind of awkward knowing that some teachers were carrying guns
7776255 i dont feel like they should be cause we already have locked doors and cameras but i didnt feel threatened by it
7776256 as far as im concerned teachers were trained to educate my children not carry a gun even police officers need years of training in hostage situations
7776257 i dont want my child looking over her shoulder wondering whos carrying a gun
7776258 when you outlaw guns in a certain area the only people who follow that are law abiding citizens and everybody else ignores it
7776259 i can lead them from a fire tornado and toxic spill we have plans in place for that i cannot lead them from an active shooter
7776260 there are people who are going to think this is extreme but its easy to defend
7776261 look how long it takes the police or anybody else to get here
7776262 if someone wants to come here and harm someone at least we would have sort of defence
7776263 theres a lot of incidents where that would have saved a number of lives
7776264 its unfair of us to ask teachers to take on the additional job of being police officers
7776265 v ksten i eftersp rgslen i dansk konomi er taget af afd mpningen i eftersp rgselspresset er imidlertid udtryk for en tilpasning af konjunkturerne der er s ledes fortsat betydeligt pres p arbejdsmarkedet
7776266 regeringen og vi ser forskelligt p konjunkturerne vi er mere pessimistiske i forhold til udviklingen i de kommende kvartaler og det vil sige at vi vurderer at der er plads til st rre aktivitet end det regeringen vurderer og s er det jo klart at der er plads til at vi kan investere lidt kraftigere

7776291 but in the meantime it is imperative that no eurasian challenger emerges capable of dominating eurasia and thus of also challenging america the formulation of a comprehensive and integrated eurasian geostrategy is therefore the purpose of this book p xiv
7776292 the attitude of the american public toward the external projection of american power has been much more ambivalent the public supported americas engagement in world war ii largely because of the shock effect of the japanese attack on pearl harbor pp 24 5
7776293 for america the chief geopolitical prize is eurasia now a non eurasian power is preeminent in eurasia and americas global primacy is directly dependent on how long and how effectively its preponderance on the eurasian continent is sustained p 30
7776294 americas withdrawal from the world or because of the sudden emergence of a successful rival would produce massive international instability it would prompt global anarchy
7776295 in that context how america manages eurasia is critical eurasia is the globes largest continent and is geopolitically axial a power that dominates eurasia would control two of the worlds three most advanced and economically productive regions a mere glance at the map also suggests that control over eurasia would almost automatically entail africas subordination rendering the western hemisphere and oceania geopolitically peripheral to the worlds central continent about 75 per cent of the worlds people live in eurasia and most of the worlds physical wealth is there as well both in its enterprises and underneath its soil eurasia accounts for 60 per cent of the worlds gnp and about three fourths of the worlds known energy resources
7776296 two basic steps are thus required first to identify the geostrategically dynamic eurasian states that have the power to cause a potentially important shift in the international distribution of power and to decipher the central external goals of their respective political elites and the likely consequences of their seeking to attain them second to formulate specific u s policies to offset co opt and or control the above
7776297 to put it in a terminology that harkens back to the more brutal age of ancient empires the three grand imperatives of imperial geostrategy are to prevent collusion and maintain security dependence among the vassals to keep tributaries pliant and protected and to keep the barbarians from coming together
7776298 henceforth the united states may have to determine how to cope with regional coalitions that seek to push america out of eurasia thereby threatening americas status as a global power
7776299 uzbekistan nationally the most vital and the most populous of the central asian states represents the major obstacle to any renewed russian control over the region its independence is critical to the survival of the other central asian states and it is the least vulnerable to russian pressures
7776300 moreover they the central asian republics are of importance from the standpoint of security and historical ambitions to at least three of their most immediate and more powerful neighbors namely russia turkey and iran with china also signaling an increasing political interest in the region but the eurasian balkans are infinitely more important as a potential economic prize an enormous concentration of natural gas and oil reserves is located in the region in addition to important minerals including gold
7776301 the worlds energy consumption is bound to vastly increase over the next two or three decades estimates by the u s department of energy anticipate that world demand will rise by more than 50 percent between 1993 and 2015 with the most significant increase in consumption occurring in the far east the momentum of asias economic development is already generating massive pressures for the exploration and exploitation of new sources of energy and the central asian region and the caspian sea basin are known to contain reserves of natural gas and oil that dwarf those of kuwait the gulf of mexico or the north sea
7776302 uzbekistan is in fact the prime candidate for regional leadership in central asia
7776303 once pipelines to the area have been developed turkmenistans truly vast natural gas reserves augur a prosperous future for the countrys people p 132
7776304 in fact an islamic revival already abetted from the outside not only by iran but also by saudi arabia is likely to become the mobilizing impulse for the increasingly pervasive new nationalisms determined to oppose any reintegration under russian and hence infidel control
7776305 for pakistan the primary interest is to gain geostrategic depth through political influence in afghanistan and to deny to iran the exercise of such influence in afghanistan and tajikistan and to benefit eventually from any pipeline construction linking central asia with the arabian sea
7776306 turkmenistan has been actively exploring the construction of a new pipeline through afghanistan and pakistan to the arabian sea
7776307 it follows that americas primary interest is to help ensure that no single power comes to control this geopolitical space and that the global community has unhindered financial and economic access to it
7776308 chinas growing economic presence in the region and its political stake in the areas independence are also congruent with americas interests
7776309 america is now the only global superpower and eurasia is the globes central arena hence what happens to the distribution of power on the eurasian continent will be of decisive importance to americas global primacy and to americas historical legacy
7776310 without sustained and directed american involvement before long the forces of global disorder could come to dominate the world scene and the possibility of such a fragmentation is inherent in the geopolitical tensions not only of todays eurasia but of the world more generally
7776311 with warning signs on the horizon across europe and asia any successful american policy must focus on eurasia as a whole and be guided by a geostrategic design
7776312 that puts a premium on maneuver and manipulation in order to prevent the emergence of a hostile coalition that could eventually seek to challenge americas primacy
7776313 the most immediate task is to make certain that no state or combination of states gains the capacity to expel the united states from eurasia or even to diminish significantly its decisive arbitration role
7776314 in the long run global politics are bound to become increasingly uncongenial to the concentration of hegemonic power in the hands of a single state hence america is not only the first as well as the only truly global superpower but it is also likely to be the very last
7776315 moreover as america becomes an increasingly multi cultural society it may find it more difficult to fashion a consensus on foreign policy issues except in the circumstance of a truly massive and widely perceived direct external threat
7776316 in 1983 4 i warned of a take over of world governments being orchestrated by these people
7776317 it was a criminal society that i was dealing with it was not possible to publish anymore in the so called respected publications my 30 year career in politics ended
7776318 the people of the western world have been trained to be good consumers to focus on money sports cars beauty consumer goods
7776319 we also need education for citizens to be more efficient in their democracies in addition to education for politicians that will create a new network of elites based upon character and social intelligence
7776320 on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
7776321 by the time i met him he is a professor of education at the university of illinois we served on a board together that had republicans bankers lawyers focused on education

7776326 human remains which rescuers gathered into 65 bags are almost impossible to identify unfortunately kyrgyzstan does not have a special service and equipment to make dna analysis and iran offered help
7776327 one does not have to explain the emotional state of the victims relatives so we must conduct dna tests identify bodies and hand them over to the victimss families as quickly as possible
7776328 but to rule out mistakes we decided to send those bodies to tehran for dna testing too
7776329 staff are extremely frustrated and angry to an extent in as much that their concerns are not being addressed
7776330 its becoming an almost impossible situation where you have a large group reduced teaching time and its not fair on the students
7776331 theyre getting quite tired overworked lecturers in front of them fewer teaching hours and also theyre crammed in large groups in these small rooms theyre not getting their moneys worth
7776332 this shocking incident underscores the terrible dangers and threats that continue to face journalists in somalia
7776333 we call for them to be set free immediately the somali authorities must act urgently to see our colleagues come to no harm
7776334 we are worried about their safety as we have had no contact with anybody saying they are holding the journalists and their driver
7776335 the quake was felt in kota agung in lampung province but we havent received any reports of damage there
7776336 we have received reports from our tactical operations group in davao that they have found debris near one village
7776337 we are praying hard they are safe alive that is our serious hope
7776338 the air force has been in the limelight because of our airstrikes of milf lawless groups
7776339 the air transport system is safe and trustworthy the safety control system we have while it can be improved is very efficient and meets global standards
7776340 this taliban organisation is a terrorist organisation and created mayhem against public life
7776341 as far as i can tell it is just meaningless how do you ban something which doesnt exist legally the taliban movement have never been formally registered so how do you ban them
7776342 even if the taliban doesnt exist formally it is nevertheless important that somebody has finally moved to proscribe them in this country
7776343 they have existed for a long time and no one previously has banned them
7776344 the ban would need to be followed up by much tougher action on the ground
7776345 this ban is a step which needs to be appreciated but there is much more which needs to be done
7776346 hundreds of small grants a year usually no more than 50 000 to activists neighborhood groups think tanks and arts and culture projects in chicagos most forgotten and blighted communities it has funded ex offenders to lobby for the elimination of mandatory minimum sentences and unfair drug laws organized senior citizens to lobby for affordable housing and pushed parents to get more involved in their childrens crumbling schools
7776347 i want a bigger government and to pay more taxes to them

7776353 they came across the group with the victim in it
7776354 he was bleeding quite profusely from the leg and they applied first aid they put a tourniquet on him
7776355 as it turns out its very likely they saved his life
7776356 he described them last night as two males wearing dark hoodies

7776360 under the municipal government act municipalities are forbidden to give money to for profit businesses
7776361 we do have the ability to develop partnerships with the other levels of government and this was done with the port authority
7776362 weve done the community capital grants for things like museums hospitals
7776363 what weve provided the money to is the port authority who are the landlords for this particular space so that they can improve the space for the market
7776364 and this is part of their larger plan to improve that entire waterfront
7776365 the market has had a number of locations most of them in public buildings
7776366 so us providing some kind of support is not out of line by any stretch of the imagination
7776367 ive wanted a train set since i was five years old
7776368 id be upstairs working late at night and id hear people walking around down here
7776369 dealing in hypotheticals is very difficult im not one to do that
7776370 i havent thought about a deadline im not worried about one thats for sure
7776371 in my heart of hearts i had no desire to pitch anywhere else
7776372 i would never try to do that i know its hard enough to run this club
7776373 at times its a little tough for him at other times everythings pretty good but hes always been a great conditioned athlete for the most part hes always ready to go the good part about him is hes got a way to figure things out he can do some other things to get a hitter out
7776374 if he ever gets to the point where he takes every at bat like its his last at bat theres no telling what this guy might do

7776380 theyre outside the fence theyre not actually inside seaview park
7776381 were just taking a look at it right now to see whats going on because we just found out about it recently
7776382 well look into it but we dont have an action that were going to take at this point in time
7776383 i know that we dont plan to take any actions at this point
7776384 although no question was asked about international aviation and shipping around a third of respondents suggested the inclusion of these sectors in targets
7776385 with more than 20 000 people telling the government to do the right thing by including flying in the climate bill it is hugely disappointing they have gone out of their way to sideline these responses
7776386 this is a very worrying sign that the government is backing away from the world beating climate bill that they have promised a climate bill that ignores international aviation is like a diet that still lets you eat chocolate it wont work
7776387 hes that kind of player he wants to go to the post every once in a while you cringe because you see him take a swing and dont feel real comfortable about it
7776388 i was just trying to get a little technique down
7776389 i had a couple things today my technique was a little off and i asked coach gash to stay and work me there was a pass block i could have done better on
7776390 i think ive done pretty good but i still got a lot of work to do
7776391 i know im young i still gotta grow into the position but i think im on the right track definitely
7776392 i wanted to come up here and see if i could contribute early hopefully ill be able to do that
7776393 i think i had to transfer the way i run the ball into blocking
7776394 to be physical and take it to the defense one thing when you block you gotta attack the linebacker you cant let him attack you thats kind of what i do when i run the ball
7776395 thats always a work in progress im going to continue to get better and every day come to work its all fun people dont realize in college i played fullback 70 of the time i hate to lose more than i love to win i want to help the team win whether thats clearing a hole and the running back breaks one for 60 id get a lot of joy out of that just like i do running the ball myself
7776396 at the time i didnt really want to do it but academically my mom really pushed us
7776397 it really paid off when i went to school because it eased my transition not being overstacked with homework
7776398 im where i want to be so it all worked out
7776399 im working hard to make this team and help us win
7776400 the games hes played in the nrl what he contributed to the kiwi jersey the world record holder there hell go down as the greatest new zealand league player ever
7776401 hes not just a good player hes a great bloke
7776402 as far as im concerned hes the best there is the best there was and probably the best there ever will be
7776403 i think the ultimate privilege is to have an encyclopaedia named after you
7776404 go on a website and theres a thing called wikipedia
7776405 nah man everyones talking about me i couldnt take it in being centre of attention very overwhelmed with the turn out today
7776406 and its not its the beginning of the next phase in his life in our life
7776407 just concentrate on the warriors at the moment bro ill open that pandoras box in a couple of weeks or grand final
7776408 the fact that people can be stopped at international airports around the country should be a warning to everyone that the court will take a tough approach with people who have outstanding fines
7776409 since it started 165 people have been stopped at airports and combined with nationwide publicity more than 5 6 million has been collected
7776410 i remember when we were in tampa with barrett ruud he was a second round pick and it just took him a little bit of time this guy is going to make the transition very fast hes very instinctive but you need two backers
7776411 i think that you never want to put anybody in whos not ready
7776412 that doesnt make sense hes a guy that as you develop youd like to have two guys where your starter doesnt have to play every snap either as youve got a nice rotation at that position then you start developing him as the season goes on
7776413 you never know with an injury you never know so youve got to sit in there and youve got to make sure that position is like saying weve got a quarterback and the second one dont worry about him well you have an injury you better have the second one ready that is a critical position and hell play this year
7776414 were going to see how much he can absorb but i think hes got a chance
7776415 youd like to see him a little bit and weve got to be ready to go
7776416 you give him a little chop suey over here just a little bit of stuff and lets just do that stuff
7776417 our punt team hasnt been tested in pressure yet i want to test it and test it
7776418 we gotta make sure our field goal protection is right too we had some leakage
7776419 he never gets beat hes always in position but boy hes starting to flash right now and that was good

7776424 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7776425 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7776426 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7776427 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7776428 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7776429 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7776430 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7776431 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7776432 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7776433 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7776434 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7776435 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7776436 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7776437 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7776438 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7776439 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7776440 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7776441 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7776442 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7776443 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7776444 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7776445 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7776446 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7776447 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7776448 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7776449 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7776450 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7776451 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7776452 my mom is a romantic person and i think i inherited that from her there are all different types of romance the romance you share with a partner but there s also the thoughtfulness you have with your children that can be romantic

7776455 the ships company is totally hyped about it because it is something that is so totally different than anything weve done before
7776456 i just couldnt imagine off the coast of nova scotia a vessel being held by pirates sitting a couple of miles off the coast and the police or nobody doing anything about it
7776457 it gives you a sense of the lawlessness around here
7776458 its the stray shell that might hit us or somebody taking a potshot at us or a terrorist
7776459 its these pirates and civil war and terrorism altogether that makes for as i call it a very interesting escort
7776460 rarely in life do we achieve something that we know is special is right and has made a difference in a world full of hate and strife

7776472 its a combination of circumstances personal finance pressure a nation who cant completely switch off on holiday and getting thrown together for two weeks solid with a spouse they wouldnt normally see for more than a few hours a day throw in alcohol travel delays bickering kids and a hotel or apartment thats tiny or not up to scratch and it all becomes a pressure cooker just waiting to blow
7776473 i think its no secret and i have said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think that settlement activity is helpful
7776474 in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7776475 the peace process is not and should not be affected by any kind of settlement activities
7776476 i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together
7776477 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7776478 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7776479 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7776480 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7776481 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7776482 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7776483 o will have his gaudy stadium event with his supporters chanting like some scary cult

7776493 hartwell medical has a long and proud history of listening to customer feedback and turning those identified needs into unique innovative and useful product designs that deliver consistently high standards of patient care
7776494 emergency care providers asked us to go back to the drawing board and provide them with a single device that would satisfy multiple standards and requirements while easing storage access and retrieval issues commonly encountered in vehicles and the incident scene not only have we accomplished those objectives with the new design were also saving them time and money as well
7776495 with buyers from hawaii to new york and from texas to north dakota electra is now home to folks from every corner of the u s plus mexico and canada
7776496 ive always believed downtown san diego was a world class destination and the immense demand from out of state and international buyers is only confirmation
7776497 buyers to date whether from san diego arizona or beyond were captivated by the project from the virtual home tour alone now that four professionally designed model homes are open within the tower buyers can the view the stylish residences and experience the luxurious feel of electras five star amenities for themselves
7776498 the main ideas behind our fall collection were color comfort and a spirit of fun
7776499 as two moms we know that comfort and practicality are key but we also know that it is fun to choose special clothes for your baby or to delight your best friend at her baby shower with an outfit she would totally love
7776500 rock and roll clothes and tees have always been a favorite for babies here at psycho baby
7776501 but we are seeing a huge expansion of this thought for fall
7776502 everyone who sees dr seuss new apparel line talks about which book was their favorite growing up and we see that with all our retro tees and toys like holgate they are classics and they open up a way to share memories between parents siblings and even the littlest ones while being totally fun at the same time
7776503 we love appamans fresh perspective and we are thrilled to be carrying the first season of their denim
7776504 the railroad and dark denim mini skirts straight leg and boot cut jeans for babies are totally hip but include waist adjusters that make them totally practical as well
7776505 cotton caboodle is a fave because it looks great is durable and suitable for every occasion in a little babys life their new jewel toned tees dresses pants and jackets have caught the eye of every mom and dad because they are just beautiful in their simplicity
7776506 our tee shirt line has cool graphics and jokes like mommy needs a latte that we are thrilled make everyone in the family so happy even after an early wake up call
7776507 a great gift is thoughtful and that is the basis of our super rockin and themed great gifts section
7776508 the joy of great gifts is that the posse has laid out cool stuff by theme so you can grab a cool t shirt or piece of clothing and work from there adding a toy book or accessory that makes a wonderful box of fun when youre done
7776509 i have never experienced a situation like this being two months without kicking a ball i just want to be fully recovered

7776561 what is definitely apparent is the fact that the internet and text messages are increasingly contributing factors in a relationship breakdown it might be that one of the parties has got in touch with an old flame via a social networking site or explicit text messages are being exchanged so while new technology is helping people keep in touch more easily it is also making it easier for people to stray

7776588 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7776589 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7776590 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7776591 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7776592 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7776593 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7776594 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7776595 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7776596 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7776597 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7776598 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7776599 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7776600 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7776601 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7776602 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

7776619 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7776620 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7776621 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7776622 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7776623 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7776624 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

7776706 unjury is a viable option for those who are tired of yo yo dieting
7776707 unfortunately most diets pose obstacles and roadblocks in the pursuit of an ongoing solution unjury works because it removes many of these roadblocks and obstacles
7776708 its just too difficult for most people to adopt radical changes in the number of calories they consume
7776709 for many the feeling of hunger serves as a constant obstacle in meeting weight loss objectives
7776710 diets often fail because they dont provide an easy way of controlling hunger and maintaining overall health
7776711 a calorie counter doesnt help when its 11am or 3pm and youre starving
7776712 dieters often avoid foods such as meat eggs and cheese unfortunately these foods are also good sources of protein reducing protein intake can have an effect on both weight loss and overall health
7776713 it appears that when we dont get enough high quality protein your satiety decreases and a sense of feeling hungry can increase your body needs protein the framework of every cell in your body is made with protein protein has an important role to play inside cells and in communications between cells sufficient protein is essential for a healthy immune system and good energy levels unjury helps the body get the quality protein it needs without the fat and cholesterol
7776714 the quality of the protein impacts taste and the value it adds to your body
7776715 the first thing people notice about unjury is the taste many protein supplements just dont taste good they can be chalky and gritty they often coat your mouth and have an aftertaste

7776759 the melodies are pretty and wistful the sentiments are dizzying and sad springhouse captures and holds onto a fleeting sense of melancholy
7776760 i kept looking around for the second guitar until i realized it was simply the deft interplay between friedland and heinemann that was creating those phantom tones in an underground music music scene increasingly dominated by noise and nihilism springhouse is that rare beacon of mystery and beauty
7776761 the music reaches many levels and spans several eras even as it remains thoroughly modern
7776762 every springhouse release is chock full of power and beauty and hooks guitarist and main vocalist mitch friedland constructs a shimmering wall of plectral tintinnabulation by running acoustic guitars through effects boxes and then sings over it in the prototypical voice of yearning and understated angst
7776763 ok i dont say this often and maybe ive only said it three or four times in my life but springhouses land falls does not have one bad song on it
7776764 with its punk percussion folk in fused pop guitars soaring memorable melodies and thoughtful arrangements springhouses music is as revitalizing as the first scent of spring
7776765 springhouse clearly stand apart a little grandiose and a little imperfect springhouse mine the middle ground between punk and simplicity and ambitious anglophile soundscapes

7776824 pusemos o pneum tico em frente ao navio japon s yushin maru n 2 entre a baleia e o arp o sab amos que n o iriam atacar connosco ali mas de repente dispararam por cima das nossas cabe as e atingiram a baleia que teve morte imediata
7776825 fic mos sentados no bote sem saber o que fazer foi um choque n o sab amos se hav amos de cortar a corda contact mos o arctic sunrise que se encontrava relativamente longe para pedir instru es foi ent o que o yushin maru come ou a puxar a corda
7776826 at a confiava neles no respeito que tinham pelas nossas vidas apenas arriscava colocar me entre a baleia e o arp o porque sabia que n o iriam disparar se estivessem seres humanos ao seu alcance hoje j n o assim n o estou aqui para ser um m rtir
7776827 sempre que um lado muda de t ctica o outro responde com coisas novas quando eles arranjaram canh es de gua para nos atingir equip mos os nossos botes com escudos agora adopt mos jactos de gua nos nossos pneum ticos para dificultar a vis o aos atiradores vamos ver como v o responder

7776831 hoje est o identificados mais problemas e al m disso est o todos interligados num cen rio de gan ncia capitalista acho que com a idade estou a tornar me marxista
7776832 h coisas que est o a melhorar mas mais lentamente do que o ritmo da destrui o do abate de rvores da ca a de baleias
7776833 no in cio nunca sab amos de onde viria o dinheiro de que precisar amos a seguir hoje temos uma sede internacional e escrit rios espalhados pelo mundo

7776835 h 20 anos era mais f cil atracar os nossos navios nos portos hoje h demasiada burocracia especialmente depois do 11 de setembro as autoridades est o mais desconfiadas
7776836 quando estive detido nos estados unidos e no canad perguntavam me sempre como sabemos que n o terrorista temos de desobedecer s regras algumas vezes se ningu m o fizer vai continuar tudo igual mas tenho receio do que me pode acontecer especialmente desde que fui pai pela primeira vez h um ano e meio

7776859 im not hanging my hat on getting a spot at an afl club next year but im definitely putting my hand up to say look my mind feels good my body feels good i want to continue playing

7776861 a knowing and willful attempt to violate the strictures of federal election law
7776862 an investigation of the american issues project its officers and directors and its anonymous donors whoever they may be
7776863 this is a sad ploy to circumvent the first amendment by a campaign who has no arguments with the merits of our ad its the classic maneuver if you cant win on the merits file a lawsuit
7776864 an appalling lie a disgraceful smear of the lowest kind on the senators patriotism and commitment to the rule of law
7776865 is inconsistent with your stations obligations under federal communications commission regulations
7776866 obama supporters have now sent more than 93 000 e mails to the sinclair stations that have decided to run the ad
7776867 other stations that follow sinclairs lead should expect a similar response from people who dont want the political discourse cheapened with these false negative attacks
7776868 how much do your really know about barack obama what does he really believe
7776869 why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it
7776870 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers
7776871 mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old
7776872 the fact that obama is launching his own convention by defending his long association with a man who says he didnt bomb enough u s targets tells us more about barack obama than any of tonights speeches will
7776873 thats what got me into this mess in the first place
7776874 im trying to install this fuckin light fixture and its not going well
7776875 that would be an investigation by the public health agency of canada and the local health units they do the food history so they would make the linkages

7776877 i think that as theyve acted extremely responsibly after a short while the consumers will forget about it theyve got a very short memory

7776879 were talking to all of them to come up with the best spot
7776880 one of them said i was his favorite player i almost fell over
7776881 no one wants to be in a hole especially against a team like this thats 148 2 or whatever their record is ridiculous so it was good to get out of that without a blemish
7776882 that gives you a tremendous amount of confidence to pitch to contact
7776883 pitchers dont have many opportunities to make sweet plays so that was cool
7776884 i feel good my confidence is up my swing is getting there im not missing as many pitches as i was before
7776885 i think this happens to even the best hitters you have to keep working to get better theyve been throwing me good pitches to hit i just miss them its me nothing else

7777037 were watching the system closely and trying to clean up from the weekend

7777047 congratulations to michael phelps for winning eight olympic gold medals i applaud him and his mother for speaking about ad hd mr phelps shows that its possible to go beyond coping with ad hd and truly achieve his candor addresses stigma and hopefully will inspire others to seek help
7777048 its important for people living with ad hd to pursue interests they enjoy and at which they excel
7777049 phelpss success demonstrates that being a part of a supportive family setting goals engaging in enjoyable activities and receiving positive feedback are all important in building self esteem phelps is clearly an exceptionally talented athlete and a source of pride for the millions of people affected by ad hd
7777050 among men there is a deep stigma associated with seeking treatment for ad hd i hope that michael phelpss openness conveys to young men that its okay to seek treatment that it is part of a wise game plan
7777051 its obvious to everyone who watched the olympic games that mr phelps has an engaged supportive and enthusiastic family who helped him find his right fit with swimming
7777052 this is my first convention its really exciting because it will be the first time im old enough to vote for president and what better candidate than obama
7777053 the way he speaks is a lot of it he can take an entire stadium of people and make them so pumped to be an american and so excited to be part of the political process he can just do that with words
7777054 i thought it was a good decision at the time he really didnt want to step on any toes
7777055 ive been to a lot of conventions but only one presidential one in los angeles in 2000 it was very hectic and very exciting there were 12 things going on at the same time and you wanted to do each and every one
7777056 she would have been wonderful shes a doll so well prepared so intelligent she thinks on her feet but now she recommends obama and im behind him 100 percent
7777057 that was so unfair so unconstitutional they were trying to take away one of our most important rights our right to vote
7777058 fdr i lived through the depression when all we had to eat was rice he really helped this country he started the wpa and social security
7777059 our current one ive always loved to read the presidents speeches and hes not very smart so i read his for entertainment purposes
7777060 last year this was a financial crisis that we thought with a bit of luck would be over by the time of christmas but it has dragged on for a year and looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7777061 its fair to say that if you look at the shocks impinging on us this is at least as challenging a time as back in the 1970s
7777062 some people have said its as big a financial shock as the great depression and as far as the oil shock goes the rise in oil prices is in the same order of magnitude that we had to deal in the 1970s
7777063 there are periods when markets look like they are getting better then another grenade explodes another bout of fear of sustainability of some financial institutions maybe intervention by the authorities
7777064 it has been very much ebb and flow and the mood here is very much one of financial caution as regards the next year we have our fingers crossed but there is the recognition there is still quite a long way to go yet
7777065 on the assumption commodity prices remain stable and if anything falls back then inflation should drop back as we go through next year
7777066 one would hope that the conditions in credit markets should gradually start to improve and those two factors will help to ensure growth will start to pick up as we go through next year

7777076 antes de volverme pro life hab a le do que en algunas sociedades antiguas era com n que los padres abandonaran a los reci n nacidos no deseados dej ndolos morir de fr o o inanici n
7777077 obviamente sigue diciendo fulwiler nadie est a favor de matar beb s y los pro vida daban a entender que aquellos de nosotros que defend amos la libertad de elecci n ramos partidarios de locuras semejantes a las de aquellas primitivas civilizaciones
7777078 un recurso lamentable pero era el sacrificio que hab a que hacer para impedir que las mujeres se convirtieran en v ctimas de embarazos no deseados
7777079 una noche yo estaba discutiendo el tema con mi esposo
7777080 todo el mundo est en favor de su propia vida
7777081 me di cuenta de que mis criterios para determinar cu ndo comienza la vida humana eran penosamente vagos
7777082 me encontr mirando para otro lado cuando o a hablar de que con ecograf a 3 d pod an verse a los fetos tocar sus rostros sonre r y abrir los ojos a las semanas en que todav a se consideran aceptables los abortos
7777083 yo no pod a creer c mo algunos profesionales pod an justificar con tanta calma semejante infanticidio sencillamente llamando a las v ctimas en lugar de beb s fetos
7777084 entendido el sexo como algo desconectado de la idea de crear la vida
7777085 en las clases de educaci n sexual de la escuela secundaria aprendimos no que el sexo crea a los beb s sino que son las relaciones sexuales sin protecci n las que crean beb s
7777086 incluso hace poco antes de que nuestro matrimonio fuera bendecido por la iglesia cat lica mi esposo y yo asistimos a un curso sobre lo que deb a ser un buen matrimonio vimos un video de un grupo cristiano interconfesional y en la parte titulada good sex no se mencionaba ni una vez a los ni os se hablaba de uni n de intimidad de mantenerse en forma la m s cercana conexi n del sexo a la creaci n de la vida era una breve nota acerca de c mo las parejas deb an discutir el tema de la anticoncepci n
7777087 el mensaje que hab a escuchado alto y claro era que el sexo es para el placer y la uni n y que su potencial creador de vida es meramente tangencial casi hasta el punto de poder ser olvidado
7777088 como postura por defecto he visto el sexo cerrado a la posibilidad de la vida he pensado que los embarazos no planificados eran como un rayo que te cae mientras caminas por la calle algo totalmente impredecible e indeseado
7777089 mi opini n favorable al aborto y me imagino que los de muchos otros estaba motivada por una preocupaci n hac a los dem s yo s lo quer a que las mujeres no tuvieran que sufrir a la hora de hacer frente a los embarazos no deseados
7777090 los beb s se han convertido en el enemigo que lo arruina todo
7777091 es lo mismo que hacen los ej rcitos rivales en tiempo de guerra deshumanizar a los seres humanos que hay al otro lado de la l nea

7777102 la cultura e la divulgazione scientifica che ci vengono propinate quotidianamente sono quasi sempre orientate a diffondere unontologia materialista sembra che parlare delle nuove acquisizioni della scienza sia soltanto un pretesto per dimostrare che tutto materiale che tutto si riduce a neuroni geni e particelle elementari in sostanza cattiva filosofia passata come scienza e rivestita di tecnologia

7777108 i felt like a piece of me had gone missing it was like i was split in two
7777109 i was kind of stuck in a repetitive thinking about the suffering that she went through in the last month of her life and the last few weeks
7777110 i wanted to know if there is something different in the brain when people are processing their grief in those people who are adapting well and those who are not
7777111 the question was are their brains processing their grief differently
7777112 this is the part of the brain involved in knowing that you want something
7777113 when people who are not adjusting well are having these sorts of thoughts about the person they are experiencing this reward pathway being activated they really are craving in a way that perhaps is not allowing them or helping them adapt to the new reality
7777114 one reason they are stuck is they are getting something pleasurable about thinking about and immersing themselves in memories of the deceased

7777233 when you do shop at the grocery store its very limited they dont have a very wide selection
7777234 i think if we had a farmers market i think we would shop more and eat more produce
7777235 were already outpacing 2007 so i think were going to see significant growth
7777236 it helps the local farmer it helps the families both stretch their food dollars and makes sure they are getting access to fruits and vegetables
7777237 its embedded in our history now its part of our dna you cant take that away
7777238 they would be as successful today as they were in their own era because of their ability to adapt not only to their audiences but to the era they were playing in
7777239 they had a very unique ability to integrate themselves into any audience demographic
7777240 it really helps from on high to have somebody that you revere that you care about and want to hear what theyre saying and doing and what theyre wearing everything
7777241 thats important for us whether its an apparition or not
7777242 people are looking back now because were in a very similar situation to 68 an unpopular war an unpopular president whos waging it serious domestic problems
7777243 people ached to feel noble in 1968 and they ache to feel noble again
7777244 people sense theres a similarity between the two periods and it makes the kennedys more interesting to them

7777247 it is time again for a new generation of leadership it is time now for barack obama
7777248 obviously she knew while shes the victim she clearly didnt stand in the way of the cover up
7777249 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
7777250 the question for her as well as for him is what is their foundation what gives them a platform to engage in public issues
7777251 their big challenge is convincing people that they will continue to be active in politics and theyre going to continue to have a voice
7777252 an imperfect man with a truly progressive vision who spoke to and for those whom others ignored yes that is who i supported
7777253 an imperfect man who had come to face his own imperfections and was seeking to redeem himself to those closest to him yes that is who i supported
7777254 she knew she should not have participated in him running for president with this bomb waiting to go off she did she kinda loses my sympathy
7777255 i believe we are all owed a huge apology not self serving claims for pity by both john and elizabeth edwards who both knew about the affair and both decided to go forward and seek the democratic candidacy regardless of the titanic risk
7777256 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
7777257 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
7777258 i thought it was very naive on both their parts
7777259 it would be very sad if he were the nominee of our party right now

7777274 the government of afghanistan has repeatedly discussed the issue of civilian casualties with the international forces and asked for all air raids on civilian targets especially in afghan villages to be stopped
7777275 the issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids

7777327 modern real estate auctions are nothing more than a bait and switch scheme to lure hopeful buyers to submit offers that can later be accepted or rejected by the lenders sellers despite the general publics perception that once the auctioneer declares sold the property is in fact sold

7777356 his sense of comedy was intelligent bizarre and slapstick with simple narration and direction i have never been an assistant director to anyone but i carefully observed hrishikesh das style of filmmaking his films had substance
7777357 todays comedies dont stand a chance in front of his films i think the closest one to his style was munnabhai m b b s that is the one film in recent times that he would have been very proud of
7777358 when you watch todays comedies you feel that a lot of effort and pain is taken to elicit laughter i dont think that was his approach
7777359 i find it strange when i meet people who are born after golmaal was released and they say they like his mukherjees films and they watch these films over and over again his comedies were free flowing and natural
7777360 i remember him as a warm and caring person i never felt intimidated despite being new on the sets when i was working in golmaal i was a mother of two young daughters he used to tell other senior artistes i will finish her scenes first so that she can go home and be with her children
7777361 its more difficult to portray simple emotions on screen than complex ones and thats why i try to delve more into such themes i try to make my films like sugar coated messages but the sugar should not exceed the medicine
7777362 as a kid i used to watch hrishikesh mukherjees films in my video library his films inspired me as they spoke about real issues and treaded a real path while being commercial and entertaining
7777363 though i am still learning over the years i try to be inspired by great filmmakers like him i hope a few decades down the line i get the same kind of love affection and recognition as greats like hrishikesh mukherjee get more than 50 years after making their first film
7777364 i tried to imbibe his style in heyy babyy in terms of the interplay of characters i tried to keep it simple just like hrishikesh da i tried not to use many gimmicks
7777365 if it comes to my top three favourite films hrishikesh das golmaal and chupke chupke are two of them if you consider books timeless classics are not made by their content but by the number of times one can read it and still enjoy them hrishikesh mukherjees films are also like that you can watch them so many times and still not get bored his films were so light and frothy
7777366 obama has real appeal out here particularly with independent voters
7777367 the obama campaign is sadly mistaken if they think raising taxes on people who make 42 000 a year lacking an energy plan that reduces the price at the pump and selecting a who doesnt think you have the experience to be president is the way to win votes in the west
7777368 those are the kinds of worries that have led the people of the western states to say we need common sense practical leaders

7777403 the use of paramilitary death squads promoted financed and protected by the uribe regime to murder and disappear popular leaders serves several strategic political goals
7777404 it allows the regime to lower the number of human rights abuses attributed to the colombian armed forces it facilitates the extensive use of extreme terror tactics to intimidate entire communities it creates the myth that the regime is centrist opposed by the extreme left farc and the extreme right death squads
7777405 this claim is particularly effective in furthering the regimes diplomatic relations in the us and europe

7777418 i have been in discussions for a number of months with the rfu aimed at growing the game not just at regional level but at premiership level too
7777419 we would like to see it happening in september 2009
7777420 there is a bit more work to be done and a lot more talking but i have already alerted the regions and invited bob norster of the cardiff blues to join me at the next meeting with the rfu
7777421 there are also implications for the premiership and this is something i will be discussing with those clubs in a few weeks time
7777422 this is something that should be seen as very exciting and dynamic for welsh rugby

7777499 we will ban by legislation the mining of uranium in western australia and instead we will drive 100 per cent renewable energy production
7777500 uranium is in demand around the world because it offers a prospect of affordable reliable clean energy
7777501 how silly of us not to be part of that growth how silly of us or how silly of alan carpenter to deny developing countries reliable electricity for health education and potable water

7777523 i knew it wasnt an engine problem there was a sudden drop in temperature and a rush of cold air you think to yourself god is there a hole in the aircraft it actually felt like someone had opened a door at the back of the aircraft it was incredibly cold
7777524 the next thing the oxygen masks were dropping my highest priority was to get a mask on to my son who was sitting next to me in a bemused and frightened state we were descending for about five minutes from what i assume was 30 000 or 40 000ft to 8 000ft as we landed we saw fire engines every quarter of a mile down the runway
7777525 mine wasnt filling up with oxygen and neither was my sons
7777526 from where i was sitting i could see about 20 masks and only a few of them were inflating
7777527 it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
7777528 the oxygen masks were working the correct safety procedures were followed
7777529 the first thing we do in these situations is divert to safety take the safety first option
7777530 we have to require that the pilots and the cabin crew also deploy their oxygen masks they cant be making passenger pa announcements when they have their oxygen masks on as the passengers confirmed the pilot did make an announcement once he got down to 8 000ft where it is safe to take the oxygen masks off that they were diverting to limoges
7777531 ryanair confirms that the fr9336 from bristol airport to barcelona girona airport on the evening of august 25 experienced an inflight depressurisation incident which caused the oxygen masks on board to deploy all 168 passengers disembarked safely upon landing a total of 16 passengers together with five accompanying family members have transferred at their request to a local hospital complaining of earache

7777560 they believed like you and i believe that america should be a place where you can make it if you try
7777561 reminded us that we know what our world should look like he said we know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like and he urged us to believe in ourselves to find the strength within ourselves to strive for the world as it should be and isnt that the great american story
7777562 each of us also comes here tonight by way of our own improbable journey
7777563 all of us are driven by the simple belief that the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
7777564 and that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope and you see that is why i love this country
7777565 tonight she kind of verified that she did love america
7777566 she allowed us to see her as a mother and as a wife and not so strong willed and independent
7777567 to really describe from her heart her family her roots the values by which she was raised the same values by which barack was raised
7777568 what weve seen in the past about michelle has been a complete distortion of the michelle obama that i know
7777569 some people will finally see that hes not a muslim hes a christian and a family man
7777570 and one day they and your sons and daughters will tell their own children about what we did together in this election theyll tell them how this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears how this time we decided to stop doubting and to start dreaming how this time in this great country where a girl from the south side of chicago can go to college and law school and the son of a single mother from hawaii can go all the way to the white house we committed ourselves to building the world as it should be
7777571 i come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to its best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states

7777575 the torch will be passed again to a generation of americans
7777576 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7777577 we are told that barack obama believes too much in an america of high purpose and bold endeavor
7777578 but when john kennedy thought of going to the moon he didnt say its too far to get there we shouldnt even try our people answered his call to rise to the challenge and today an american flag still marks the surface of the moon
7777579 this is what we do we reach the moon we scale the heights i know it ive seen it ive lived it and we can do it again
7777580 he kicked the convention off in a way that passes the torch to a new generation of americans and put it in historical perspective in a way that only he could having been at his brothers side in 1960
7777581 i love him i wish he was running for president
7777582 was a reminder of how good we were and how good we can be once more
7777583 extraordinary record for nearly 50 years of public life of trying to lift others up
7777584 his presence alone is a huge lift to all the people in that hall and for all the people watching
7777585 he knows that his personal imprimatur was a defining moment in the obama campaign
7777586 the theme of this convention is going to be creating a family out of a politically fractured crowd

7777588 weve been to a lot of weddings and we wanted ours to be different
7777589 we didnt want to do what i call the eighth grade shuffle which is usually as painful for the couple as it is for the guests
7777590 they make couples realize they can learn to dance too usually the couple has been to a lot of boring weddings and want their guests to be entertained they are willing to take more chances at expressing what their personality is and this is one more way to do that
7777591 were not changing into leg warmers and dressing up as sonny and cher
7777592 were doing salsa and mambo moves mixed with hip hop we just want to loosen everyone up so many times people dance to a slow song and its romantic and beautiful but we want to be nontraditional fun funky and interesting
7777593 you can see in the video there are some uncomfortable faces they thought something went wrong with the music
7777594 there were a few times before the wedding that we asked ourselves is this going to be offensive are we being crazy to do this but when we started dancing people were screaming and clapping in amazement
7777595 it never occurred to us it would be a big deal after the fact
7777596 my dad hadnt danced since he danced with my mom at his wedding and even then i think they just danced once
7777597 hes a funny guy it wont be your typical tango were using props ill have a rose in my teeth
7777598 we found a karaoke version of the song on itunes then at the wedding we put it in the ipod started snapping our fingers dancing and then we started to sing

7777999 we dont understand the purpose of sleep but it must be important because all animals do it
7778000 the very fact that dolphins have developed the remarkable specialization rather than merely getting rid of sleep altogether should count as evidence that sleep must serve some essential function and cannot be eliminated
7778001 sleep may be the price you pay so your brain can be plastic the next day
7778002 while there may still be no consensus on why animals need to sleep it would seem that searching for a core function of sleep particularly at the cellular level is still a worthwhile exercise

7778033 laumento delle put options la dice lunga sulle prospettive del settore
7778034 perch vengono usate quando si presume che il costo del barile scender al di sotto di un limite prestabilito a questo punto ogni previsione oltre i tre mesi un esercizio futile
7778035 non vorrei che questo forte calo del prezzo contribuisca a far restare litalia nella sua posizione di stallo sul fronte della politica energetica da anni litalia non prende decisioni strategiche non studia un piano energetico che ci liberi dalleccessiva dipendenza del petrolio non vorrei che nellillusione di veder tornare il petrolio ai livelli di qualche anno fa ogni progetto alternativo venisse rimesso nel cassetto
7778036 se la tendenza in atto prosegue nei prossimi mesi qualche beneficio per le famiglie italiane e il loro potere dacquisto ci sar soprattutto se il calo del greggio non dipender da una recessione delleconomia globale uno scenario che non appare coerente con landamento delle borse internazionali
7778037 attualmente le put le opzioni di vendita trattate sul nymex che danno il barile a 100 dollari entro fine anno sono oltre 50 mila si suppone che vendendole a questa cifra i trader realizzeranno un bel guadagno visto che il contratto put offre loro la possibilit di cedere a un prezzo prefissato anche se il greggio scendesse sotto quel livello di prezzo

7778053 rasulullah saw melaknat penyuap penerima suap dan orang yang menyaksikan penyuapan
7778054 perhiasan itu untuk anda tetapi ringankanlah kami dan berikan kepada kami bagian lebih dari separuh
7778055 hai kaum yahudi demi allah kalian memang manusia manusia hamba allah yang paling kubenci apa yang kalian lakukan ini justru mendorong diriku lebih merendahkan kalian suap yang kalian tawarkan itu adalah barang haram dan kaum muslim tidak memakannya
7778056 hadiah yang diberikan kepada para penguasa adalah suht haram dan suap yang diterima hakim adalah kufur
7778057 amma badu aku telah mempekerjakan beberapa orang di antara kalian untuk melaksanakan tugas yang dipercayakan allah swt
7778058 ini kuserahkan kepada anda sedangkan ini adalah hadiah yang diberikan orang kepadaku
7778059 sehingga apabila mereka sampai ke neraka pedengaran penglihatan dan kulit mereka menjadi saksi terhadap mereka tentang apa yang telah mereka kerjakan
7778060 kamu sekali kali tidak dapat bersembunyi dari persaksian pendengaran penglihatan dan kulitmu terhadapmu bahkan kamu mengira bahwa allah tidak mengetahui kebanyakan dari apa yang kamu kerjakan adapun yang demikian itu adalah prasangkamu yang telah kamu sangka terhadap tuhanmu dia telah membinasakan kamu maka jadilah kamu termasuk orang orang yang merugi
7778061 apabila kalian melihatku menyimpang dari jalan islam maka luruskanlah aku walaupun dengan pedang
7778062 kalau begitu demi allah aku akan meluruskanmu dengan pedang ini
7778063 allah swt telah mewajibkan kepada kaum muslim untuk melakukan koreksi kepada penguasa mereka perintah kepada mereka agar mengubah para penguasa tersebut bersifat tegas apabila mereka merampas hak hak rakyat mengabaikan kewajiban kewajiban rakyat melalaikan salah satu urusan rakyat menyimpang dari hukum hukum islam atau memerintah dengan selain hukum yang diturunkan oleh allah swt
7778064 hendaknya ada di antara kalian sekelompok umat yang mengajak kepada kebaikan serta menyeru pada kemakrufan dan mencegah dari kemunkaran
7778065 siapa saja di antara kalian yang melihat kemunkaran maka hendaknya dia mengubahnya dengan tangannya apabila tidak mampu maka dengan lisannya apabila tidak mampu maka dengan hatinya itulah selemah lemahnya iman
7778066 sebaik baik jihad adalah menyatakan kata kata yang haq di depan penguasa yang zalim
7778067 penghulu para syuhada adalah hamzah serta orang yang berdiri di hadapan seorang penguasa yang zalim lalu memerintahkannya berbuat makruf dan mencegahnya berbuat munkar lalu penguasa itu membunuhnya
7778068 apabila suatu kewajiban tidak sempurna ditunaikan kecuali dengan adanya suatu perkara maka mewujudkan perkata tersebut adalah wajib
7778069 seseungguhnya allah memerintahkan kesempurnaan dalam segala hal karena itu apabila kalian membunuh dalam hukuman qishas sempurnakanlah pembunuhannya apabila kalian menyembelih maka sempurnakanlah sembelihannya
7778070 i would say some people thought we were going to die that is how frightening it was the woman sitting in the seats in front of us was whimpering
7778071 i knew it wasnt an engine problem there was a sudden drop in temperature and a rush of cold air you think to yourself god is there a hole in the aircraft it actually felt like someone had opened a door at the back of the aircraft it was incredibly cold
7778072 the next thing the oxygen masks were dropping my highest priority was to get a mask on to my son who was sitting next to me in a bemused and frightened state we were descending for about five minutes from what i assume was 30 000 or 40 000ft to 8 000ft as we landed we saw fire engines every quarter of a mile down the runway
7778073 mine wasnt filling up with oxygen and neither was my sons
7778074 from where i was sitting i could see about 20 masks and only a few of them were inflating
7778075 it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
7778076 the oxygen masks were working the correct safety procedures were followed
7778077 the first thing we do in these situations is divert to safety take the safety first option
7778078 we have to require that the pilots and the cabin crew also deploy their oxygen masks they cant be making passenger pa announcements when they have their oxygen masks on as the passengers confirmed the pilot did make an announcement once he got down to 8 000ft where it is safe to take the oxygen masks off that they were diverting to limoges
7778079 ryanair confirms that the fr9336 from bristol airport to barcelona girona airport on the evening of august 25 experienced an inflight depressurisation incident which caused the oxygen masks on board to deploy all 168 passengers disembarked safely upon landing a total of 16 passengers together with five accompanying family members have transferred at their request to a local hospital complaining of earache

7778087 it was a hectic scene and we were all kind of winging it
7778088 behind us were hendrix sly and the family stone all these bands and we really wanted to be good in front of them for me the high point was us going out and singing suite judy blue eyes and getting all the way through it and not screwing up it was stoned and funny and fine

7778161 i pulled myself up by my own bootstraps and so can they
7778162 this was exemplified to me a few months ago while in a store
7778163 excuse me he wants to be homeless no one wants to be homeless even though it may appear that way we need to look at experiences such as physical abuse and emotional trauma the man may have encountered that have resulted in his long term homelessness
7778164 while wed like to think that a meal a few bible verses and a place to stay can provide a quick fix for the issue of poverty and homelessness for the most part its not as easy as that
7778165 over the years ive seen much material which attributes homelessness almost purely to a lack of affordable housing while that may be the issue in some cases it is far from universally true
7778166 all well do is take people with seriously debilitating issues
7778167 and give them a place to stay without dealing with the problems that caused their homelessness in the first place
7778168 it is found in a jesus based position and a realization that the lord has called us to be the visible representation of his love here on earth our culture is changed one heart at a time not with the changing of presidents and political parties
7778169 more specifically the solution for our nations burgeoning homeless population is for the homeless to have all of the help and professional services they need but cemented together by a relationship with jesus he is the only one who can give us the ability to successfully face life and navigate the myriad of problems and hurts which we all experience every day

7778189 j hrlich werden in deutschland knapp 40 000 diabetes bedingte amputationen vorgenommen nur die h lfte ist jedoch wirklich notwendig
7778190 in einigen f llen wird bereits nach einem jahr bei diabetespatienten ein fu amputiert obwohl mit etwas geduld und einsatz dieser durchaus zu retten w re
7778191 oftmals k mmern sich in den kliniken internisten um diabetiker die nicht immer das absolute fachwissen um die komplexit t der thematik haben
7778192 einige rzte sind einfach zu ungeduldig und k nnen den heilungsprozess nicht abwarten das ist ein ernsthaftes problem
7778193 der grund daf r d rfte sein dass eine amputation f r die betroffenen der anfang vom ende ist und sie sich innerlich aufgeben
7778194 durch die amputationen sind die patienten nicht mehr in der lage alleine f r sich zu sorgen und landen in der vielzahl in pflegeheimen
7778195 da kann doch kaum noch von einer erleichterung f r die patienten gesprochen werden
7778196 das problem bei diabetikern ist dass sie oftmals gar nicht mitbekommen dass sie eine wunde haben
7778197 dann reicht schon ein nicht bemerktes taschentuch im schuh aus dass sich eine blase unter dem fu bildet und diese kann sich bei nichtbehandlung entz nden
7778198 aus bagatellen kann sich bei diabetikern ganz schnell eine gro e entz ndung entwickeln
7778199 wir trauen uns vielleicht mehr zu als andere kollegen eine fu operation ist f r mich wie in mein wohnzimmer zu gehen

7778219 we think shearing has as much right to be called a sport as any commonwealth or national games event
7778220 shearers should be up there with other australian sporting champions
7778221 some of these guys train for months to be at their physical best theyre going to the gym and doing yoga and following special diets theyre outstanding athletes

7778225 obama has proven hes willing to turn on anyone just to be president hes not black hes biracial and he wasnt even raised by black people barack doesnt embody the values and characteristics we as black people are raised with
7778226 one drop of black blood and youre black the truth is every african american is biracial go back far enough and youll find the massah was in the slave quarters

7778228 biden was trying to be the nominee then if baracks cool with him then i am and joe biden can be the muscle guy
7778229 the stereotype is that all black men are angry that if hes not angry hes not passionate
7778230 i just feel blessed that they asked me to do this when else in your life would you really take all of these amazing dance classes
7778231 i just wasnt sure if i could fly back and forth across the country
7778232 i dont think we need to beg countries to play against us especially during ramadan
7778233 i mean we have international cricket coming up later this year and then there is the series against india early next year
7778234 if afridi wants a ramadan break he can inform the board about it
7778235 in any case we would pick only players who are fully committed to the national team
7778236 we are looking into some of the technical aspects of the case and have sought the assistance of a british sports medicine and doping expert
7778237 we have sent a formal request to the ipl for a hearing in which we have informed them that the tests had also shown traces of different food in the sample as well

7778240 i cannot make the tree blossom when it suits me
7778241 i do believe and the united states believes that the actions and the announcements that are taking place are indeed having a negative effect on the atmosphere for the negotiation and that is not what we want
7778242 we have a lot of work to do between now and then if were going to get it done so i expect an intensification of our efforts
7778243 its clear to everyone that the jewish neighborhoods of jerusalem will remain part of israel in any possible final status agreement

7778249 last year 72 327 patients had operations at united lincolnshire hospitals nhs trust not including emergency operations and we want to reassure patients that the vast majority of operations go ahead without any problems
7778250 i think my view has been all the time that the icc cricket australia and the aca australian cricketers association would make a decision and they have finally done that
7778251 its a tournament australia currently holds so come next year whenever they put it back on we are looking forward to retaining that trophy
7778252 right now i think all the guys are rapt that the icc has made a decision
7778253 we have taken the opportunity to assemble a team of emerging talent and players who will benefit from the experience of touring and playing in australia and india
7778254 the tour is helping to build the experience of these players and is part of a programme to build greater depth at the international level
7778255 it is exciting for all the guys concerned with the test tour coming up in only a months time
7778256 some good performances in this a tour will certainly be looked at by national selectors
7778257 the first tour match is at bangalore where the first test is going to be played and the second tour match is in hyderabad so both will be good opportunities for us to perform well and put our hands up for selection
7778258 the one thing about this tour is that it is about getting the rust out of the system and trying to perform well after a break
7778259 it is a perfect opportunity for us to go out there and just try and get back into playing mode
7778260 it might take a little bit of getting used to but we are lucky that we have got three or four days before the first tour match to acclimatise and train in the nets
7778261 we defended for most of the game and didnt really create any chances

7778270 i think inspiration can be everywhere you just need to look closer for the fusion piece i shaped the 3d shapes in max and placed them in photoshop i wanted a clean line between the 2d and 3d but overall it should fuse together i like to place very massive and static elements and bring them into a flow a friend told me about the design fusion competition because i almost use 2d and 3d elements in my work i had some nice feedback from the community thank you so much
7778271 a few months ago i moved to a village where there were lots of centipedes these things were literally everywhere
7778272 the kitchen the bedroom they were even coming out of the drain in the shower ive been bitten at least three times even during the design fusion challenge so i thought id turn my misfortune into a cool concept i figured this might work well with the cock as a rival now being from the caribbean these are things you will grow up seeing
7778273 i tried my most to keep this deign as minimal as possible but at the same time interesting
7778274 jason lynchs cock and centipede is a striking design the elements and bold colors are as energetic as they are beautiful this image cleverly uses a strong color and negative space to create the foundation that springs to life with perfectly placed 3d elements
7778275 the inspiration came from the day i was taking a ride on my bicycle and was near the place where i buried a pet a turtle named
7778276 it was fun to take two of my biggest passions in one project and also learn from the other competitors and see the main title though the eyes of many artists from other countries

7778283 we could be eroding our tax base into the future
7778284 it seems like its pretty difficult to quantify what the total amount of need might be for the tif district and that also has a bearing on how long it might last
7778285 your generation has done more travel and service work than ours did your generation sees yourselves as citizens of the world
7778286 some may be able to offer longer hours on four days of the week and potentially improve the access to patients

7778320 the fact that you place your bet on red does not mean that the black is not still there
7778321 fortunately i dont think im going to miss too much of the season
7778322 i dont know what exactly the procedure was but they had to go in both sides and fix them
7778323 he told me not to compare this to other injuries because theyre completely different
7778324 both donovan and l j s were a lot more extensive and had a lot more damage i wouldnt expect it to take as long as they took to get back
7778325 but i figured id have the surgery now and get back as soon as possible they havent given me a timetable its kind of see how it feels as you go as time passes well have a better idea when ill be back out there
7778326 i know ive had issues down there since my days in st louis
7778327 its gotten worse over the years i know i started feeling it in training camp about 3 or 4 days into it it started giving me problems and it gradually became harder and harder to get through practice with it after the carolina game it got to a point where it was hard to deal with
7778328 football players youre going to have to play through some pain sometimes
7778329 i underestimated it a little bit i just figured it was one of those things you played through and eventually it got better but it didnt
7778330 i definitely dont want to come back too early and put myself out for more of the season
7778331 im going to be back out there when i know i cant do more damage to it you dont want to lose more time you want to make sure its right i dont know what the magic formula is but ill know when im ready
7778332 when somebody gets hurt we go with the next guy who steps up and plays
7778333 thats just our mentality wed like to have kevin back as quick as possible hes a really good player i think hes a little underrated and hes a good player wed like him back as quick as we can in the meantime we have some pretty good players that will be able to step up and play at a high level
7778334 the fourth defensive tackle is a guy by the name of klecko
7778335 he looks good to me right now he had a good game the other night and hes had a great camp
7778336 ive been hearing that hes a long shot since ive been in the nfl
7778337 they said i was too small to be a nose tackle up in new england
7778338 i just put it out of my mind and go play
7778339 he has good football sense and he loves to play hes a high motor guy im not going to say he hasnt surprised me some im not quite as surprised after being around him a bit
7778340 honestly if you guys had not just told me id have no idea what was said
7778341 ive got to get through this week and then hopefully when the roster for st louis the season opener comes youre name is still there im just going to keep doing what i did to get here keep pushing
7778342 to tell truth id only lost about 10 pounds to go down to fullback
7778343 putting the weight back on wasnt the problem it was eating all that chicken and salad to get it off in the first place
7778344 switching back to tackle was easy you just go back to what you know the only thing was you had to get back in that pass rushing and run stuffing mind set it wasnt a big deal
7778345 i had to learn the whole front seven in new england
7778346 it was just as complicated up there dont get me wrong because im still learning but i think its going ok
7778347 i dont know whats going to happen i would assume that hell probably say no and if thats the case so be it ill get some practice today and tomorrow well be ok
7778348 der klick in die unabh ngigkeit abschied vom planeten google
7778349 its embedded in our history now its part of our dna you cant take that away
7778350 they would be as successful today as they were in their own era because of their ability to adapt not only to their audiences but to the era they were playing in
7778351 they had a very unique ability to integrate themselves into any audience demographic
7778352 it really helps from on high to have somebody that you revere that you care about and want to hear what theyre saying and doing and what theyre wearing everything
7778353 thats important for us whether its an apparition or not
7778354 people are looking back now because were in a very similar situation to 68 an unpopular war an unpopular president whos waging it serious domestic problems
7778355 people ached to feel noble in 1968 and they ache to feel noble again
7778356 people sense theres a similarity between the two periods and it makes the kennedys more interesting to them
7778357 i dont think the american people know them very well
7778358 they do a lot of good humanitarian work but if i was to have to name them i think i would have a hard time
7778359 it is time again for a new generation of leadership it is time now for barack obama
7778360 thats probably the richest resource you have for finding a doctor who will communicate well with people
7778361 the bottom line issue is the level of rapport or the level of confidence that i have with my doctor
7778362 thats a great starting point for any doctor patient relationship
7778363 they took four from us we took four from them that means were even
7778364 i want to face their best in key situations like that because im a competitor and thats what i want
7778365 he got some fastballs and he had short quick swings he stayed on the ball good
7778366 just let the kids play how to stop other adults from ruining your childs fun and success in youth sports
7778367 that big on our back sounds good to me and were ready to get after it
7778368 i think if we dont make it to the acc championship we let some people down
7778369 theres an entire generation of kids who have no idea smu used to be a good football program
7778370 if we recruited a kid to hawaii who was being recruited by a pac 10 school we were probably 1 for 150 on those kids
7778371 here before i even played a football game i had 14 commitments of top high school kids for the 09 season thats the biggest difference
7778372 we want to be no 1 and were going to have to fight for it
7778373 its like going to a mercedes benz dealer and deciding which color you want they all run the same
7778374 where were sitting and everything we can split with the mets and still win our division
7778375 i look at our schedule and everything and id say getting to sept 15 and being close to where we are at gives us a chance
7778376 if we can stay with them we can beat other people too
7778377 but if they dominate us they are going to put some distance between us
7778378 we looked at the blueprint at what weve been doing and made some intelligent decisions without really panicking everybody
7778379 people are expecting penn to be old news and washed up we want them to think that
7778380 to get the swagger back we need to start winning games if you keep losing nobodys going to respect you we came in here expecting to win championships if not the first year the second year if not the second year at some point now our times kind of running out were getting a little antsy you can sense it especially with the older guys
7778381 you just keep plugging away each year everybody comes in with a clean slate i like being the underdog really it just makes us hungrier we want to show people what we can do
7778382 before we spent an awful lot of time making sure they didnt get too confident
7778383 now you have to be really concerned that you build enough confidence its a fragile program from that sense
7778384 we have to get some of the kids buying back into everything believing they can win the tight games thats one reason we went with a whole new approach
7778385 ive been on the ballot a few times but i hope something happens i would just be so honored and happy if it happened i dont know what i would do id be so thrilled
7778386 i wanted to get him in the game and just kind of work him in
7778387 he felt like he was getting his timing and everything
7778388 my approach was swing at anything and everything that was around the plate and i did
7778389 i was told all along that if something were to happen that this is a position i could find myself in
7778390 i am ready to step in there and hopefully there wont be a letdown at all
7778391 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
7778392 this shawn michaels chris jericho feud is borderline unwatchable i get it they hate each other just fight already
7778393 its becoming time to give some credit to the in ring efforts of mark henry
7778394 this is the worst wrestling show i have seen in a long time with booking that defies all logic and common sense
7778395 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7778396 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7778397 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7778398 who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and our sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher

7778405 then in november i expect to vote for the democratic party nominee because i am a good democrat
7778406 i really only know one person in new mexico who has said he will not vote for obama
7778407 disappointed that obama didnt pick hillary as his running mate
7778408 i have been a friend of hillarys for a very long time i joined her fan club four years ago i will vote for hillary here this week and then i will support obama i dont want to but i will i dont think he has been very respectful to hillary

7778416 by doing away with the old grading system zc seeks to encourage teamwork rather than individualism and the new system should bring about a unity of purpose that would otherwise not be possible in the old order
7778417 but players will still be evaluated taking into account their old status with zc as of last season and they will be under contract for the next two years
7778418 walter has been asked to choose his assistant and he has indicated that he would like to work with douglas hondo and zc are in the process of trying to engage the former player at his england base
7778419 the two of them were in australia recently under a zc development programme at cricket australias centre of excellence in adelaide
7778420 to make a decision today will not be good and undemocratic for us
7778421 to make a community wide effort to engage brandeis in the electoral process
7778422 hazelden is no different than any other kind of health care provider and beset with the same troubles other health care providers face in a troubled economy
7778423 mark is a tremendous advocate for those seeking treatment for addiction and is committed to helping people from all walks of life battle this disease
7778424 it was getting so bad that mom was directing him
7778425 i said if dad doesnt stop driving im going to call the state troopers and report him because i didnt want to see him kill someone
7778426 the driving conversation is often the beginning of many conversations
7778427 i think driving impairment does not happen suddenly its usually a gradual decline
7778428 we want to be on our own for as long as possible and the driving conversation is the tip of the iceberg
7778429 in america we are a culture on the move driving is something we see as an entitlement
7778430 i could still drive but i dont opt to i guess
7778431 its so nice i dont have to park i just get out of the car and come in its much better
7778432 it got to the point where he shouldnt drive anymore and he was determined to drive
7778433 so we had the state retest him and he failed it
7778434 pretty much almost everyone at some point will have to hand in their keys
7778435 if you plan ahead of time its usually not as devastating as people think it is
7778436 i think it gives them more things to assist them so that they can be on the road longer and safer
7778437 they know when they no longer can drive in bad weather or at night
7778438 many people have been driving for so many years that a lot has changed since the time they were first licensed
7778439 talking with older drivers a guide for family and friends
7778440 well i cant stand that no way oh god id go insane thanks
7778441 you know maria i ask the question in the interview about how you do under pressure and i know you said you step up and are assertive but i am extremely impressed with how well you did i mean we basically threw you into the fire this week and you really shined
7778442 god she is so particular and demanding i dont know why we have to do this or that and i never do this who cares
7778443 maria hey over here now you tell me if im doing this right ok
7778444 probiotics are live microorganisms that have been shown to have a beneficial health effect
7778445 but not all live microorganisms are probiotic because in order to be officially be called probiotic it needs to have undergone some type of clinical research to document their health effect
7778446 it is really tempting to make statements that probiotics can help with irritable bowel syndrome symptoms and antibiotic associated diarrhea but what people have to be careful about is some of these products of probiotics have been tested in only these specific areas
7778447 so people just cant go to the grocery store or the health food store and buy anything that says live cultures or probiotics on them and expect necessarily to have the same effect
7778448 although its early some influenza vaccine already is beginning to trickle into the state
7778449 thats earlier than normal unusually early for any flu vaccine to be available
7778450 we must not forget that anyone can get the flu it might not kill you but if you take it home to your babies or to your grandparents it might kill them
7778451 i was thinking i could cut off the run at home plate to protect that shutout
7778452 when he takes the mound hes throwing filthy filthy stuff
7778453 six rbis a couple of homers i think its the right time
7778454 shane on first 10 foot lead posada knows shane hook slides so hes gonna throw to the inside part of the base
7778455 shane goes posada throws umpire calls him out bang here come 12 different replays and they all show shanes hook slide avoided the tag they dont reverse the call yankees win the game
7778456 they say it will slow down the games it takes 2 seconds to re rack the tape you know what slows down games lou piniella going out there to argue for 4 minutes kicking dirt
7778457 and van brocklin would throw it and mcdonald wasnt there and van brocklin would get really hissed
7778458 mcdonald had tripped i could see that on my monitors in the truck but the fan watching at home didnt know that i wanted the fan to see what i saw
7778459 took it back to new york somebody erased it or taped over it which is what happened to the first super bowl which i directed
7778460 no royalties because i was an employee at cbs and no emmy i dont know why maybe it was an anti italian backlash
7778461 called the truck and said my boy what you have done here will have such far reaching implications we cant begin to imagine them today
7778462 he had to do everything had to shoot the biggest water buffalo but he couldnt have invented instant replay because he was never in the truck he never directed he never punched the buttons
7778463 tony verna son of italian immigrants invented the instant replay
7778464 because it changed something that had never been done before
7778465 lots of schools have balances they are not spending on every day activity it is something we are very concerned about because the money is there for the childrens education and should not be kept back
7778466 we clawed back two per cent last year and we are looking to do more this year to stop too much being carried forward we will warn them in advance and if it continues we will reclaim the money
7778467 hard pressed taxpayers funding local schools want to see their money spent providing children with a quality education not piling up in school bank accounts
7778468 the argument is if you have money allocated you should spent it on the children now not save it up
7778469 if they cant spend it it should be allocated to other schools that are struggling with their budgets
7778470 its an awful lot of money that should be being spent on children
7778471 we believe that post games and for a long period of time these venues will be used pretty well
7778472 the management companies will immediately open them up for public use
7778473 hur lyckades jag somna och s b rjade han le

7778475 its very hard not to think about the olympic games
7778476 very difficult to refocus i mean all my thinking is there in beijing
7778477 these threshold values let you decide how paranoid you want to be about accepting keys
7778478 in both cases higher values are more secure but also run the risk of incorrectly determining that a key is invalid
7778479 when firefox users click on a web site that uses a self signed certificate they get a security error message that leaves many people bewildered
7778480 unable to verify the identity of xyz com as a trusted site
7778481 its very very very easy for someone to convince you to go through their computer
7778482 a lot of people wouldnt even know theyve been attacked
7778483 absence of frc is an indicator that the water might be contaminated with pathogens there is an increase in the cases of water born diseases during the last few months
7778484 if we could prevent these infections in the first place or detect them sooner we might one day be able to prevent some of these premature births
7778485 urbanisation and industrialisation in heavily populated countries like china and india and these economies continue to grow strongly
7778486 while the equity markets are currently focused on downside risks we believe there are potential offsets on the upside based on continued strength in commodity demand low inventory levels and a supply side which continues to face multiple constraints
7778487 the groups performance in the first half together with our growth potential supports the boards view that rio tinto presents a very strong standalone value proposition for shareholders
7778488 rio tinto is in great shape and is getting stronger
7778489 concentrated on the us and the uk because we see value
7778490 we are not highly geared and can ride through the storms
7778491 it may be premature to say that we have a global profile but thats the direction we want to move
7778492 the toughest period of trading bovis has experienced in its time as a public company
7778493 the group anticipates private home sales volumes continuing at the current absolute level for the remainder of 2008
7778494 i can look you in the eyes and tell you everything is on track
7778495 and i want to be very careful about releasing the most reliable and pertinent information related to this online gaming issue possible
7778496 chappell albini inc has been very helpful to our community
7778497 they went out of their way to help our annual food drive holiday collections and publicity were very thankful and offer our pledge of support for any future generous projects
7778498 as soon as our paper hit the presses i put the stories on all major wires
7778499 and response from beyond was instantaneous phone calls from various high volume news agencies rained in seeking further coverage and dibbs on the rest of the online gaming story
7778500 i thought all those rumors were just rumors but now i see that there is some truth to them after all
7778501 i knew it all along everyone told me my thoughts about the online gaming news stories were hyped up but now we all see that i was right on kudos to reporter trudy milovich for an excellent piece
7778502 im happy to finally find out the truth about what goes on when it comes to online gaming affairs
7778503 ive always been weary of the online gaming industry and its operations but finally we now have the truth
7778504 after my stint with the daily news i moved over to investigative reporting
7778505 and i found my home i love investigative journalism particularly in the online gaming industry where there is always a juicy story to be told furthermore it is of great benefit to our community to report such news
7778506 i have worked numerous leads for online gaming stories for years now
7778507 and cultured a vast quantity of insiders to feed me information with all these sources our paper will finally have the chance to write the best review possible complete with valid information and up to the minute reporting
7778508 various reporters covering the recent online gaming story gathered around its central figure iden housley who initially leaked the news to the press
7778509 we have spent so many resources trying to create reliable rng software using traditional algorithms and caculi theorems but have never really analyzed geometric proofs and associated logic as a means to perfect our efforts
7778510 in general spatial relationships are not trypically meant for use in random numbers
7778511 but were trying new things now that could yield very promising results
7778512 were hoping to try our new spatial studies this spring with
7778513 in the past weve worked hard with many sportsbooks but now realize our strengths are found in the digital gaming sector with specific success with online casinos as the year continues to progress well be sure to keep ahead of all new advancements
7778514 i can look you in the eyes and tell you everything is on track
7778515 nicht nur f r die familie da ist sondern auch eigene w nsche interessen durchsetzen
7778516 samsung mobile charging stations are designed to give travelers an easy way to keep their phones laptops and other gadgets charged while on the go
7778517 with the summer travel season in full swing we expect the charging stations to be a big a hit at one of nations busiest airports newark liberty international
7778518 it would mean a lot to our players our program and our department
7778519 making the ncaas is definitely a goal for us since we have so many veterans returning
7778520 we are mad about last seasons performance against carnegie mellon and are ready to come out and reverse the outcome of that game
7778521 our players knowing that we were that close last year know what it takes and they are hungry for it
7778522 trees was a defensive player so we have all of our girls working hard on defense so they dont have to get subbed out on the back row
7778523 she is a versatile player who is expected to compete for an outside hitting spot
7778524 we have no set positions so everyone is fighting hard for their spot on the team
7778525 we really hate our government weve hated them off and on mostly on for a long long time
7778526 the water didnt just come into the threshold it came in and flooded the entire shop then it came into and flooded the actual stage and completely ruined the stage
7778527 the threshold was completely replaced and as soon as the facilities staff did that there werent any more problems but unless they change the drainage system there are no guarantees for future damage
7778528 were basically just having casual conversations right now about how we can look at things a bit differently
7778529 the weather stripping on the shop door had worn away and was on schedule to get replaced but because we had such a wet summer the ground was saturated and the water didnt have anywhere else to go
7778530 i think well be ahead of the game this year
7778531 well be better prepared just because weve been together longer im pleased so far the boys are working hard and are in good shape theres a tremendous amount of enthusiasm
7778532 our returning players are dedicated to having a wonderful year and were very strong in general
7778533 theyve worked hard all year and we have great captains and great leaders im enthusiastic and optimistic
7778534 the major component of my campaign is seeing that i am a sensible alternative to someone who is so out of touch
7778535 brandeis was extraordinarily influential to me as an institution that influenced my politics and my ethics
7778536 the ideas really are just the components of a fit soccer player
7778537 the fitness components were put together with a weight training program a sprint workout and some agility workout its really just all the components of what it takes to compete in a soccer match
7778538 we only lost a few starters from last year and our freshmen really stepped up last year and i really think that were probably going to have a good incoming class
7778539 so i think were ready to make the ncaa tournament and i think we know after last year what it takes to get to ncaas and how much harder we have to push ourselves
7778540 i hope everybody has good chemistry on the team and that we just start where we ended last year because we ended on a really good note
7778541 we are re launching the committee within the next couple of days
7778542 we didnt have as broad a search as we hoped we could
7778543 last year we had three students all of whom were jewish
7778544 most of the public safety officers have gone through training
7778545 not necessarily good or bad it provides a more secure situation
7778546 i think it will initially get the information out there so at least people are in tune to where a situation has happened and what is happening
7778547 in cross country its huge to have a year under your belt
7778548 we expect to see a pretty big jump in pretty much all our sophomores from what they did last year its very difficult to step right in as a freshman in cross country
7778549 i think this year we definitely have the numbers to be a very solid team
7778550 i think clearly gendebos ability would augment that but i think our approach has definitely been moreso to look at the team as the sum of the parts and try to communicate well and get everyone on the same page so that everyone is performing strongly and we can have different people pick up the team at different meets
7778551 stone and matt jennings 09 have really led the team throughout the summer
7778552 everyones trained significantly harder than they have in the past we have a shot at a national ranking this year
7778553 the matter had been blown out of proportion and that resolution without involving the criminal justice system was the most appropriate solution
7778554 i do not expect any further legal action taken toward ortner
7778555 the student may accept responsibility and choose administrative action or may accept or deny responsibility and request a hearing before the university board on student conduct
7778556 i think that on some levels they must have been considering the idea too
7778557 after speaking with university administrators about dining hours it was decided that we should extend the hours to better meet the needs lifestyles and schedules of students
7778558 centro presente hasnt reached out to us to reschedule the concert as far as i know but were certainly happy to work with them when theyre prepared to hold another event
7778559 do thing that are important and significant in the world
7778560 education is extremely important and its the future of the country
7778561 the cost of private higher education is prohibitive for most families
7778562 brandeis must raise more funds to remain need blind and continue to help the best students obtain a brandeis education
7778563 i left because this was a tremendous opportunity that doesnt come around a whole lot
7778564 its not great opening without him but we have every belief that we will be able to replace him adequately
7778565 if the pool was not very good we would consider stopping and restarting at the start of the second semester
7778566 more items available from a grab and go hot food bar to more produce and organics to fountain beverages and espresso coffee
7778567 as part of the c meal program developed through a collaborative effort of dining services the dining committee and university administration
7778568 the idea of adding a national brand sub concept and a larger convenience store originated five years ago through discussions with aramark students and administration
7778569 the concept of the suite release was inspired by the observation that the youth of the ipod generation no longer buy or listen to entire albums they listen to playlists they grab their favorite three to four songs from a particular album add those to a playlist and then discard the rest of the album like yesterdays news

7778571 insulting god religion is a freedom of speech as your country did then allow me to show you my freedom knowledge of hacking
7778572 in the beginning when we launched the initiative there was an effort to create awareness around the world that we are the center of the animal health industry
7778573 now we are influencing the industry we are creating programs and initiatives in our region that make it the best place for animal health companies
7778574 it is important to have the established companies take note of the corridor
7778575 it is equally important to have the early stage new technology and leaders of tomorrow also looking to the corridor
7778576 there is not a lot of new technology in the pipeline
7778577 all the companies are short of new products to bring to market
7778578 as the economy worsens employers are having a harder time affording insurance for their employees theyre increasing the patient portion and patients benefits actually decrease
7778579 here i am a person whos worked his entire life paid his bills does the right thing has insurance and i cant get a procedure that i need done
7778580 we feel that this is more of an issue with an insurance company
7778581 employers are either cutting back on the benefits that they offer employees or asking employees to contribute a bigger stake in their health care
7778582 somebody facing a catastrophic illness and having to be burdened with the extra stress of paying a co pay or premium is just unconscionable
7778583 we have a number of visitors who use our services who tend to be out of town residents or out of country residents and then leave
7778584 they would like bon secours to have a larger presence in the community as in a larger hospital
7778585 were meeting more of what the states asking us to do
7778586 we need to provide great care so you want to come this hospital
7778587 although not experts on the whole of england waterstones staff will be able to provide visitors with basic yet essential information and point visitors to tics local tourist information centres to take advantage of their more detailed knowledge
7778588 waterstones was selected as a partner by visitbritain because of the quality of our booksellers who are often very knowledgeable about a wide range of topics including their local area
7778589 this is an ideal opportunity to attract more customers into our branches while positioning waterstones at the heart of the local community

7778594 i regret that we have failed in the democratic journey we started with my late wife benazir bhutto and nawaz sharif we had some successes together we elected a prime minister and defeated a dictator
7778595 it is unfortunate that he sharif has refused to travel with us in the coming journey
7778596 the sustainability programs focus areas include but are not limited to energy and water conservation waste minimization recycling sustainable building and landscape design student faculty and staff commuting and procurement of green products
7778597 when i started we had the opportunity to switch to single stream recycling with this type of recycling the recycling does not have to be sorted between paper and cans and bottles it can all just be put together
7778598 the recycling is incredibly cheaper than throwing stuff away so the university is very committed in fact it costs 80 percent less per ton to recycle than it does to throw things away
7778599 i am pleased to say that darwish was able to reach his goal of completing the typ many people from various parts of the university worked hard to make this happen i and darwishs typ instructors were in close touch with him over the summer working on this
7778600 all other details of darwish s application and outcomes of it are his to tell
7778601 all right well im going to take some time write a screenplay and then move to new york

7778603 the fact that you place your bet on red does not mean that the black is not still there
7778604 when you have an olympic medal people are drawn to you
7778605 its like a fantasy world where everythings free and everyone wants your autograph eventually im going to have to go back to the real world but for now im enjoying the ride
7778606 we came so close in 2004 and you have to wait four years to get another shot so to actually come through by one point this time is the most unbelievable feeling in the world
7778607 sometimes he won his bout sometimes he lost but the score was always close
7778608 he never got blown away so obviously thats a big contribution sometimes he was very much on the positive side
7778609 i think i utilized more emotional energy than actual energy fencing
7778610 if i can come from a division iii school and win a silver medal in the olympics there isnt anything you cant do with a brandeis education that you set your mind to do
7778611 there was a time when our country was known as a world leader in art and culture america was defined by the music of leonard bernstein the painting of jackson pollock the dance of martha graham and the plays of arthur miller
7778612 ill probably end up doing 50 i would like to find a permanent home
7778613 after discussing options with the family it was agreed that we would offer this and the defendant accepted the offer
7778614 the company also did not pass along to policyholders the savings it should have realized based on purchasing cheaper reinsurance
7778615 we are disappointed with the commissioners decision we will review all our options and take the best course aimed at protecting our florida policyholders

7778629 i think overall the trend of the market is bearish right now but the hurricane premium as well as the russia nato premium is whats keeping the market from dropping further
7778630 the central bank was in the market at p45 88 and p45 98 per dollar and now they are defending p46
7778631 i think theres still demand for dollars the market would rather hold dollar than peso
7778632 if we cannot stop their desire to protect their communities then we might as well channel their vigilance into something that is legal and organized
7778633 and they fight best if it is for friends and family
7778634 this is better than outright cash dole out its basically a food for work scheme since most of them are farmers they would need money to plant again but instead of using what little savings they have as a down payment for a paltik they can get guns training and pay from the government
7778635 mass distribution of guns to civilians without the corresponding training or organization that would impose accountability and discipline is a scheme that would backfire

7778642 i have known luke was not into women for a long time that he preferred men and because i suspected this i tried to make it easier for him to be open about it
7778643 if i had forced the issue and not allowed him to come to me then i would have been seen as judging which i wasnt if i had brought up the question of his sexuality i may have also put him in a box which i did not want to do i wanted to see how he evolved and how he transformed into his true self all i could do through it all was just be there listen and continue to show that i was never judging only loving of who he is and that it made no difference whether he liked boys or girls
7778644 luke is luke he is my son and i love him for who he is he is a part of me he will only disappoint me when he is not true to himself only then will i be upset

7778658 many star athletes were making less than 100 000 before herbert started marketing ali even jim brown i think was making around 80 000 at the time
7778659 then there was more than a couple where he splattered just a little bit

7778661 this is my first week practicing there itd be like looking at the team after a week of training camp you dont expect the team to be perfect at that point but you expect them to be making improvement toward what you want them to be
7778662 i dont feel completely comfortable but im getting more comfortable every day i feel like im making real improvement every day
7778663 im going to do everything you ask me to do go as hard as i possibly can but the fact is its not going to be perfect right now theres still things i need to work on

7778668 the flanker spot is built for a guy like him as far as the basic routes and adjustments

7778674 they are the most affluent lot among real estate buyers in india showing interest in buying large chunks of land in their home country they are not affected by the current slowdown as they take a long range view of the whole scenario they have faith in the domestic economy and firmly believe that the prices will appreciate by at least 10 to 15 percent every year they see the downturn as an opportunity to invest in large chunks of land or even developed areas which they get at a good discount from even the top developers
7778675 according to our assessment the interest from nris has increased almost by 20 25 percent every quarter which is almost two to two anda half times in the last two to three years interestingly not just investors from the gulf countries but even from uk and usa have shown interest
7778676 many nris in the us and uk are not as confident as before of sanctity of their employment while others are disturbed by negative economic patterns across developed countries they see greater potential for india overcoming the current economic setbacks sentimental attachment to their country of origin is another reason
7778677 the gulf nri is one who is bound to return nris are looking for decent returns and might think of holding property here while investors from uk and us are pure investors nris mostly have an affinity to the areas they come from
7778678 it appears that the parents of a newborn at risk of contracting hepatitis b have not presented their baby for medical treatment

7778684 the easiest way to restore normalcy is for prime minister samak to quit
7778685 if we do not receive a clear and positive response we will prolong the rally to the next day and mobilize more protesters
7778686 wait for the prime minister so far there is no special instruction
7778687 how can we do what were doing for others better
7778688 most people fall in love with their product or their company instead of falling in love with their client
7778689 if you cant honest to god fall in love with your client youre in the wrong business or you dont appreciate your business or you dont appreciate your own worth
7778690 you should be asking what do i have to give
7778691 see yourself as becoming an agent of change a creator of value a value contributor
7778692 making your first million a practical guide to principle centered prosperity
7778693 we believe the judge recognized shermans extremely minimal role in bronders scheme
7778694 im not ready to judge yet there are a lot of politics that come into play on a small island like that
7778695 i hope the allegations arent true hes very respected in his industry and his record of accomplishment speaks for itself
7778696 hes just a completely driven extremely talented person and thats why this is so baffling
7778697 we did our homework on him and everywhere hes ever worked had this same glowing report about what he had done
7778698 you look at his great story how he built himself up from a small town in texas and you cant help but be impressed but now you start wondering how much of it is true you just dont know what to believe
7778699 the rain destroyed my sons room because of all the mildew that built up in there
7778700 for a long time he had to sleep with me but not anymore
7778701 when i first got the call that we were getting a new home me and my wife got so excited that we started packing right away

7778703 there are 31 mobile home parks in davie and about 22 000 people live in those parks which is almost a quarter of the towns population
7778704 a lot of these people were adversely affected by this storm
7778705 all of the units have been checked for formaldehyde and there is no problem with them
7778706 its a blessing i still cant believe it i dont even have any furniture and here it is that i already have furniture in my new home all i have right now is a small table set im sleeping in a roll away bed and its really nothing to sleep on and now i have a mattress
7778707 its a sturdy house the only difference between the mobile home and regular home is that these mobile homes are brought in on wheels
7778708 all we have are hard choices and not many options
7778709 theres going to be loud conversation this fall and real screaming in 2009 unless there is real relief
7778710 or one by one were going to be toppling over the edge of the cliff
7778711 weve gone all around the state listening and weve heard a lot about rising costs
7778712 my sense is that my committee gets it and well be looking at ways to provide funds
7778713 basically the same money we all had two years ago is the same money well have next year only things dont cost the same
7778714 the goal of this change was to cut taxes so its frustrating that the legislature is pushing us to raise taxes
7778715 when the majority gets back to 1 17 were right back where we started
7778716 i know theyre hurting just like the private sector is hurting
7778717 right now we have it a lot better than other states things could be worse we could have decreasing property values like california
7778718 its not like school districts expect there to be a santa claus but i think there might be more optimism that is warranted
7778719 in the back of your mind youve got to think what if they dont fix school finance what if this continues
7778720 theyve put the entire burden of balancing the state budget on health care providers
7778721 nimeni cu bun sim nu se poate a tepta s coopereze cu rusia ntr o parte a lumii n timp ce ac ioneaz mpotriva sa n alt parte

7778731 our principal asked us what do you need the most we said we needed time to use the tools we already have
7778732 its about making connections and working with what you already have our principal trusted us and allowed us to take that risk
7778733 you wont know about a technology until you start using it just go and do it
7778734 we cant wait until every condition is met to get started with technology
7778735 you have to jump in with what you have but at the same time the community needs to keep working on getting equitable access building a vision advocating for professional development funding and meeting the other essential conditions
7778736 a common language about student learning and has accelerated our use of instructional technology
7778737 you cant do that if teachers are working in isolation behind closed doors
7778738 create rituals have teachers bring examples of something cool that their kids have done build a community of practice get teachers more comfortable talking together it doesnt cost anything yet this seems to be hard for schools to do
7778739 find someone to learn with a study group or buddy in your own building or in another school
7778740 take a unit you love and talk about how you can infuse technology to enhance learning and go even deeper
7778741 show them something thats immediately accessible it needs to fit their objectives so that it validates and enhances what they are already doing
7778742 you want to start with something familiar and close to what they are already doing but so different that it can be a portal to new possibilities its about paradigm shifting
7778743 find some that relate to what you are already teaching
7778744 weve been trying to talk teachers into integrating technology into the classroom for thirty maybe forty years its not working
7778745 can we teach students to help teachers use technology more effectively in the classroom weve got twelve years of data that says we can
7778746 say to kids here are the things we imagine could happen with this technology
7778747 you should let people see the evidence that its working
7778748 when you rely on textbooks what youre actually doing is taking someone elses opinion for granted instead of developing your own
7778749 there is no reason even beginning in third and fourth grade that you cant have kids seek out and find scholarly works newspaper accounts or original documentation for any point in history or for any scientific study
7778750 many children who use the web every day dont have a clue how it works
7778751 like reading and writing web literacy ought to be embedded in every discipline
7778752 in class you let the researchers freewheel they pay attention to the degree that they need to
7778753 the teacher stops being the only educator in the room you end up with a true collaborative learning environment
7778754 but umno will play dirty tricks they are very quiet this time and that is dan ge rous they are quietly going into kampungs to buy votes

7778760 i may not be highly educated but i will never support umno i live by working hard
7778761 we support pas and when a pas candidate did not contest we voted for dap
7778762 i have never seen a by election that is as militant aggressive and violent as this one
7778763 i had a premonition dsai will win with a majority of 27366 votes
7778764 well if he anwar does not perform we will kick him out
7778765 is it the last hurrah for the man who thinks hes the alpha and omega of politicians
7778766 this is democracy ppl clearly reject anwar large turnout in ceramah does not mean ppl will chose him
7778767 the point is a change in governance is imperative now a new hope for a truly malaysian malaysia

7778804 bij grotere parkeergarages zie je dat het parkeersysteem geen rekening houdt met plotseling vrijgekomen plekken

7778868 in the first half the passion and tempo wasnt there while the work rate certainly wasnt there
7778869 we deserved to be 1 0 down at half time but in the second half we should have got something out of the game
7778870 the work rate was good and the tempo was up but if you dont do that for 90 minutes then you are going to get beaten
7778871 the discussions last week were robust and constructive and we look forward to continuing this dialogue around a revised draft exemption text at next months meeting
7778872 around 50 amendments have been proposed to the original text with many countries speaking in favour of amendments
7778873 the key function of the nsg is to formulate guidelines for managing exports of nuclear material equipment and technology to ensure that this trade does not contribute to nuclear weapons proliferation
7778874 discussions in vienna focused on how to ensure compatibility of these objectives with the exemptions sought for the us india civil nuclear co operation agreement
7778875 while new zealand remains a strong advocate of the nuclear non proliferation treaty and the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty and would welcome indias accession to these treaties we have not included these elements in our package of proposals
7778876 new zealand engaged constructively in the discussions acknowledging potential benefits involved in the agreement and its good relationship with both countries while noting concerns and the need for consistency in pursuing the objective of non proliferation
7778877 a large number of countries big and small expressed views similar to new zealands that there needed to be compatibility between the us india agreement and the goals of the nsg and indicated a willingness to engage positively to achieve that outcome
7778878 i think its no secret and i have said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think that settlement activity is helpful
7778879 in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7778880 the peace process is not and should not be affected by any kind of settlement activities
7778881 i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together

7778919 a coroner has called for stricter laws controlling the breeding and distribution of dangerous dogs after a 13 month old boy was mauled to death by his grandparents rottweiler
7778920 we have seen lots of people taking their dogs for a walk since the establishment of the designated area and we have been inundated by phone calls from happy pet owners thanking and congratulating us for this initiative

7778926 that omission sends a message that verges on the sinister not that ministers have abandoned their commitment to decency and fairness but that when it comes to devising strategies for dealing with the numbers crisis and the other challenges facing the prison estate the monitoring task has simply disappeared off the agenda
7778927 we are concerned that the government seems to be going back on jack straws own statement that we cannot build ourselves out of the prison numbers crisis
7778928 we are not just dealing with overcrowding though overcrowding is a serious problem in some prisons we are also dealing with a system that is overwhelmed by numbers

7778932 whilst thousands of people came to join in with the fun and spectacle of carnival once again the event ended with a small minority of people determined to fight and cause trouble
7778933 for over two hours our officers were faced with a hardcore mainly of young men who came to the carnival not to enjoy the event but to fight commit
7778934 officers had to work hard and deliver a strong interventionist style of policing late into the night to make sure that these criminals were not allowed to take over the streets of notting hill this is not the way anyone can want to see the carnival finish
7778935 through our stop and search use of screening wands and seizures of dangerous dogs we sent a clear message that the carnival is no place for such behaviour as this

7778977 it looks like those who have played all summer and are going off to the stanford challenge then the one day series in india will be told to have two or three weeks off england feel they need that
7778978 but i would be very disappointed if that applied to steve harmison hes keen to come back to us after the oneday series against south africa
7778979 it hasnt been confirmed yet that shivnarine chanderpaul will be with us right until the end of the season but he wants to stay and that would certainly help
7778980 the net was fine and well have another knock before making any decisions
7778981 the pitch for the match looks clubby a bit soft and spongy it wont get any better during the game but hopefully it will be the same for both teams so the toss wont be too vital
7778982 im delighted to welcome such a diverse group of member companies

7778999 we cannot chase them away just like that they were helpful during the peoples war and now we cannot just ditch them
7779000 there is no pressure on us because no one expects us to win
7779001 no one gives us any chance and obviously there are a few teams that think they should be in our spot but we have managed to secure a spot and just have to take advantage of that now
7779002 we have dug ourselves out of holes before and we have the finals to look forward to
7779003 there are eight other teams that wont be playing in a weeks time if we can recapture some form and a bit of confidence then there is plenty to look forward to
7779004 we are just going to back ourselves and make sure we dont fracture as a group and really work hard on the training track thats the way you work out of a bad patch
7779005 we have just got to make sure that we really attack the game come out with confidence back ourselves and obviously start well
7779006 we will need to shore up our defence put more pressure on as a midfield group and also better deliver to our forwards
7779007 there is a lot of areas that we need to work on it will be tough to do it in two weeks and this week alone but we will be doing everything we can on the training track to work through that
7779008 as the us side failed to keep its own side of the agreement we cannot but take the following measures under the principle of action for action
7779009 firstly weve decided to stop the denuclearisation process that has been underway in accordance with the october 3 agreement this measure already took effect on august 14 and relevant parties have already been informed
7779010 secondly we will consider restoring the yongbyon facilities to their original state in accordance with strong demands from our relevant agencies
7779011 business confidence will continue to decline said andreas speer an economist at bayerische landesbank in munich
7779012 were in the middle of a slowdown with a high risk of a recession
7779013 the further development in business confidence will hinge on oil prices said sylvain broyer an economist at natixis in frankfurt we may escape a recession in 2008 but the threat for next year is still significant
7779014 indicators will allow purchasers of health services both government and insurers to legitimately distinguish between effective providers of health care and less effective providers
7779015 this should further lower government and insurers costs to everyones benefit
7779016 this would allow private health insurers to make the choices for you
7779017 your private health insurance fund will tell you who you can see and which hospital you should go to and there will be waiting lists for treatment
7779018 by enabling comparisons you encourage competition and innovation and allow the results to be measured
7779019 if a private hospital is achieving outcomes that far exceed the mean we will be able to burrow into the why when previously we havent even been aware of the what

7779034 we will ban by legislation the mining of uranium in western australia and instead we will drive 100 per cent renewable energy production
7779035 uranium is in demand around the world because it offers a prospect of affordable reliable clean energy
7779036 how silly of us not to be part of that growth how silly of us or how silly of alan carpenter to deny developing countries reliable electricity for health education and potable water
7779037 our industry can take a long term view of this

7779057 you are always going to find something you need to work on
7779058 we have to work on social studies in our middle school calling eighth grade social studies
7779059 we try to make the kids have ownership of their scores and let them know that they are responsible in part for their learning and their futures and i think we have done a good job getting that across
7779060 we had some good results in some areas and some areas we have to look at to improve
7779061 weve got some areas in fifth grade and eighth grade were going to need to address
7779062 weve done things like reduce class size in the elementary school and we think that will have a positive impact on our test scores in the future
7779063 but the scores give us some room to improve most notably in fifth and eighth grade social studies
7779064 those have been low across the state so that tells us something about the reliability of the test but that doesnt mean we wont work on it
7779065 even though the new value added measure adds an additional layer of complexity to ohios accountability process it provides a sharper lens for identifying schools where students are making progress
7779066 prior to value added the accountability system measured the percentage of students that reached proficiency not how much progress was made since to the prior year
7779067 the districts report card shows that student performance is improved over last year and reflects the districts academic focus
7779068 we met it in every single subgroup for reading and math
7779069 we feel like our teachers and students are working hard in our effort to improve our report card score
7779070 the 25 out of 30 is something we are going to continue to work at and build upon
7779071 we clearly have to focus more of our energies on our students with special needs and students who are economically disadvantaged
7779072 the 25 out of 30 alone would make us an effective district we just need to make sure that students in all of the categories are improving at the same rate

7779079 its just so gratifying to have this many people here and they look forward to it we start getting calls very early there was one person who called and changed their vacation so they could come
7779080 the biggest thing about this illness is that there is a lot of fear and worry and i think anything you can do to reduce that and make you forget it for even a short period of time is a benefit to anybody
7779081 it gives them a better outlook that theres more than just illness to look forward to
7779082 one of the worries about being ill is that youre alone and this only happens to you when you see other people who have been ill with the same problems whove survived and have succeeded at moving on and accomplishing things thats very important for people to see
7779083 the landscape of cancer therapy has changed dramatically in the last 15 20 years whereas we had very little to offer patients when i first came into practice 25 years ago things medically have developed so fast that we have more people living longer
7779084 cancer instead of becoming a lethal disease is turning into a curable or manageable illness where patients can maintain a good quality of life for many years this gives us a lot of inspiration to have folks here and to interact with them on a totally different level this is such a good tradition to be part of

7779090 mike rose has been working on this project for a long time and would really like to do it but because we hold this property in public trust we need to see if anybody else out there wants to talk and find out whos the best redevelopment partner for the city
7779091 we believe the highest and best use of the property is with a new building
7779092 but if someone says they can fix it up more power to them
7779093 were looking at state federal or possibly some regional money available to us to tear down the building
7779094 as long as we can get outside funds to demolish the building its ok
7779095 lets say the county says it wants the building to be law offices to support the courthouse
7779096 to me this building could be used in many different ways and i wont want to restrict its use to just retail
7779097 when you consider what the best use is for the city the second and third floors as residential is very good in my mind because youre building a population that will utilize the downtown with offices people are here from 8 to 5 then they go home
7779098 they just know how to play the game better its not always hitting it harder its playing smart tennis and learning to pick and choose their spots

7779101 today she pounded the ball in there she was on
7779102 tessas been our no 1 for a couple of years and she feels very comfortable in that spot
7779103 half of the game is mental and generally when something isnt working she can figure something else out
7779104 as for us we have our days were getting better we just need to hit more balls at practice
7779105 they have to learn all the shots and to hit from various spots on the court and in doubles you need to be comfortable with your partner
7779106 i am finding some good combinations though and their personalities match
7779107 we worked hard all summer and now we get to put it to use

7779118 that omission sends a message that verges on the sinister not that ministers have abandoned their commitment to decency and fairness but that when it comes to devising strategies for dealing with the numbers crisis and the other challenges facing the prison estate the monitoring task has simply disappeared off the agenda
7779119 we are concerned that the government seems to be going back on jack straws own statement that we cannot build ourselves out of the prison numbers crisis

7779134 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7779135 will continue to stand with the people of georgia and their democracy and to support its sovereignty and territorial integrity
7779136 i dont think any georgian government can accept losing those territories
7779137 absolutely in the future this is a recipe for future clashes if it is accepted by the russian government sooner or later the fighting will re erupt
7779138 recognition by russia of the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia is the necessary condition for ensuring the security of these peoples
7779139 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever be one state with georgia again
7779140 the people of south ossetia and abkhazia have made their choice in life and they have made up their minds about with whom they should be and build their economic and political relations
7779141 a very strong signal to the west that were very serious
7779142 if youre not ready to give guarantees to the abkhazians and ossetians of peace and stability in the region we will recognize them
7779143 if the west is ready to give these guarantees russia will not recognize them

7779148 maafkan aku lalu ia mengeluarkan suapan roti dan diberikan kepada pengemis
7779149 wahai hamba allah relakah anda suapan ini anaknya hampir saja jadi santapan srigala sebagai gantinya suapan itu suapannya yang telah diberikan kepada seorang pengemis
7779150 wahai yang merupakan pusaka para pendahulu dan penolong orang orang yang telah ditinggal mereka telah membakar kemah kemah kita semua apa yang harus kami lakukan
7779151 aku melihat seorang perempuan berwibawa dan agung berdiri di hadapan kemah seraya menoleh ke arah kanan dan kiri terkadang ia melihat ke arah langit dan bumi lalu masuk ke dalam kemah dan keluar kembali
7779152 wahai syeikh di dalam kemah terdapat orang yang sakit parah beliau tidak mampu untuk duduk dan bangun bagaimana kami akan meninggalkannya sendirian di antara kobaran api
7779153 aku melihat zainab as masuk ke dalam kemah yang telah dipenuhi kobaran api kemudian beliau keluar dari dalam kemah dengan membawa seseorang aku mengira beliau mengeluarkan jenazah dari dalam kemah lalu aku mendekatinya supaya dapat melihat dengan jelas ternyata sosok tersebut adalah imam sajjad as
7779154 demi tuhan selama aku masih hidup niscaya dia tidak akan pernah terbunuh
7779155 diamlah wahai penduduk kufah para laki laki kalian telah membunuh orang orang kami apakah pantas para perempuan kalian menangis untuk kami ketahuilah allah swt akan menjadi hakim di hari pengadilan nanti dan akan mengadili kalian dan kami
7779156 aku melihat zainab binti ali saat itu tak pernah kusaksikan seorang tawanan yang lebih piawai darinya dalam berbicara seakan kata katanya keluar dari mulut imam ali as
7779157 puji syukur aku panjatkan pada allah swt yang telah mempermalukan kalian dan telah membuka kedok kebohongan kalian semuanya
7779158 yang sebenarnya dipermalukan allah ialah kalian yang fasik dan yang mempunyai kebohongan ialah para pendusta bukan kami
7779159 bagaimana pendapatmu tentang apa yang telah allah timpakan terhadap saudara dan keluargamu
7779160 aku memiliki seorang saudara yang bernama ali bin husain yang telah dibunuh oleh mereka
7779161 bani hasyim rasulullah telah bermain dengan kekuasaan padahal tidak ada berita yang datang dan wahyu yang turun

7779163 engkau memukul gigi husain dengan kayu ini aku melihat kayumu mengenai bagian yang sering dicium oleh rasul saww ingatlah wahai yazid pada hari kiamat engkau akan datang dengan ibnu ziyad sebagai pensyafaatmu dan kepala suci ini akan datang sedang rasul saww

7779166 qs al hadid 4 rasa ingin tahu hubbul istithla adalah merupakan salah satu fitrah manusia
7779167 berarti kalau gitu tuhan itu banyak dong khan katanya ada di mana mana
7779168 benar tuhan ada di mana mana akan tetapi tetap satu
7779169 apakah matahari hanya ada di tempat kamu saja atau di tempat temanmu yang ada di negara lainpun ada
7779170 wahai putriku tadi kamu katakan matahari itu hanya ada satu tapi di manapun kamu berada iapun ada nah tuhan pun seperti itu satu tapi ada di mana mana
7779171 qs al ikhlas 1 tentu kami tidak ingin mengatakan bahwa tuhan persis seperti matahari ini hanya untuk pendekatan saja
7779172 pendekatan pemahaman hal yang non materi tuhan dengan melalui hal yang materi atau inderawi
7779173 setiap perilaku yang diharapkan dinantikan oleh pihak lain terhadap setiap pemilik kedudukan tertentu
7779174 menempatkan sesuatu pada tempatnya atau memberikan sesuatu kepada yang berhak
7779175 jika kamu sekalian menyerah maka akan hina kalian sehingga para penjarah menyerbu kepadamu dan negerimu pun akan mereka kuasai
7779176 anak dapat terdidik sesuai dengan keinginan ibunya jika engkau ingin dia mengetahui makna keutamaan dan kemuliaan maka didiklah ibunya

7779179 beliau dinamakan fathimah karena tidak ada keburukan dan kejahatan pada dirinya
7779180 sewaktu sayidah fathimah zahra as terlahir allah swt memerintahkan para malaikat untuk turun ke bumi dan memberitahukan nama ini kepada rasulullah maka rasulullah saw pun memberi nama fathimah kepadanya
7779181 sesungguhnya aku telah menyapihmu dengan ilmu dan menyapihmu dari kototan
7779182 fathimah salam sejahtera atas fathimah karena engkau telah menamainya fathimah maka hati hatilah jangan sampai memukulnya mengucapkan perkataan buruk kepadanya dan muliakanlah ia
7779183 salah satu sebab sayidah fathimah dinamai az zahra karena tiga kali pada setiap hari beliau akan memancarkan cahaya bagi imam ali as
7779184 sebab sayidah fathimah dinamakan zahra karena akan diberikan kepada beliau sebuah bangunan di surga yang terbuat dari yaqut merah dikarenakan kemegahan dan keagungan bangunan tersebut maka para penghuni surga melihatnya seakan sebuah bintang di langit yang memancarkan cahaya dan mereka satu sama lain saling mengatakan bahwa bangunan megah bercahaya itu dikhususkan untuk fathimah as
7779185 karena sewaktu beliau berada di mihrab untuk beribadah cahaya memancar darinya untuk para penghuni langit bagaikan pancaran cahaya bagi para penghuni bumi
7779186 wahai fathimah sesungguhnya allah swt telah memilihmu mensucikanmu dan memilihmu atas perempuan seluruh alam
7779187 orang yang segala perkataan dan perilakunya telah diridhoi allah swt
7779188 sesungguhnya allah swt murka atas murka mu dan ridho atas keridhoan mu
7779189 aku telah menyampaikan berbagai masalah kepada fathimah benarkan percayailah segala yang disampaikan fathimah karena ia sangat jujur
7779190 tidak aku dapatkan seseorang yang lebih jujur dari fathimah selain ayahnya
7779191 dan barangsiapa yang mentaati allah dan rasul nya mereka itu akan bersama sama dengan orang orang yang dianugerahi nikmat oleh allah yaitu nabi nabi para shiddiiqiin orang orang yang mati syahid dan orang orang saleh dan mereka itulah teman yang sebaik baiknya
7779192 tiga hal berharga telah dihadiahkan kepadamu dan tidak seorangpun yang mendapatkannya termasuk aku engkau memiliki mertua seorang rasul sementara aku tidak memiliki mertua sepertimu engkau memiliki istri yang sangat jujur shiddiqqah seperti putriku sementara aku tidak memiliki istri sepertinya engkau dikaruniai anak anak seperti hasan dan husein sementara aku tidak dikaruniai anak anak seperti mereka namun demikian engkau berasal dariku dan aku berasal darimu
7779193 fathimah merupakan wewangianku ketika aku merindukan bau surga maka aku akan mencium fathimah
7779194 kenapa fathimah dijuluki al bathul karena beliau dari segi keutamaan agama dan kehormatan lebih dari para perempuan yang ada pada zamannya atau karena beliau telah memutuskan hubungannya dengan dunia dan hanyalah mencari kecintaan allah swt
7779195 yaitu perempuan yang tidak keluar darinya darah haid sesungguhnya hal itu tidak layak bagi para putri para nabi lain
7779196 ini hanutku ialah kapur barus yang dioleskan ke anggota sujud seorang jenazah red yang telah dibawakan jibril dari surga untukku
7779197 1 3 nya untuk engkau wahai ayahku sedang sisanya biarlah ali sendiri yang memutuskannya
7779198 engkau adalah wanita yang telah dianugrahi taufiq pertolongan khusus dan rasyidah petunjuk yang telah mendapatkan ilham dari nya dan mendapatkan petunjuk dari nya
7779199 setengah dari yang tersisa ialah untuk zahra fathimah dan berkaitan dengan sebagian lainnya apa perintahmu ya rasulullah
7779200 penghuni kain yaitu rasulullah imam ali sayidah fathimah zahra imam hasan dan imam husein hal ini dapat dirujuk dalam berbagai sumber seperti tafsir at thabari tafsir ad durrul mansur tarikh al bagdadi tafsir al kasyaf usudul ghabah
7779201 husein bin ali bin bobawaeh telah memberitahukan kepadaku bahwa muhamad bin hasan bin walid berkata
7779202 allah swt memiliki haram untuk dirinya yaitu mekkah mukarramah begitupula nabi muhammad saww memiliki haram yaitu madinah imam ali as pun memiliki haram yaitu kufah sekarang namanya najaf dan kami semuapun memiliki haram yaitu qom tidak akan lama lagi perempuan agung dari keturunan kami akan dimakamkan di tempat tersebut barang siapa yang menziarahi makamnya maka pahala surga atasnya
7779203 ya wahai yang jiwaku sebagai tebusannya aku telah melakukan semua amalan ini adalah supaya dapat mengetahui dengan jelas kuburannya sehingga aku dapat menziarahinya
7779204 demi kemaslahatan allah swt menghendaki kuburan beliau tetap menjadi misteri bagi semuanya
7779205 20 tahun sebelum kelahirannya jika tidak berhasil maka harus dimulai lebih cepat dari itu
7779206 nikahkanlah anak laki lakimu dengan perempuan yang sepadan denganya keimanan begitu pula anak perempuanmu

7779208 lihatlah dimana engkau letakkan anakmu karena nadi dan akar keturunannya akan berpengaruh terhadap anakmu
7779209 anakku sayang tuhan itu satu namun ada dimana mana seperti matahari itu satu namun ada dimana mana
7779210 masyaallah anak mamah pintar sekali anak mamah tambah bercahaya seperti bidadari mamah tambah sayang nih
7779211 apabila engkau mencintai seseorang maka katakanlah aku cinta padamu karena menunjukkan dan mengungkapkan rasa cinta akan menambah hubungan kalian semakin erat

7779216 people have to recognise that there isnt even a single case of corruption which was conclusively proven against mr zardari the matter has been politicised over the years people have made wild accusations
7779217 if in the coming weeks or months there are signs of the islamic insurgency beginning to be defeated it is possible that mr zardari will get credit for that
7779218 the main challenge however is that there are no easy solutions or short cuts in sight to deal with militants does this then expose him to criticism on his past thats the key question
7779219 aku akan mengatakan kepadamu anakku bagaimana dewa brahma menciptakan perempuan amoral tiada yang jahat ketimbang perempuan tuhan kakek yang mengajarkan apa yang ada di hati para dewa menciptakan perempuan jahat melalui ritual magis untuk memperdayai manusia

7779221 seorang suami dapat mencerai istrinya dikarenakan tidak mampu mengatur rumah tangga ataupun dikarenakan ada perempuan lain yang lebih cantik
7779222 seharusnya perempuan berdiam diri dan menerima ajaran dengan patuh aku tidak mengizinkan seorang perempuan mengajar dan juga tidak mengizinkanya memerintah laki laki hendaklah ia berdiam diri karena adam yang pertama dijadikan barulah hawa lagi pula bukan adam yang tergoda melainkan perempuan itulah yang tergoda

7779275 as the us side failed to keep its own side of the agreement we cannot but take the following measures under the principle of action for action
7779276 firstly weve decided to stop the denuclearisation process that has been underway in accordance with the october 3 agreement this measure already took effect on august 14 and relevant parties have already been informed

7779285 indicators will allow purchasers of health services both government and insurers to legitimately distinguish between effective providers of health care and less effective providers
7779286 this should further lower government and insurers costs to everyones benefit
7779287 this would allow private health insurers to make the choices for you

7779293 we will ban by legislation the mining of uranium in western australia and instead we will drive 100 per cent renewable energy production
7779294 uranium is in demand around the world because it offers a prospect of affordable reliable clean energy
7779295 how silly of us not to be part of that growth how silly of us or how silly of alan carpenter to deny developing countries reliable electricity for health education and potable water
7779296 our industry can take a long term view of this

7779298 we would expect a water tight law that would put this beyond doubt
7779299 there is no pressure on us because no one expects us to win
7779300 no one gives us any chance and obviously there are a few teams that think they should be in our spot but we have managed to secure a spot and just have to take advantage of that now
7779301 we have dug ourselves out of holes before and we have the finals to look forward to
7779302 there are eight other teams that wont be playing in a weeks time if we can recapture some form and a bit of confidence then there is plenty to look forward to
7779303 we are just going to back ourselves and make sure we dont fracture as a group and really work hard on the training track thats the way you work out of a bad patch
7779304 we have just got to make sure that we really attack the game come out with confidence back ourselves and obviously start well
7779305 we will need to shore up our defence put more pressure on as a midfield group and also better deliver to our forwards
7779306 coming into the semis there are going to be teams that play the 80 minutes the melbournes and the manlys so youve really got to work for 80 minutes against those teams
7779307 its fair to say the last couple of weeks weve clocked off for periods of time so its certainly in our minds not to do that
7779308 benny wayne bennett has upped the ante with two weeks to go to the semis
7779309 were not playing great guns at the moment and weve got a lot of things to prove

7779312 he thinks hes as famous as jen now last week he went to a party tipped off the paps and even had decoy cars at the ready when he was leaving nice but no one bothered to follow them which made john think he lost everyone when really it was because no one bothered to follow him
7779313 pictures of john and jen were selling for 20 000 at one point a picture of him alone gets 200 now chasing him from his apartment to a restaurant is hardly worth it
7779314 ik ben heel moe maar normaal ben ik sterker geworden na dit toernooi
7779315 voor argentini was die gouden medaille dan ook enorm belangrijk ons land heeft in china maar twee gouden en vier bronzen medailles behaald wij zijn niet zo goed in atletiek dus werd er sowieso veel verwacht van de voetbalploeg
7779316 ik had vooraf niet eens verwacht dat ik zou meegaan eerst was ik reservespeler dan werd ik toch nog opgeroepen maar verwachtte ik geen basisplaats en uiteindelijk speelde ik bijna alle matchen
7779317 er zijn vooraf toch veel discussies over gevoerd want anderlecht wilde mij niet missen voor de champions league matchen uiteindelijk vond anderlecht toch ook dat het een eer was om een speler af te vaardigen en hebben ze mij wel gesteund
7779318 obviously she knew while shes the victim she clearly didnt stand in the way of the cover up
7779319 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
7779320 the question for her as well as for him is what is their foundation what gives them a platform to engage in public issues
7779321 their big challenge is convincing people that they will continue to be active in politics and theyre going to continue to have a voice
7779322 an imperfect man with a truly progressive vision who spoke to and for those whom others ignored yes that is who i supported
7779323 an imperfect man who had come to face his own imperfections and was seeking to redeem himself to those closest to him yes that is who i supported
7779324 she knew she should not have participated in him running for president with this bomb waiting to go off she did she kinda loses my sympathy
7779325 i believe we are all owed a huge apology not self serving claims for pity by both john and elizabeth edwards who both knew about the affair and both decided to go forward and seek the democratic candidacy regardless of the titanic risk
7779326 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
7779327 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
7779328 air strikes on civilian targets uncoordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians
7779329 natos mission is based on a un mandate and carried upon the invitation of the afghan government
7779330 take every precaution to try to avoid innocent civilian casualties
7779331 the government of afghanistan has repeatedly discussed the issue of civilian casualties with the international forces and asked for all air raids on civilian targets especially in afghan villages to be stopped
7779332 the issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids

7779344 dogs do and always will cost money and yes they do need a place to sleep a bed food and water but ultimately there are measures owners can take to ensure this period of economic belt tightening does not cost dogs their homes pet insurance for instance enables owners to have their veterinary expenses covered in the event of accident or illness pet insurance policies start from as little as 10 per month which is just 32p per day food bills can be reduced dogs do not need to have the most expensive supermarket own brand pet food to be happy and healthy they can actually be happier and even healthier if owners do a deal with their local butcher to get the days unsold raw meat at reduced cost
7779345 there are currently over 100 000 dogs in shelter with such large numbers it goes without saying that there is a massive range of the type of dogs available there are pedigree puppies older dogs junior dogs literally all sorts and one of the many great advantages to adopting a dog is the fact that the new owner can get a very good idea of how the dog is going to turn out in terms of size temperament behaviour and personality this is a luxury not afforded to puppy buyers so in many ways adopting a dog greatly reduces the chance of an owner running in to problems later down the line which can often result in a dog being given up for adoption in the first place

7779369 weve come to renew our daughters rail ticket today tuesday 26 august and ended up on the phone for about five hours after discovering the huge increase in price between this year and last year
7779370 last year we paid 212 and she could use any service she liked but this year we have come to renew it and without any warning found the price is now 573
7779371 she has seven or eight friends who also use the train everyday and they are all finding the same thing its very frustrating and is making me furious
7779372 we already have the various bills in the household going up and now the cost of this has added even more to that which will worry people i havent been made aware of the change and then i suddenly have to find a huge amount of money

7779377 with the economic situation worsening and the property market still suffering we are calling on the government to take urgent action on hips
7779378 we have long seen hips as not fit for purpose and as the wrong answer to simplifying the house buying process
7779379 quite simply the government tried to force square pegs into round holes and the slower property market is making this situation worse
7779380 one of the many things the government needs to do to aid the failing housing market is to fundamentally reform hips to ensure that they are fit for purpose for all properties in all market conditions
7779381 consumers are paying for searches twice because in the current slow market legal searches are often out of date by the time a sale is agreed
7779382 these legal documents must be taken out of the packs and left to buyers and their advisers to obtain at the appropriate time during the transaction
7779383 hips are already bringing benefits to consumers by providing important information to help families cut their fuel bills and carbon emissions and have reduced the price of property searches by increasing transparency in the home buying and selling process
7779384 first time buyers are also receiving the information in the hip for free helping to reduce costs for households looking to get on to the property ladder
7779385 we are continuing to work with stakeholders including the naea to consider how the home buying and selling process can be improved further including through enhancing the hip
7779386 its a sad indictment of our broken society that so many are turning to things like drug and alcohol abuse at such a young age
7779387 the government needs to take action now before its too late the nhs needs a robust strategy to improve public health like the one we proposed last year with ring fenced budgets and proper accountability and we must do more to tackle the wider causes of social breakdown
7779388 that means we need to strengthen families radically reform the welfare system and provide more good school places
7779389 ensuring young people are in good health is a top government priority which is why we are working hard on a large number of initiatives to deal with this problem
7779390 more people are accessing services as there is more top quality help available and waiting lists at their lowest level since records began
7779391 for this reason the chief medical officer is producing a new set of guidelines on young people and alcohol
7779392 we have expanded the range of services that are available including provision in pharmacies youth services and colleges and a 15 to 24 year old chlamydia screening programme
7779393 a number of people have sustained injuries and both carriageways have been closed
7779394 the motorway is not expected to be reopened until noon due to damage caused to the central reservation and the need to remove heavy vehicles from the carriageways
7779395 diversions have been put in place but heavy congestion is expected
7779396 the group considers that the current difficult trading environment will continue for the foreseeable future with continued poor mortgage liquidity limiting housing market activity
7779397 given current sentiment this is likely to further reduce private sales prices and profit margins achievable on incremental reservations over the remainder of 2008
7779398 whilst thousands of people came to join in with the fun and spectacle of carnival once again the event ended with a small minority of people determined to fight and cause trouble
7779399 for over two hours our officers were faced with a hardcore mainly of young men who came to carnival not to enjoy the event but to fight commit crime and cause trouble
7779400 officers had to work hard and deliver a strong interventionist style of policing late into the night to make sure that these criminals were not allowed to take over the streets of notting hill
7779401 this is not the way anyone can want to see the carnival finish
7779402 through our stop and search use of screening wands and seizures of dangerous dogs we sent a clear message that carnival is no place for such behaviour as this
7779403 a fast time intelligence led operation in oval managed to stop a large group we believed were headed for the carnival to commit such scenes of disorder
7779404 no one wants to see this unique event being overshadowed by such unacceptable behaviour
7779405 as a former resident of ladbroke grove i have watched the notting hill carnival go from strength to strength each year to become an internationally acclaimed event
7779406 nothing beats the sounds of the steel pans the aroma of delicious caribbean food and the dazzling colours of the costume parade
7779407 the carnival is the perfect london spectacle to captivate the world with its dazzling array of costumes and music
7779408 this years event was enjoyed by more than a million people as the sights and sounds of the caribbean and other cultures came alive on the streets
7779409 ive been very impressed its been lively and colourful and people are really enjoying themselves
7779410 the number of arrests is up on last year but that is predominantly because of proactive policing
7779411 the message is that there is no place for knives at the carnival
7779412 we share the concern of londoners over the recent spate of knife crime and we are doing all we can to combat that
7779413 we are extremely shocked and saddened by the news that one of our students from qatar has tragically passed away following an attack upon him on friday night
7779414 we are working closely together with the police and assisting them fully to support their investigations
7779415 our deepest sympathies at this very difficult time remain with the students family
7779416 i was cleaning when it happened a boy called my name put a mobile in my hand and said call the police
7779417 i saw the english boys attack the arab boys in the street there were two fights but i didnt see the second
7779418 i have been told that they punched him he fell down then they kicked him in the head
7779419 its a big tragedy for hastings well see how this affects the language schools and host families those boys are very cruel i knew something would happen because theres always problems here
7779420 i think what happened is so so bad all the people when they come to study english next year may not choose here because there are problems
7779421 i get scared now i told my host family i want to stay at home
7779422 i am appealing for anyone who witnessed the assault to contact police it was a busy time of the evening and there were many young people in the area i am sure many of them would have seen what happened
7779423 the young man was a visitor to hastings and his death is indeed tragic our thoughts are with his family
7779424 the young man had spent about five weeks in hastings and was due to return home next weekend his death is incredibly sad
7779425 vegetarians and their hezbollah like splinter faction the vegans are a persistent irritant to any chef worth a damn to me life without veal stock pork fat sausage organ meat demiglace or even stinky cheese is a life not worth living
7779426 vegetarianism has become so popular of late among the members of the peerage that no smart dinner is complete without a separate menu of
7779427 other prominent advocates of the vegetarian diet are the countess of essex lady windsor lady gwendolen herbert lady hamilton mrs c leigh hunt wallace and the earl of buchan

7779442 protective orders which govern the exchange of information outside of a public docket are obtained pursuant to a good cause standards
7779443 when such information is filed with a court however it becomes part of a public document subject to the right of public access absent showing a compelling justification and a clearly defined and serious injury
7779444 took place so long ago that there is no likely reason their disclosure would cause competitive disadvantage
7779445 litigants may not seal information merely because public disclosure will be embarrassing or will otherwise reflect poorly on them
7779446 there are scores of oems original equipment manufacturers that have skin in the game
7779447 we trust the court can find a way to protect the companies trade secrets without blocking all information on the allegations in this case
7779448 wed also hope that in reviewing our motion the court decides that providing trade secret protection to evidence related to illegal business practices and behavior would be adverse to the public interest

7779479 we aim to introduce work to overflateteknikk in scotland and of course hopefully the agreement will assist msis in attracting and securing work in norway a key area of business growth for us
7779480 the norwegian market is very mature and companies can only enter it through innovative means many contractors encounter difficulties breaking into the market however our relationship with overflateteknikk will hopefully attract and secure the attention of the big players in norway who we can approach with confidence

7779505 eine solche w rdigung durch europas gr te sport zeitschrift ist etwas ganz besonderes f r uns besonders bemerkenswert ist dass in diesem spannenden sportjahr eben nicht die hochglanzprodukte rund um die sportlichen highlights wie olympische spiele oder fu ball europameisterschaft ausgezeichnet werden sondern diejenigen redaktionen innerhalb der ard die tagt glich haupts chlich den regionalen sport beleuchten und f r eine angemessene hintergrundberichterstattung sorgen hier kann die ard ihre f derale struktur voll zur wirkung bringen denn nur durch sie und das damit verbundene engagement in den einzelnen landesrundfunkanstalten ist es m glich ber den regionalen sport mit hoher kompetenz und glaubw rdigkeit zu berichten
7779506 unser dank gilt den vielen kolleginnen und kollegen aus den sportredaktionen die sich ber diese auszeichnung genauso freuen werden wie ich es soll ihnen kurz anlass zum zur cklehnen und genie en sein aber auch wieder ansporn auf diesem weg weiter zu machen und die sportberichterstattung in den dritten weiter voran zu bringen
7779507 acetylsalicylic acid aspirin is based on a plant stress hormone
7779508 i asked myself could there be other plant stress hormones that have clinical efficacy while various studies have suggested that aspirin can prevent cancer especially colon cancer i realized that there could be a chance to find a potent plant hormone that could fight cancer even better i pinpointed jasmonate
7779509 the jasmonate compound is used widely in agriculture and in cosmetics
7779510 proven to be non toxic it has the same regulatory status as table salt that and the fact we are working on a natural chemical gives us a good starting point for launching a new drug

7779551 we dont understand the purpose of sleep but it must be important because all animals do it
7779552 the very fact that dolphins have developed the remarkable specialization rather than merely getting rid of sleep altogether should count as evidence that sleep must serve some essential function and cannot be eliminated
7779553 sleep may be the price you pay so your brain can be plastic the next day
7779554 while there may still be no consensus on why animals need to sleep it would seem that searching for a core function of sleep particularly at the cellular level is still a worthwhile exercise

7779604 the attack scooped up the personal details of every single customer that has booked into one of best westerns 1 312 continental hotels since 2007
7779605 the story printed in the glasgow sunday herald claiming a security breach of best western guest information is grossly unsubstantiated
7779606 claims reported about our central reservations customer records are not accurate
7779607 the sunday herald reporter brought to our attention the possible compromise of a select portion of data at a single hotel we investigated immediately and provided commentary
7779608 best western would have welcomed the opportunity to fact check the story which would have resulted in more accurate and credible reporting on the part of the newspaper
7779609 we have found no evidence to support the sensational claims ultimately made by the reporter and newspaper
7779610 it is extremely difficult to see how the cost of employing 36 video journalists in scotland can be justified
7779611 it certainly would not be considered cost effective in the private sector
7779612 there is a further concern that the enormous advantage of the bbc to cross promote its online news services via radio and television would seriously distort the market by attracting users from the websites of regional and local newspapers with consequential damaging effects
7779613 we are deeply concerned about the potential adverse impact on regional and local newspapers an impact not outweighed in our opinion by any value for money to licence fee payers or society as a whole
7779614 some of the allegations would appear on their face to be defamatory allegations of dishonesty or criminality for example
7779615 others might fall into what is generally known in the context of slander as being mere vulgar abuse as opposed to genuine examples of defamation
7779616 for example the claimant has been described by some as a destructive twerp as a bulletin board bully as suffering from megalomania as suffering from bipolar disorder and one allegation was to the effect that even if his mother told him he had been a naughty boy he would sue for defamation of character
7779617 mere vulgar abuse which would not necessarily be taken by reasonable readers to be intended to be accurate and therefore may not be defamatory
7779618 he cannot be 100 percent cured but his life quality has improved if once he depended on others to do his activities now he can eat by himself use his hand to write use the cell phone

7779628 we have zero tolerance for employing people who are not authorized to work in the u s and use all available tools provided by the u s government to verify the documents of the people we hire

7779631 police arrested me on sunday morning and then locked me up in a cell with the four men the men were at the back of the cell
7779632 there was a bed in the cell and i went to lie down on it one man kicked me awake i screamed for help but nobody came to help me
7779633 i was crying the men took turns at about 06 00 the police arrived and i told them what had happened i had to make a statement and was taken to the kimberley hospital i also saw a counsellor this morning monday
7779634 my stomach felt like it was turning inside out they must lock up men like that in a separate cell
7779635 the complainant said police had called her a tomboy and said she had to be locked up with the four men in the cell she was then raped
7779636 they also helped her get medical care the case file has been given back to police for further investigation the official who locked up the woman with the men will be dealt with by the department

7779641 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
7779642 the question for her as well as for him is what is their foundation what gives them a platform to engage in public issues
7779643 their big challenge is convincing people that they will continue to be active in politics and theyre going to continue to have a voice
7779644 an imperfect man with a truly progressive vision who spoke to and for those whom others ignored yes that is who i supported
7779645 an imperfect man who had come to face his own imperfections and was seeking to redeem himself to those closest to him yes that is who i supported
7779646 she knew she should not have participated in him running for president with this bomb waiting to go off she did she kinda loses my sympathy
7779647 i believe we are all owed a huge apology not self serving claims for pity by both john and elizabeth edwards who both knew about the affair and both decided to go forward and seek the democratic candidacy regardless of the titanic risk
7779648 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
7779649 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt

7779663 hydrogen vehicles there are two different kinds there a fuel cell vehicle and a hydrogen engine vehicle but the common theme is that they all have a hydrogen tank its just a matter of how they use the hydrogen in the vehicle they all have no carbon emissions at all no co2 in the case of the fuel cell vehicles theres absolutely zero emissions at all coming out of the tailpipe just water vapor that safe enough to drink
7779664 when you use hydrogen in an internal combustion engine you really have the same performance as engines designed to run on gasoline and in the future when we design an engine around the fuel well actually be able to surpass the performance of a gasoline engine
7779665 its going to take time we want to be in a position where the market will drive those outcomes and if consumers want hydrogen driven cars and thats the market the infrastructure will follow that

7779678 to find that this amniotic compartment which we have traditionally viewed as somewhat sacrosanct is infected significantly more often than we thought is a little shocking
7779679 weve become very good at growing some bacterial species what might be called the weeds of the microbial world

7779719 o people here comes over you a great month a most blessed month in which lies a night more greater in virtue than one thousand months it is a month in which allah has made compulsory that the days should be observed by fasting and he has made sunnah the tarawih by the night whosoever intends drawing nearer to allah by performing any virtuous deed for him shall be the reward like him who had performed a fardhu in any other time and whoever performs a fardhu for him shall be the reward of the seventy fardhu in any other time this is indeed the month of patience and the reward for true patience is jannah paradise it is the month of sympathy with a fellowman it is the month wherein a true believers rizq benefits is increased whosoever feeds another man who are fasting in order to break the fast at sunset for him there shall be forgiveness for his sins and emancipation from the fire of jahannam hell and for him shall be the same reward as him whom he fed without that persons reward being decreased in the least
7779720 o rasulullah not all of us possess the means whereby we could give a fasting person food to break his fast
7779721 allah grants this same reward to him who gives a fasting person food to break his fast even for a mere dates or a cup of water or a sip of milk
7779722 this is a month where the earlier portion of the month brings allahs mercy the middle part of the month of which brings his forgiveness and the last portion of the month which brings emancipation from the fire of jahannam hell
7779723 whosoever lessens the burden of his servants bondsmen or workers in this month allah will forgive him and free him from the fire of jahannam
7779724 and in this month four 4 things you should continue to perform in great number two 2 of which shall be to please allah while the other two 2 shall be those without which you could not do

7779731 the largest portion of it is media spin and groups that have no association with her campaign
7779732 theyre groups that are more into making a statement about themselves rather than about the democratic party or senator clinton
7779733 were going to see a rousing speech from her she can give such a great speech its going to bring the convention together and its going to be a united convention

7779749 were going to add 4 500 megawatts of hydroelectricity 4 000 megawatts of wind power and were going to add to that new sources of energy including biofuels
7779750 youre actually able to negotiate a very long contract on predictable pricing which you cannot do if you are basing yourself on carbon based energy
7779751 electricity is a massive cost when you manufacture traditional polysilicon so they should be able to reduce their production costs pretty significantly
7779752 ill be voting for my brother or ill be kicked out of the family by my mother
7779753 just as the big boost to infrastructure ive announced today reflects last years strong economic performance the economic challenges were facing this year mean i can safely predict i wont make this kind of announcement 12 months from now
7779754 ontarians deserve to know where all federal parties stand on fairness for ontario
7779755 they scored early and we didnt i think that was the difference in the game
7779756 about halfway through we started getting our shooting on and we closed the gap but it wasnt enough time
7779757 teams try to intimidate us we are small were young were fast and teams try to beat us up but were not going to back down from anyone
7779758 my game plan was just to play straight lacrosse were actually the most unpenalized team in the west
7779759 obviously she knew while shes the victim she clearly didnt stand in the way of the cover up
7779760 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
7779761 did you know that when you walk past a flower whether it be in somebodys garden or on a vacant hillside the flower will always smile at you the most polite way to respond ive been told is to cheerfully return the smile
7779762 happiness is to take up the struggle in the midst of the raging storm
7779763 to live content with small means to seek elegance rather than luxury and refinement rather than fashion to be worthy not respectable and wealthy not rich to study hard think quietly talk gently act frankly to listen to stars and birds to babes and sages with open heart to bear all cheerfully do all bravely await occasion hurry never in a word to let the spiritual unbidden and unconscious grow up through the common this is to be my symphony
7779764 how to make the world notice your video game blog
7779765 bowser takes peach mario chases after bowser bowser falls into some lava the end
7779766 could be the largest fish in the world and we know next to nothing about it
7779767 obviously she knew while shes the victim she clearly didnt stand in the way of the cover up
7779768 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
7779769 the question for her as well as for him is what is their foundation what gives them a platform to engage in public issues
7779770 their big challenge is convincing people that they will continue to be active in politics and theyre going to continue to have a voice
7779771 an imperfect man with a truly progressive vision who spoke to and for those whom others ignored yes that is who i supported
7779772 an imperfect man who had come to face his own imperfections and was seeking to redeem himself to those closest to him yes that is who i supported
7779773 she knew she should not have participated in him running for president with this bomb waiting to go off she did she kinda loses my sympathy
7779774 i believe we are all owed a huge apology not self serving claims for pity by both john and elizabeth edwards who both knew about the affair and both decided to go forward and seek the democratic candidacy regardless of the titanic risk
7779775 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
7779776 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
7779777 i will continue my quest to find the next kate moss
7779778 to find that face thats out there somewhere at a football game or at a rock concert its just fueled my passion for the industry
7779779 im a pretty tough boot camp sergeant i demand perfection in myself and i expect it with the people around me especially keeping the kids focused
7779780 do they want to go out and have careers or do they want boyfriends or girlfriends
7779781 after getting the boot on top model i knew exactly how i wanted to do a show
7779782 and tyra banks knew it when she hired me in the first place which propelled her show into a phenomenal franchise in itself
7779783 these guys got rejected on the third season so theyre not there we have a new flock
7779784 i love their relationship because that was the best part of their story line but it was just hard to explore without them getting a lot of jobs
7779785 being too fit when is that an issue with modeling i dont get that
7779786 it allows me to give back in a field and an industry that i worship
7779787 i still want to remain in the picture if i cant be in front of the camera im behind it

7779791 we are not satisfied with the current status of our relations we dont see a reason why arab countries hesitate and why they have not recognized until now the new republic of kosovo we hope that in the coming months because its a matter of months the relations between these countries and the republic of kosovo will take a new positive form
7779792 we believe that the opportunities for political economic and other relations with the arab world are great with the recognition of kosovo state by the arab ones a new chapter will open which will allow the growth and advancement of these relations
7779793 kosovo as a state has no policy towards the arab world to our arab friends if it serves as consolation it should be explained that kosovo has no foreign policy so there is no foreign policy towards the arab world either the parliament of kosovo has yet to discuss the countrys foreign policy whether in commissions or general sessions for the moment there is no guiding document that explains what this country aims for in the short term midterm or long term in its relations with the world as with what is called the arab world

7779801 they are still so strong that i can see them and chelsea being the two slugging it out again for the title
7779802 they will probably meet again in a repeat of the champions league final too i shouldnt wonder
7779803 certainly i think arsenal and liverpool have it all on to finish above them
7779804 chelsea were very strong last week and united will be even stronger than they are now if they sign dimitar berbatov from tottenham as i think they will in the next few days
7779805 weve been a good team over the past two seasons and im confident well be a decent team again we are a new team with a few players just getting over injuries and once we play a bit more and get to understand each other we will be okay
7779806 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7779807 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7779808 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7779809 to discuss ways in which his foundation is addressing some of the worlds most pressing problems
7779810 president clinton understands this is sen obamas convention and he is here to do all he can to make sen obama our next president
7779811 were talking about the nominee for the president of the united states
7779812 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7779813 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1

7779909 the 2008 august 26 general uprising has its roots in resistance against the thaksin system with the thai weekly program being the origin of the sondhi phenomenon leading to the yellow t shirt movement which fought for the king in 2005
7779910 that is violation of the king by people in the party and government
7779911 and blatantly violating the constitution and various laws delaying justice debilitating the dignity and trust of the justice process especially the courts
7779912 in truth the general uprising is the last chapter and a new face in the war for goodness that is a war of good thamma against the unjust atham
7779913 i want to add that this general uprising is quite unique compared to other uprisings in the world in that it comes from love not from resentment nor from the aggreived or the persecuted who have been so intimidated that they do not see or feel it themselves or who join with those who persecute them
7779914 this general uprising is characterised by the breadth of those who will join i call on the police the military civil servants business people bankers teachers and intellectuals to join in

7779949 it is never easy for israel to decide on the early release of convicted palestinian terrorists the issue is one fraught with emotional overtones for israelis in general and the families of terrorism victims in particular in these instances israels decision makers have been faced with both political and moral dilemmas all the while they remain fully cognizant of the security risks posed to the israeli public by such measures
7779950 how long did it take the government to hold a discussion of the release of 200 terrorists including two who caused the murder of israelis no more than three minutes all this without having an depth discussion and without hearing the positions of the security arms the discussion took place at the start of the government meeting and those who arrived late did not participate in the vote foreign minister tzipi livni who intended to explain at the meeting why she agreed to the move was not given the floor on the matter and her statement on the matter was delivered by her spokesperson to the press moreover the shabbak and idf confirm that they were not even approached on the matter and instead were advised of the matter as a finalized fact
