20000 i just moved my mom out to atlanta with me i bought her a townhouse so i dont have to go too far shes my closest companion
20001 my brothers tumour for the time being is in limbo its not growing for the time being which is good news
20002 you know she wasnt the kind that played with dolls and then all of the sudden she has all of these children
20003 thats definitely been the rumour and its been coming from their west and obamas camp i hear that its his obamas birthday that weekend so he might be in town
20004 but these guys youre never going to know anything until the last minute anyway
20005 britney started wearing clothes and lindsay lohan has gone gay
20006 if the ones that attract the paparazzi behave in the first place like we expect of anybody that solves about 90 per cent of the problem the rest we can deal with
20007 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
20008 when you pick up a two foot eight inch 81 3 centimetres human being and throw him to the floor it hurts

20010 this is a huge victory for us today we look forward to continuing with our sexual harassment suit against the lowes
20011 we didnt lose anything today im delighted with the dismissal we won and in essence our lawsuit against gibson remains totally intact
20012 although we did not get especially cold during the spring we did have just enough freezing weather just prior to heading to cause some sterile heads further contributing to lower yields
20013 law governing an acceptable filming distance from an unwilling subject to keep everybody safe and misbehaviour accountable
20014 i dont sit before you today to ask that you ban the paparazzi
20015 i dont want to beg the city of los angeles to give me 1987 back i love being a famous musician in 2008 this is about safety
20016 as we all know his conduct was outrageous and clearly life threatening
20017 the fact is he is likely to spend the rest of his life in a high security mental hospital
20018 happy he is going to get help rather than prison
20019 the key issue being dealt with now regarding this first wave of mosquitoes is the annoyance factor lots of mosquitoes and lots of mosquito bites
20020 however as time passes those species of mosquitoes more likely to transmit disease begin to breed in the standing water that remains
20021 local state and federal officials are coordinating on where when and what to spray
20022 this is a regional approach with county and city health departments one of the things were doing now is surveillance to determine and document mosquito activity
20023 chemical applications are being done by ground by the area entities involved
20024 the spraying is being done in the early morning or late evening when the mosquitoes are most active local entities are implementing control efforts and our department is providing leadership and technical assistance
20025 were on top of this problem and are working in the interest of public health
20026 the department of state health service is coordinating efforts locally and trying to identify the supplies and treatments for the most effective insect vector control possible
20027 we want the public to know what were doing and to let them know what they can do to protect themselves and eliminate mosquito breeding conditions
20028 people who need to leave their doors and windows open should make sure their screens are repaired and in good condition
20029 they can also protect themselves by wearing long pants and long sleeved shirts using a repellent with deet and by judicious use of over the counter mosquito control products of course its important they read and follow all labeling instructions
20030 some of the items people may want to investigate for water thats been standing for a while include flower pots dog bowls bird baths old tires basins and clogged gutters anything that can catch and hold water
20031 even standing water in bottles and cans will breed mosquitoes
20032 after a few weeks if standing water remains different types of mosquitoes typically breed in that water he said
20033 disease transmitting species of aedes and culex mosquitoes are stagnant water breeders and these are more typically associated with west nile virus and st louis encephalitis so its very important that people eliminate these potential breeding sites
20034 the conduct of federal programs or other programs or operations essential to the interests of our nation
20035 increased information sharing will benefit the department congress and the public as well as the private sector which controls the vast majority of the nations cyber infrastructure
20036 it is my hope that the release of this information will assist in improving security in both the public and private sectors
20037 protection of federal networks and the security of our homeland
20038 on march 20th you announced that rod beckstrom would be the director of the new national cyber security center within dhs

20043 why was the determination made that the contract will be for a 10 month period
20044 how will the dhs provide appropriate oversight to ensure that the contractors support efforts do not intrude on inherently governmental functions
20045 technological upgrades and planning activities are classified dhs will be happy to provide the committee with a briefing in the appropriate classified setting
20046 it is this market based self governing nature of the internet that is the key to its success
20047 your heavy handed attempts to inject the fcc into the middle of that process threaten to hijack the evolution of the internet to everyones detriment
20048 we believe our actions taken in good faith in response to consumers concerns further confirm the wisdom of the commissions long standing policy showing regulatory restraint
20049 the venue hypothesis suggests that even when the price approaches zero all other things being equal people are more likely to act habitually say using the pirate bay than to break their habit say visiting www inrainbows com
20050 the pirate bay is a powerful brand with a sterling reputation in the minds of millions of young music fans
20051 frequently music industry professionals suggest that an increase in legitimate sales must necessarily coincide with a commensurate reduction in piracy as if this were a fact
20052 yet the company bigchampagne has made no such consistent observation in nearly a decade of analyzing these data
20053 the challenge of achieving popularity or attention when the old rules of scarcity and excludability dont apply to information goods the way they used to changes the monetization game completely
20054 this better not mean that all applications will always be connecting to the internet to see what is going on all of the time
20055 with airline customer satisfaction at an all time low this is not the time to consider making airplane travel even more torturous

20062 i have always had a dread of becoming a passenger in life
20063 people have said to me from the day that i took this job they said look its the worst job in australia in politics
20064 but if i listened to commentators instead of doing what i think is right then id be losing objectivity
20065 i am absolutely determined with everything ive ever done in my life to see it through and i will lead us through to the next election
20066 every new governor general has the right to decide who her or his official secretary should be
20067 we believe that when it comes to budget policy we have done the right thing it is the right course of action
20068 and as i said a 22 billion surplus is the best way you can position this economy going forward it gives you a buffer for the future
20069 the big challenge is as you know getting the balance right between not having an economy which is plagued by high levels of inflation forcing interest rates up over the long term while at the same time ensuring enough activity continues to be generated in the economy
20070 we have got our fiscal settings as right as we can but it is going to be tough tough in the sense of the impact on peoples family budgets
20071 look at the overall profitability levels of our banks they are huge therefore i believe they have got a responsibility to pass on
20072 we have had inflation running at 16 year highs as of when we came into office that then flows into interest rates and we have had 12 of those on the trot going up
20073 that then affects the level of activity in the economy and that in turn affects ultimately employment but when it comes to the statistics provided by the abs australian bureau of statistics it is not appropriate for politicians or prime ministers to speculate on future data
20074 the bottom line is we have an impact on the global economy flowing through to australia from the credit crisis coming out of the us sub prime
20075 we have had the further shock to the economy coming off the back of the global oil shock the biggest that weve seen since the 1970s
20076 the key challenge is that we have a course a pathway through this and thats got to be built on a strong approach to budget policy and a strong approach to long term economic reform so that we can come through this in better shape

20105 it seems that the work that our paramedics do is being taken for granted
20106 they are highly trained in rescue situations and do a wonderful job for our community
20107 and while the vehicle may not be relocated for several months it is better that we air our objections now than when it is too late
20108 this season is looking bright as our bookings are up on previous years
20109 already we have attained a number of very good brood mares and quality mares that have finished racing
20110 it mainly affected our interstate clients who were unable to move their mares into the area to be covered by our stallions
20111 fortunately we already had some mares on the farm which was an advantage
20112 as the brand developed people just came and we realised that it didnt matter if we were away from the cbd
20113 people who have been visiting the hunter valley for 20 years or so will come to broke for the first time and say how amazing it is
20114 so we decided that if people were going to come here when they arrived they would get everything in the one location and all of the best quality
20115 it was good timing a lot of hard work and having a good distributor that got us to where we are today

20127 they are a fantastic group of people and very supportive i really enjoy it especially the people

20132 i think it clearly came from senator obama s campaign and i don t think it was the kind of debate we should be having in this campaign mrs clinton told reporters
20133 this is an unfortunate story line the obama campaign has pushed very successfully mrs clinton said later on meet the press i dont think this campaign is about gender and i sure hope its not about race
20134 will mark the day that race officially became an issue in the 2008 general election

20145 a politician is an animal which can sit on a fence and yet keep both ears to the ground
20146 i have a question i m not voting for obama so am i a racist
20147 the comments by the clintons actually may have helped mr obama in some ways by coaxing key democrats like senator ted kennedy to his side while energizing black voters in states he won like south carolina
20148 one of obamas female staff distributed a confidential memo to carefully selected journalists which alleged that a vaguely clumsy comment hillary clinton had made about martin luther king

20236 what hangs at a mans thigh and wants to poke the hole that its often poked before answer a key
20237 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
20238 made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops seems the pentagon wouldnt allow him to bring cameras
20239 is more to the left than the announced socialist in the united states senate bernie sanders of vermont
20240 i dont know all i know is his voting record and thats what people usually judge their elected representatives by
20241 the thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
20242 i had the courage and the judgment to say that i would rather lose a political campaign than lose a war it seems to me that senator obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
20243 this ad asserts a mccain campaign talking point that obama wouldnt make time for wounded troops unless cameras were allowed to follow him but did make time to work out at a gym
20244 the best aspect of a mccain presidency is that while it would probably follow the policies of george w bush it would put an end to the politics of karl rove
20245 that healing gift is what mccain at his best brings to the presidential race not the brass marching band of military valor but the tolerance of someone who has truly suffered
20246 at least i dont plaster on the makeup like a trollop you cunt
20247 it is full of great information and research so i asked her if i could share it with my readers and she agreed

20249 the material isnt lodging in their minds there is not enough internalization of knowledge
20250 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
20251 why do we always have to go to the beach
20252 this trial told us a lot about the vehicles being disposed of and their owners much of which was new and unexpected
20253 this information will certainly help with any further work in this area
20254 this decision has been informed by the input of individual beekeepers industry representatives and the results from the autumn varroa surveillance and the exotic bee disease surveillance programme

20256 these guys are a serious rock and roll band one that wouldnt sound out of place opening for any current chart topper
20257 much of it is dependent on how much water they can continue to take out of the hillside because it is the water pressure building up and creating the subsidence

20259 there was absolutely positively no doubt in my mind right then and there whoever this was was shooting at me they were trying to kill me
20260 i swung around and i see a human form just for a fraction of a second long enough i could just see its a human being and an adult
20261 as soon as that human form part of the body is back in the doorway i hear gunshots
20262 i could have stayed there and got killed which was not an option in my mind
20263 i did i fired those shots that eventually killed her
20264 you cant bring in information after the fact the officer had no way of knowing
20265 all the officer can do is react to what he sees
20266 i thought the team was coming under fire i dropped down to one knee to try to identify a target
20267 its really nice to be able to talk to older veterans and at the same time the guys who served at the same time as me
20268 a few of the older veterans came up to me and thanked me and i just returned the favor and said the same thing to them thanks
20269 its a great feeling to have grandfather and grandson side by side this whole area is veteran oriented and we really support our veterans
20270 those who are serving are serving to protect our rights at home
20271 when veterans come home they become leaders in their communities
20272 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
20273 we did find a tree on the ridge on buckley mountain that was exploded it was definitely a recent lightning hit
20274 its an incredible shame the building was an icon hopefully it will be rebuilt its kind of a shock
20275 often we get stuck on the immensity of such a project this workshop series will help to make that desire a reality
20276 you never know whether it will become chronic or not
20277 hell do everything he can to play on sunday im looking forward to him rehabbing and being back for that dallas game
20278 orr shows up every day in practice making a play doing something
20279 hes shown up rushing the passer some as an inside linebacker as an outside linebacker he does have some versatility which is good

20284 we continue to be optimistic in our outlook and are encouraged by our second quarter net income for the year to date we are down only 3 6 percent compared to last year with this year including 580 000 in loan loss expense versus zero last year our efforts to increase loans which have grown by over 50 million were quite successful we are expanding our marketing efforts to increase our deposit base in order to fund earning assets in the meantime we have utilized short term funding which has proven to be advantageous to our earnings
20285 our expense control efforts continue and have been effective we believe our management of the yield volume and mix of earning assets combined with efforts to increase deposits and reduce our cost of funds should have a positive impact on our future net interest margin and income central virginia bank continues to be a fundamentally sound financial institution
20286 uhhh excuse me maam i mean like i know youre the governor and youre as old as my grandma but uhhh could i see your id
20287 actually the hero of the game is himself a zombie from the himalayan mountains on a quest to save the remaining humans from the zombies that have infested it
20288 he confessed he cut her up and even photographed the body on his cellular phone
20289 it was a failure of institutional inclination saving danieal was just too much trouble
20290 he did not complete a single investigation or risk assessment
20291 indeed his file on the family was buried at the bottom of a filing cabinet sized box beneath food wrappers and unopened envelopes relating to other childrens cases
20292 you cant continue to bury these children and say things are getting better when theyre not
20293 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
20294 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
20295 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
20296 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic
20297 this particular incident as horrific as it is is obviously extremely rare
20298 her hospital visit was precautionary she will be returning home shortly at present she is surrounded by family friends and fabulous jewels
20299 pernah dengar cerita aisyah bukhari yang murtad tak lama dulu
20300 assalamualaikum ayah ni intan nama manja cakap intan nak bagitahu intan dah kristian
20301 saya lennet teoh hui leong telah dilantik oleh nur aisyah untuk memberi nasihat kepadanya berkenaan dengan pertukaran agamanya kepada kristian dan atas arahannya saya telah menyediakan surat sumpah untuk nur aisyah menolak dan meninggalkan agama islam
20302 saya lennet teoh percaya bahawa nur aisyah sedang dikurung secara salah oleh keluarganya saya percaya tindakan ibubapa abangnya dan bapa saudaranya telah melanggar hak kebebasan nur aisyah menganut agama pilihannya iaitu kristian khatolik
20303 mana mana undang undang yang bertentangan yang bercanggah dengan perlembagaan ini adalah batal dan tidak sah ini termasuklah hukum syara
20304 dibawah perlembagaan persekutuan hak seorang anak tertakluk dibawah jagaan ibubapanya selagi belum cukup 18 tahun kalau nak tukar agama kena minta kebenaran ibu bapanya semasa suzie teoh masuk islam berumur 16 tahun dia tak sah peluk islam
20305 saya yang arif kekal dalam agama saya saya masih nak nama nur aini
20306 bersegeralah kamu melakukan amalan soleh kerana akan datang kepad a umatku di suatu masa satu fitnah yang begitu besar yang datangnya seperti satu kepingan hitam di malam gelap gelita tak nampak
20307 fitnah itu adalah kamu akan lihat umatku di hari itu di waktu itu pada masa itu pagi hari islam petang kafir petang islam pagi kafir balik
20308 akan datang fitnah murtadini dalam keadaan seperti semut hitam di atas batu hitam di malam gelap
20309 kepada semua pemimpim pemimpin kristian kita hari ini telah melakukan kesilapan besar kita berperang dengan tentera islam dengan pedang bukan berperang dengan akidah yang ada pada mereka sebab tu islam menang walaupun 30 ribu tentera mereka dengan 300 ribu tentera kita mereka tetap menang sebab mereka orang islam berperang kerana nak mati kita perang untuk hidup oleh itu hendaklah kita tukar strategi melancarkan peperangan ideologi fahaman dan budaya keatas orang islam
20310 so i guess thats where i left that web shooter
20311 whats wrong honey why are you so angry oh say hi to emma you know emma right
20312 its learning of it at almost the last minute that i think is destabilizing the international media and certainly embarrassing for me as up till 48 hours ago i was insisting it would be free and uncensored internet access
20313 the truth is that amy ended up in hospital this week because she mixed up the medication shes taking to help her come off drugs
20314 being diagnosed with the early stage of emphysema was a real jolt to her a bit of a wake up call
20315 oh yeah its definitely there you just might not recognize it its a smoking crater now
20316 achieving iso registration was a team effort and kyocera is proud to be a member of the elite group of businesses registered to the iso 9001 standard
20317 with this new global confirmation we are able to reinforce kyoceras 34 year commitment to producing and maintaining quality products for our customers in the photovoltaic industry
20318 being a part of the iso 9001 standard adds to kyoceras distinction as a world class company we will continue to monitor our processes to ensure that we maintain this distinction
20319 we feel that his versatility ability to handle the point guard duties and defensive strength will bolster our depth and provide us with additional options in our backcourt
20320 when i first met his father rod he asked me why i wanted his son
20321 i still have one to this day its not directed at anyone or any team but i have something to prove not to myself but to people who overlooked me
20322 he fought every day in practice every day in individual drills every day in the summer
20323 im high strung i have to control my temper when i see him ill apologize
20324 ive been on two teams that were mediocre i like the makeup of this team they have individuals who are selfless not selfish
20325 a powerhouse of wit and hard learned wisdom as performed by an actor in a rabbit suit
20326 interpretation is everything or almost everything because the ideas of cruelty and compassion remain constant
20327 modern games are about coddling the player so they have fun
20328 we have come together because we cannot and we must not let islam be hijacked by a few those propagating violence hatred and terror this conference is aimed at addressing the most pressing issue for muslims in the world that is conflict conflict and conflict
20329 to promote enduring peace in the muslim world we must start working today for the economic empowerment and the social welfare of our peoples
20330 we cannot tolerate a situation where the great majority of muslims languish in poverty
20331 i have decided i wont run in the kadima movement primaries nor do i intend to intervene in the elections
20332 when a new kadima party chairman is chosen i will resign as prime minister to permit them to put together a new government swiftly and effectively
20333 the only reason kadima is actually holding primaries is because ehud olmert is now seen as a political liability
20334 no surprise then that he is not standing in the leadership primary but clearly he decided to move quickly to remove any remaining doubt and so the party can move towards a leadership election without olmert hanging around the party like a millstone around its neck
20335 i was forced to defend myself against relentless attacks from self appointed fighters for justice who sought to depose me from my position
20336 i will quit my duties in an honourable just and responsible manner as i have acted throughout my mandate
20337 since we want peace and want to negotiate with the israeli government we are not dealing with individuals but the government as a whole
20338 whether he olmert is still the prime minister for two days or two months we will continue to deal with him if someone comes we will deal with them as long as they want to deal with us
20339 but obviously in terms of seeing olmert himself do anything dynamic or far reaching in terms of the international scene the clock is now ticking
20340 we are going to look forward to working with all responsible israeli leaders in the government whether it is this government or future governments
20341 they just put me into a job network but the job network was not helpful it is a possibility people from african backgrounds are not given a chance
20342 uhhh excuse me maam i mean like i know youre the governor and youre as old as my grandma but uhhh could i see your id
20343 just as no player is bigger than a team no team is bigger than a players right to work
20344 then we would have been having a very different debate
20345 the money is being funneled to hunter by a wealthy colleague who was closely tied to the edwards campaign this same man is also shoveling cash to edwards pal and former aide andrew young who tried to take the heat off the ex senator by claiming he is the father of rielles baby
20346 a super rich pal who was closely involved with the campaign finances is helping john its likely this man doesnt know all the dirty details of johns extramarital affair but is acting out of loyalty and is not asking a lot of questions only writing the checks
20347 doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills thats a pathetic excuse for the nyts waiving the bloody shirt of racism over this campaign what obama actually said was so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
20348 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington
20349 there is nothing more to this than the fact that he was describing that he was new to the political scene he was referring to the fact that he didnt come into the race with the history of others it is not about race
20350 modern games are about coddling the player so they have fun
20351 put aside for a moment the fact that schools are just one small input in the equation that yields abysmal school success rates for children affected by poverty
20352 when asked the same questions our corps members respond that the top three factors contributing to low educational outcomes are teacher quality school leadership and expectations of students while societal inequities and poverty create additional challenges for their students it is possible to provide them with educational opportunities that result in a high level of engagement and achievement
20353 closing or substantially narrowing achievement gaps requires combining school improvement with reforms that narrow the vast socioeconomic inequalities in the united states
20354 lies about using testing and accountability to close the achievement gap
20355 westwood was chosen because of the quality of education the focus is on high level skills major universities are more theory based not us we are more hands on
20356 working with these guys in this short phase is just amazing its stuff i would never be able to get my hands on unless ive been in the industry for 10 years
20357 im expecting to learn a lot im willing to learn all i can now i want to get my bachelors degree
20358 nervous at times its a huge event we dont want to mess up or have any mistakes but its exciting to work in a big network and the dnc is huge one of the biggest national events we have
20359 i think its a wonderful opportunity for students to see something that is very rare
20360 we are now confirming that based on our investigation he will not be suspended for conduct that occurred prior to his nfl career
20361 hes been one of the most excited people to be here
20362 hes a happy guy and no matter what you ask him to do whether it is the scout team or special teams whatever it might be hes responded in a positive way to everything
20363 last year the rough here was almost out of control this year the rough is very average and its part of an experiment theyre doing theyre trying to see if the rough height has any effect on scoring
20364 im not saying its playing easy but the rough is not nearly as thick as it was last year
20365 you fall in love with a golf course when you have a setup thats as wonderful as this
20366 the greens are fast the pin placements are great the rough is challenging but fair and it lets you hit some recovery shots this year firestone is one of my favorite golf courses that we have on tour
20367 but when you have two or three of them it just really helps you focus in a little bit more
20368 when we were at offseason workouts i was having a couple of problems just because of my repetition
20369 well i feel that im back to where i was with catching the punts
20370 obviously i love touching the ball you get a little bit more joy when you run back a punt or get a touchdown for the most part i get the same joy on third and 4 when my receiver cant catch the ball
20371 seeing his abilities well coach to what he gives us a chance to do wade was pointing out how very interesting it is when you have a guy that can change direction like that and move around
20372 hi mike i received the sauerkraut maker about a week ago and have completed my first batch of kraut it is the best kraut i have tasted i imagine the freshness has much to do with it i added fresh green cabbage russian kale thyme basil rosemary marjoram sage cayenne turmeric garlic vita mineral green celtic sea salt and pure water it is amazing the prep is easy the device is simple the directions were clear the pictures were helpful could not ask for anything more best raw tool i have came upon in awhile must buy for those seeking the benefits of fermented foods
20373 hey mike i was excited to see the jar arrived on saturday quick delivery i really appreciate all of the help i will definitely recommend your website to everyone i know its been a great experience
20374 hello mike i made my first batch of sauerkraut with your jars i used the miso as you recommended and it turned out amazing it is the best sauerkraut i have tasted thank you
20375 hi mike i love these jars do you have pamphlets i have several people asking about them the kimchee turned out delicious here is my latest i did today i made pickled asparagus with spring water with celtic salt garlic and fresh dill looks yummy
20376 i can really recommend this product as something that is essential to the making of kimchi or sauerkraut i have made my first batch and can only say that i am a very satisfied customer of the raw diet shop
20377 great product support service and shipping a great guy you wont be disappointed
20378 the kimchi came out great mike the directions were dead on it did indeed stop fermenting in a little under 5 days i love this thing and thanks for the info about the probiotics which i intend pursue
20379 thinking back on my recent comments at big east media day i believe that i may have overstated my feelings on college baseball and the wvu baseball program
20380 i have not played collegiate baseball in the past because i have concentrated on football and building on our success with my football family
20381 i am sorry my comments have caused so many distractions i am looking forward to putting this behind me and getting on the practice field with my teammates on saturday
20382 i think i was the first guy off the golf course that day at washington he said
20383 i guess they wanted to get some negative tests in before anything happens i guess they figured im one of the least likely to be on something you have to go to the gym to be on steroids
20384 why why bother you want me to go even more crazy
20385 i hit the ball about as solid as ive hit it in a really long time said dimarco who tied for fourth a year ago in akron
20386 if i hit the next couple of weeks like i hit it today thats not going to be a problem he said
20387 they want skill to play a factor in every single shot
20388 this year firestone is one of my favorite golf courses that we have on tour he said after a 68 that included a circus like birdie 3 from out of the deep rough and trees on the closing hole
20389 last year not so much but this year all the guys are talking about how much they love it because we can play it we can hit shots we can be creative and challenge ourselves with some recoveries like on 18 that wouldnt have been a possibility last year
20390 i didnt need that this year he said with a laugh
20391 missed a lot of short ones and still mustered a 69
20392 jo jo selvf lgelig kan jeg da klare den hansen intet problem
20393 we are going to make a big big difference in the american marketplace
20394 we are ensuring that the products that come into america are safe for consumers and that the regulating agencies have what they need to do their job
20395 toxic chemicals like lead and phthalates have no business in our childrens toys
20396 safety testing and certification for such hazards as powerful magnets before products are sold a ban on lead and phthalates and more will helpfully put an end to the recalls of childrens products and the horror stories that lead to those recalls
20397 the talks will start but we must be very careful i have some personal concerns
20398 turkish cypriots must be very careful there could be peace but it should be fair and lasting
20399 those two concepts must be fulfilled we say this but we dont do this this is very important
20400 if the island is living in peace since the cyprus peace operation in 1974 this is because of the turkish armed forces
20401 the statements made by u s officials that iran must suspend its uranium enrichment program do not deserve any attention and only harm the constructive atmosphere reached during the talks
20402 we believe that rather than making these statements they should seek ways for continued constructive dialogue on a peaceful resolution of the problems
20403 we know that environmental cues are significant in many addictions including tobacco and alcohol and contribute to relapses
20404 this study identifies the specific neuronal process involved and helps explain relapse even after rehabilitative therapy or long term abstinence
20405 these potentiated synapses are persistent regardless of what your new behavior is and because the memory is still maintained it could trigger relapse when the conditions are repeated
20406 this is a clear validation that drug addiction is a life long disease three months for a rat could equal several years in a human although drug taking behaviors may be absent the memory makes relapse not only possible but likely
20407 i take the oil that i already have anyway and when it gets to the point it needs to be replaced i filter it into separate containers and it goes back to the second stage and i filter it to one micron once i get it to one micron i pour it into the gas tank and pour diesel in behind it
20408 the food stamp program itself is in the u s department of agriculture so its not a welfare program
20409 intends to negotiate in good faith to achieve timely and fair contracts for verizon union represented employees our expectation is to negotiate new contracts that will continue to provide leading wage and benefit packages
20410 things are changing our employees arent using that anymore 12 hour shifts change that need so we dont need to subsidize it to the tune of about 300 000 a year anymore when we know there are good alternatives available
20411 just got to look for another job i guess im going to miss the kids and the people
20412 there are alternatives but this is close its a benefit i get a discounted rate because i work for the hospital and every little bit helps in this day and age
20413 we never planned to be a major player in the day care market locally
20414 aiding persons to sell and be in possession of tobacco manufactured in canada that was not packed and was not stamped
20415 the message sent today is that no company is above the law
20416 an invaluable tool for australian emergency service workers especially when searching for injured or lost people in hazardous situations it has the potential to save lives
20417 exact readings of these factors at the location where the personnel are standing can then be provided back to a base station
20418 concerning nobel prizes in this area its only a question of whos next
20419 in a few years clocks will be able to monitor local changes of the earth gravitational potential by using relativity which might help us forecast tsunamis earthquakes or global climate warming
20420 by understanding it we can do new things such as build quantum computers that in the future could store and process far more information than ordinary computers and may outperform them in certain applications e g cracking the encryption commonly used to transmit information electronically
20421 i think our biggest challenge in the coming years is to bring together knowledge and entertainment and the speakers captivated the public here in barcelona
20422 we have clearly conveyed the fascination that the euroquam scientists have for the exciting fundamental phenomena and technological opportunities of ultra cold matter
20423 to an erroneous categorization of mostly elderly and female subjects as having an intermediate stage of a lethal disease
20424 the egfr formulas and the kdoqickd classification system are not yet ready for wider application to screening for ckd in the population as a whole
20425 mass or universal screening is not the purpose of estimated gfr reporting
20426 reporting of estimated gfr is only one tool in attempting to rectify this latter problem
20427 substance abuse varies significantly depending upon the purpose for which these are used for example 28 6 of those drinking alcohol do so to help them get to know a potential sexual partner while 26 2 of those using cocaine take it to make sexual intercourse last longer
20428 those who consume alcohol cannabis cocaine or ecstasy under the age of 16 are likely to have had sexual relations before this age too
20429 the current patterns of drug use among the study participants reflect their number of sexual partners with regular cocaine users in comparison with those who have never taken it being five times more likely to have had five or more sexual partners within the last 12 months or to have paid for sex
20430 prevention experts must be aware of how young people view the relationship between drug use and sexuality there are very few preventive programmes in our country that take this link into consideration
20431 now that we are aware of this link and the associated health risks new programmes and preventive strategies will be needed in addition to further research in the area of drug use and its social psychological and physical links to sexuality based on the real and important experiences of young people themselves
20432 using novel techniques we have identified a key membrane protein thats essential to the defense that m tuberculosis mounts against the acidic environment of immune cells called macrophages without this protein called rv3671c the bacterium becomes vulnerable to acidification and is killed
20433 m tuberculosis does not depend on rv3671c under standard growth conditions in the test tube so it has been overlooked as a candidate drug target
20434 however when m tuberculosis infects the host then the rv3671c protein becomes essential
20435 this is an example of a new class of potential targets for anti infective agents
20436 those that the pathogen only needs in order to survive in the host environment
20437 thats exactly what we sought to do in this research
20438 thats a huge change from standard anti infective research which typically deals with the pathogen simply replicating in culture
20439 in our experiments we wanted to see if biochemical actors would emerge in the infective process that might be inoperative in the usual in vitro setting
20440 as part of this process the phagosome becomes acidic which is thought to contribute to its ability to break down and destroy the pathogen
20441 however m tuberculosis appears to survive the acidification process keeping its own internal ph stable
20442 what we observed was pretty amazing without functioning rv3671c the mutant bacterium was easily destroyed in a low ph environment both in culture and inside the more acidic environment of the macrophage
20443 this revealed a new point of vulnerability for the bacterium
20444 the ability to make those kinds of measurements will expand research into this type of host pathogen interaction
20445 right now we have very little idea of the mechanism at work here perhaps as an enzyme rv3671c cleaves a transcription regulator that then turns on some kind of defensive program within the bacterium only further study will reveal those secrets
20446 what is clear is that by targeting an element involved directly in the infective process we may develop a line of drugs that work in collaboration with rather than in difference to the host environment including host immune responses
20447 hopefully this kind of approach can help solve the ongoing problem of bacterial drug resistance
20448 in the ideal collaboration each participant brings key insights from their particular discipline to the table
20449 up until now its been impossible to get access to the neurons affected by als and although everyone was excited by the potential of the new technology it was uncertain that we would be able to obtain them from patients skin cells
20450 our paper now shows that we can generate hundreds of millions of motor neurons that are genetically identical to a patients own neurons this will be an immense help as we try to uncover the mechanisms behind this disease and screen for drugs that can prolong life
20451 we dont know yet how similar they are to the motor neurons in als patients
20452 while the cells exhibit many properties that are typical of motor neurons we dont yet know whether they will be prone to degeneration that will allow us to mimic the disease in the culture dish and therefore to screen potential drugs
20453 project a l s has always maintained that collaboration between scientists is the answer to understanding and treating this disease
20454 we are thrilled to have catalyzed the harvard columbia collaboration that led to this discovery
20455 therapeutic use of the cells is probably a long way off
20456 right now there are safety issues with ips cells including a risk of cancer we also dont know how to reintroduce cells into a sick adult in a way that will be beneficial all these hurdles need to be overcome first before we can think about using the cells to treat disease but we can start immediately to evaluate them as a tool for drug discovery
20457 my friend and i decided to wait for rescue we dont know if they survived
20458 we spent a lot of time without anything to eat we survived on raw fish and rainwater
20459 they were so weak they could barely lift themselves up
20460 as we went up to them one of them managed to get to his feet and throw himself at my colleague he was crying from happiness the other had a bible in his hand
20461 we couldnt understand anything they said we gave them something to eat and a lot of water
20462 the proxy fight is over and it will not do shareholders or yahoo any good to have the annual meeting turn into a media event for no purpose
20463 while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship

20466 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews
20467 hamas christian convert ive left a society that sanctifies terror
20468 i know that im endangering my life and am even liable to lose my father but i hope that hell understand this and that god will give him and my family patience and willingness to open their eyes to jesus and to christianity maybe one day ill be able to return to palestine and to ramallah with jesus in the kingdom of god
20469 send regards to israel i miss it i respect israel and admire it as a country
20470 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews they believe that tradition says that the prophet mohammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death
20471 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews

20476 our findings suggest that anti pc can be used as a complement to the traditional risk factors to improve diagnosis and treatment in addition we are currently developing anti pc as a vaccine for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease
20477 the latest technology means we can now carry out quantitative analysis of cocaine traces on any bank note and as a result we can confirm that at least in spain traces of the drug are found not only on notes that have been in direct contact with it but on nearly all the notes in circulation
20478 has become rooted in spanish society and is playing russian roulette with the neuronal development of an entire generation
20479 i find it profoundly embarrassing that we now all have cocaine in our wallets
20480 knee pain is one of the most common musculoskeletal complaints that bring people to their doctor
20481 human cartilage injuries heal poorly and can lead to cartilage degeneration and osteoarthritis this is an enormous clinical problem it is estimated that one quarter of the adult population will have some kind of arthritis by 2020
20482 the research we have published is an early but important step in unraveling the important pathways that will facilitate development of new treatments
20483 if we can identify what genes or proteins are necessary for cartilage to heal we can work toward finding similar genes and proteins in humans
20484 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years
20485 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon
20486 thats why i know this is going to work its so easy to implement
20487 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
20488 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
20489 the scientific community is really going to run with this
20490 revolutionary progress in bringing solar energy to its full potential in the energy marketplace
20491 the results of the present study show a marked increase in antiviral effect in patients when ribavirin is added to the combination of r1626 and peginterferon alfa 2a
20492 this phase 2a study has demonstrated a potent reduction in hcv rna by r1626 and high viral responses with up to 74 percent rapid viral response after 4 weeks of treatment the strong antiviral effect between r1626 peginterferon alfa 2a and ribavirin suggests that the dose of one or both of these agents could be lowered to improve tolerability without significantly compromising efficacy
20493 the decreases in hcv rna from baseline observed with r1626 indicates potent antiviral activity and lack of viral load rebound in the significant majority of patients following 14 days of monotherapy
20494 if you understand what is broken you may be able to treat it
20495 a step towards ascertaining the effects of phytoestrogens on developing fetuses and newborns
20496 is organized by hormones during development which is the neonatal stage for rats and during gestation for humans
20497 weve found a framing concept for an important class of materials which allows us to begin to understand how they relate to each other and perhaps to find new members of the group
20498 if breeding a new fruit with a specific trait is like finding a needle in a haystack then mas is like having a metal detector
20499 our breeding programme with zespri generates many thousands of seedlings every year
20500 the genus actinidia to which all kiwifruit belong is incredibly diverse and contains many colours shapes flavours and other attributes beyond the two most prominent industry cultivars the green fleshed hayward and yellow fleshed hort16a better known as zespri gold kiwifruit
20501 hortresearch has a collection of 23 species of kiwifruit and many more can be found in china from where kiwifruit originated were now better placed than ever to unlock some of that natural resource and deliver it to consumers
20502 the work involved in identifying these ests plus research that has been done to investigate their use in ongoing breeding programmes proves new zealands world leadership status in kiwifruit science
20503 hortresearch breeds kiwifruit exclusively for zespri and the new zealand kiwifruit industry it is a relationship that has already seen the breeding and highly successful commercialisation of zespri gold kiwifruit and now looks poised to deliver more exciting fruit to the marketplace
20504 this science is a great fit with our natural breeding strategy which is committed to delivering high quality all natural kiwifruit that offer consumers health convenience pleasure and a guarantee of 100 natural goodness
20505 this new molecular insight into kiwifruit coupled with time honored breeding techniques offers the perfect combination of innovation and tradition while ensuring customers that zespri kiwifruit really are natures best
20506 males will act as if their desired mate is near and start blindly feeling around to locate it
20507 when worm larvae are stressed out and hungry and crowded
20508 the dauer stage is important because it is the infective stage in a lot of parasitic nematodes
20509 this is the first glimpse into the chemical code that nematodes are using to communicate
20510 it is the first time that two distinct and different life history traits reproduction and developmental arrest have been found to be regulated by the same family of molecules suggesting a link which we had not suspected between the corresponding pathways
20511 that interfere with the chemical signaling involved in the reproductive process
20512 a blend of small molecules regulates both mating and development in caenorhabditis elegans
20513 we wanted to know whether a drug specific for ppar delta would have the same beneficial effects
20514 genetic engineering in humans commonly known as gene doping when mentioned in connection with athletic performance is certainly feasible but very impractical
20515 we got the expected benefits in lowering fatty acids and blood glucose levels but no effect absolutely none on exercise performance
20516 that led us to consider whether ampk activation was the critical trigger that allowed ppar delta to work
20517 it essentially puts a turbo charge on ppar delta which explains why exercise is so important
20518 thats as much improvement as we get with regular exercise
20519 its the first study ive done in this field and the results are astounding they indicate a very strong correlation between this type of social factor and the risk of developing dementia
20520 this suggests two influencing factors social and intellectual stimulation and trauma
20521 in practice it shows how important it is to put resources into helping people who have undergone a crisis if our interpretation will hold such an intervention strategy could also be profitable for society considering the costs for dementia care
20522 does it matter for instance if the relationship is a happy one or not and does it matter if someone has always intended to live a single life or not
20523 this general picture of star formation and the ability to compare how stellar objects form in different time periods and regions of the universe will eventually allow investigation into the origins of life and planets
20524 the abundance of elements in the universe has increased as stars have accumulated
20525 and the formation and destruction of stars continues to spread these elements further across the universe so when you think about it all of the elements in our bodies originally formed from nuclear reactions in the centers of stars long ago
20526 dr yoshida has taken the study of primordial star formation to a new level with this simulation but it still gets us only to the halfway point towards our final goal it is like laying the foundation of a skyscraper
20527 we must continue our studies in this area to understand how the initially tiny protostar grows layer by layer to eventually form a massive star but here the physics become much more complicated and even more computational resources are needed
20528 when one of these rare genetic variations is present in a person the result is a moderate to large increase in disease risk in a study lead by dr michael odonovan from cardiff university we also found other relatively frequent variations that slightly increase a persons risk our results could make a significant contribution to the further research concerning the causes of schizophrenia as well as the development of diagnostic tests and possibly treatment
20529 persons affected with the illness however may exhibit changes in thought and behavior
20530 hallucinations or delusions are only a few of the potential symptoms of this severe mental illness
20531 there are presumably several genetic factors working together each of which only has a very small effect on disease risk or which occur very rarely and have a moderate to strong effect
20532 for this reason the field of schizophrenia genetics should be concerned with identifying these so called risk genes we have certainly made an important leap in the search for genetic factors yet there is not a single schizophrenia gene but rather only genetic variations that can increase or decrease ones susceptibility to the illness
20533 altogether a great number of institutes took part in both studies
20534 we would never have been able to achieve the enormous sample size otherwise and were therefore able to find associations between the genetic variations and the illness without regional or national differences what is also particularly interesting here is that there are clearly different mechanisms that come into play for example we have found rare genetic variations that have a major influence but we have also found frequent genetic variations that have only a minor effect on the disease risk
20535 the test is a measure of long term glucose control but doctors dont typically use it to screen for or diagnose the disease
20536 theres reason to believe it could help identify many of the estimated six million people in the u s who have diabetes but dont know it
20537 if a patient is scheduled for a physical he or she may tune up by changing their regimen for a few days and throw off their test results causing doctors to miss the patients usual pattern of high blood sugar
20538 could greatly enhance how well were able to identify people with diabetes
20539 surface potentials and layer charge distributions in few layer graphene films
20540 who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and treated others with contempt
20541 this is not a condition that kills you acutely it is a condition that erodes your health over time
20542 it will certainly be a list that no college or university president will want to be on
20543 however if they are on it my guess is they will have very good explanations for why for example big budget cuts for state appropriations

20545 dino rossi hates trees clean water and small furry animals
20546 it was all kind of a surprise that they are moving so quickly
20547 managed care has a mixed history for people with chronic illnesses and there ought to be a full discussion of quality of care issues
20548 im concerned about how this relates to the governors talk about the fiscal position of the state im sympathetic but it shouldnt come at the expense of our clients
20549 policy makers address the lack of adequate housing as a barrier to effective hiv prevention treatment and care and that all governments fund and develop housing as a response to the aids pandemic
20550 its not just wealthy countries like the u s that can address homelessness among people with aids this is an issue that demands global action
20551 my major concerns continue to be the lack of robust conversation within this board on this 1 5 billion budget
20552 the superintendent has left the door open conservatively to the point where we might revisit this situation again
20553 i see no reason to reject or not support the budget at this time
20554 dr browder has said over and over we have a balanced budget
20555 im not going to support something thats balanced on the backs of our teachers and support people
20556 theres no plan from the superintendent long term on how this is going to impact schools we seem to be dead in the water as a school board at this point no movement just platitudes our employees need us and our students need us we need action not words
20557 you just believe in yourself and all things are possible
20558 im very happy with the privilege of having this computer
20559 i give god and my parents thanks for helping me get it
20560 ive known tom robbins youre probably in good company but if theyve read rimbauds work well hang on to that person
20561 what fargo north dakota was fifth are you joking fargo that ice covered wilderness they made a movie about the one where william macy as bungling criminal jerry lundegaard and frances mcdormand as pregnant police chief marge gunderson donned earflap equipped lumberjack hats and ran around in sub zero weather that fargo beat us thats crazy talk
20562 how in the name of gators golf and grouper sandwiches did you rate fargo ahead of us
20563 the studys emphasis was on health and medical issues fargo is very good in its affordability of health care teaching hospitals exercise and healthy activities by the people there
20564 one other downside for naples marco was the high cost of housing there its a really great place to live but its expensive
20565 if we were only looking at paradise towns naples marco would have been much higher on the list but being in the top 10 is pretty good right

20568 we are writing to express our concern that you have used much of your record profits in recent years to buy back your own stock to enrich the value of your share price rather than invest in oil exploration or production here in the u s or in the research and development of alternative energy sources that are demanded by u s consumers
20569 given todays strong market incentive for expanding exploration and production we can only believe that reinvesting your vast profits into the production of more oil and natural gas in the united states is a profitable strategy that will help our country increase its dependence on foreign oil
20570 and not that energy efficient the co2 emissions it avoids by not producing those imports are higher than the emissions that may have actually been produced delivering those imports
20571 somewhere in the ballpark of 10 percent of u s emissions
20572 this puts many projects on hold just when we were building a wind manufacturing infrastructure in this country
20573 its deeply disappointing and hard to fathom that congress cant get this done especially when 90 percent of congress supports this

20588 one of the things that seems to be particularly aggravating about this situation is that this is a situation that went on for years

20593 relax we now know what happened of course it could have been something else
20594 we scornfully reject the claims that our son took his own life he was a kindhearted and happy person he had a family and there was no reason for him to do such a horrible thing
20595 he had a family he had friends he had plans for the future and had no reason to commit suicide
20596 he was found dead with his head in a bucket of water
20597 i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope
20598 a black man in the position of president they would kill him
20599 she had one white paper file box that she told me had some important paper with her and then she just kind of raised her eyebrows like youre supposed to think oh yeah thats all the information that she had on her business in washington
20600 we are not your problem your problems are our problems the palestinians are the problem
20601 simply arrogant with the idea that there is little we can do
20602 its nonsense for anyone to now try to suggest that bono died after crashing into a tree theres zero evidence in this autopsy report to show such an accident happened instead theres powerful proof he was assassinated
20603 this was an evil plot that was carried out to almost perfection by ruthless assassins
20604 he would have someone follow him back drive him off the road and bury his body somewhere in the desert
20605 those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable
20606 i have some information to share with you about the kennedy assassination
20607 at this time there is no suspicion of foul play
20608 it is redacted s belief that somehow or other martin luther king must be removed from the leadership of the negro movement and is removal must come from within and not from without redacted feels that somewhere in the negro movement at the top there must be a negro leader who is clean who could step into the vacuum and chaos if martin luther king were either exposed or assassinated
20609 a comparison was conducted of the bullet material removed from dr king with the 12 test bullets that could be adequately analyzed
20610 this comparison revealed that the gross and unique characteristic signature left on the 12 test bullets by the james earl ray rifle was not present on the death bullet
20611 after the shooting and blast a few hand guns were located in the crime blast area
20612 the government comes up with the most bizarre dangerous nonsense and it indicates that they are abdicating themselves of all responsibility by saying that she may have knocked her head or concussed her head against one of the levers on the sunroof
20613 no really it was terrorists who did it honest no kidding really
20614 why when nixons re election was a study in foregone conclusions was it necessary to break into the dnc headquarters at the watergate
20615 a profoundly decent man a man of principle a man of conscience
20616 conspiracy theories abound regarding the kennedy assassination however a new well written and documented book sites compelling evidence that the israel s mossad and david ben gurion were behind the assassination the reason kennedys disagreement with ben gurions nuclear program
20617 what the book does say is that when new orleans district attorney jim garrison charged businessman clay shaw with participation in the jfk assassination conspiracy garrison stumbled upon the israeli mossad connection to the murder of president kennedy shaw served on the board of a shadowy corporation known as permindex a primary shareholder in permindex was the banque de credit international of geneva founded by tibor rosenbaum an arms procurer and financier for the mossad
20618 its what we say it is and damn the actual facts
20619 bobby kennedy died believing his brothers killers had not been found
20620 in the back twelve times no really he did he was really depressed
20621 i am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that dr david kellys death could not be suicide
20622 the medical evidence does not support it and david kellys state of mind and personality suggests otherwise
20623 actually kennedy jr s on board hes uh they want to know uh where he is
20624 the french are in possession of this black box and we are asking them to give it back to us to identify the people behind this attack charged murigande during a radio televised debate on the matter in kigali tuesday
20625 well an old lady had died there and sheikh pierre was coming here to express his condolences to the family
20626 al hariri s assassination provides the raison d tre for severing ties with syria and for transforming lebanon into a us vassal
20627 this conforms nicely with israel s ambition to surround itself with non threatening states as well as affording access to the vital water resources of lebanon s wazzani river in other words the murder of al hariri has created some extremely fortunate opportunities for both israel and the us merging seamlessly with their overall objectives in the region
20628 there could have been two bullets but the lead composition data shows there could be anywhere from one to five bullets
20629 but i have gone over in my mind the two conversations we had and he certainly did not betray to me any impression that he was anything other than tired
20630 he certainly did not convey to me that he was feeling depressed and absolutely nothing that would have alerted me to the fact that he may have been considering suicide
20631 this is staged if i did work this sloppy i wouldnt be working
20632 what we do know is that this is the cause of death and you cant say that it was really a case of natural death
20633 if you dont let us gun down innocent bystanders the terrorists will win
20634 the dutch authorities were called immediately after conducting an investigation they confirmed that the cause of death was suicide
20635 they left for australia from beirut airport a few hours after the attack traces of tnt powder were found on the seats some of them had occupied
20636 under various contract umbrellas including counter narcotics and counter insurgency
20637 gretta duisenberg say themselves have disturbed to the communications which to the french authorities sunday without consultation with the family to outside have brought
20638 the autumn months are never a calm time in america there is always a rash of kidnapping and abductions of schoolchildren in the football months preteens of both sexes are traditionally seized and grabbed off the streets by gangs of organized perverts who traditionally give them as christmas gifts to each other to be personal sex slaves and playthings
20639 seven hundred meters more and we are in the airport and we will be safe and in the same moment american soldiers started the shooting
20640 its unfortunate that she was released she didnt deserve the faith and honor that was given to her in the death of an italian intelligence officer she is supporting the animals that took her hostage and shes using the death of a fellow countryman to help push her cause its disgusting
20641 i mean just think about it the guys are sitting there in their armoured vehicle their fingers on the firing button and this car drives up with a sign in the windows that says press
20642 from an armoured vehicle rather than calling immediately for assistance for the wounded italians the soldiers first move was to confiscate their weapons and mobile phones and they were prevented from resuming contact with rome for more than an hour
20643 it is clear that his enquiry cannot be conducted just by the us army which in the past especially in the case of the palestine hotel shooting that killed two journalists produced reports aimed solely at exonerating the military
20644 we demand to know the full truth about this distressing affair
20645 giuliana had information and the us military did not want her to survive
20646 the us soldiers prevented first aid for several minutes and prevented anyone from coming near the car
20647 giuliana had had information that the usa wouldnt let her return home alive the government must cast light on what happened and the usa must have the courage to say that in iraq we are in the hands of teenagers
20648 our investigation has shown that it was iraqi insurgents aided by lebanese and syrian al qaeda marxist gay pro abortion atheists who attacked ms sgrenas vehicle our heroic soldiers may have appared to have been firing at her car but were in reality trying to shoot through her car to attack the insurgents these things can happen in war you know but we are blameless
20649 it was not a checkpoint but a patrol that fired after having shone a floodlight at us
20650 giuliana had information and the us military did not want her to survive
20651 i think a bullet from the magazine should have cycled into the chamber but if theres a malfunction they may not
20652 the bomb was placed underground especially since the crater was so huge
20653 even a car with 1 000 kilograms 2 200 pounds of tnt wouldnt create such a crater
20654 the question is who stands to benefit from his death syrias enemies i think death is part of the plan to divide the region into tiny helpless sectarian states this plan has started in iraq and it will continue to hit all other arab countries
20655 this is the work of an intelligence service not a small group
20656 and something bad will happen to anyone who says we are
20657 honest gary webb shot himself in the head with a 38 and perfectionist that he is picked that danged gun up and shot hisself a second time
20658 there is no room for arafat among us and the time will come when we will remove him and that day is closer than ever
20659 the most efficient accident in simple assassination is a fall of 75 feet or more onto a hard surface
20660 it will usually be necessary to stun or drug the subject before dropping him
20661 al kaydee gonna getcha if you dont love the war
20662 robin is one of the most rational and respected men you will ever meet
20663 fire and ice searching for the truth behind the cold fusion furor
20664 suicide no really he was really really depressed about testifying against the cias good buddy very depressed he was doing all kinds of suicide type stuff all last week i saw him no fooling wet his nose and stuck it in the lamp socket walked into a hells angels bar and screamed all you pussy bikers suck yep suicide sure enough
20665 we are satisfied that lee harvey oswald shot him from the 6th floor ummm wait a moment
20666 according to rick wahlberg then st louis county sheriff a team of fbi agents was quickly on the crash site about noon less than an hour after assistant manager gary ulman and the fire chief had first located the site and found a way to access the wreck this fbi team had come from the distant twin cities in record time
20667 asked ulman if he had notified the fbi about the accident ulman said he had not spoken with the bureau at any time asked how the fbi got to the site so quickly ulman said that he assumed they had come from duluth afp contacted the duluth office of the fbi and was told that the team of recovery agents had not come from duluth but had traveled from the fbi office in minneapolis
20668 i calculate that this team would have had to have left the twin cities at about the same time the wellstone plane was taking off
20669 before he can rat us out for all the weapons we gave him
20670 i was born about 10 years after his death i feel it is about time that we are given the right to know the real truth behind his assassination once and for all
20671 the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race
20672 well just keep it on the down low and say yeah its the sand dunes right over there on the outer banks
20673 todays destination lies just west of three affiliated tribes museum and reconstructed earth lodge village right now were going to go inside and talk to our friend marilyn whos going to tell us a little more
20674 the museum offers a lot of information artifacts bits of history of the history and culture of the three affiliated tribes and the three affiliated tribes are the mandan hidatsa and the arikara people
20675 as you know most museums have a reputation of being a rather old place were there are just dusty relics sitting on a shelf so we try to keep pace with the progression of our tribes as well
20676 they were constructed entirely by balance so its a system of balance in keeping this very large round structure in place for probably 10 15 years what you see at the new earth lodge village up there is certainly not going to be in any sense exactly a replica of those original villages theyre going to be like i say 21st century improved
20677 no its not dick cheneys doctrine is if there is a 1 chance of something happening we should act as if it will definitely happen
20678 regardless its pretty silly to criticize reagan for saying his policies could have led to nuclear war they didnt and in fact the cold war ended soon after his presidency
20679 that still gives a very good chance that reaganism will work out 97 percent is good odds but still probably means that the reagan option is a bad idea
20680 picking a fight with the soviet union is too dangerous in a nuclear world
20681 2 both germany and japan were mere miles from the
20682 in the face of uncertainty lets assign non zero probability to some but not all worst case scenarios
20683 i dont know how you can say that in retrospect nuclear freeze was wrong
20684 air bursts generate much less dust and fallout etc than do ground bursts
20685 under what possible scenarios would global warming kill billions of people
20686 so then you get a firestorm with associated high winds and lots of smoke being sent high in the atmosphere you could do the same thing with lots and lots of 1940s low tech incendiary bombs as at dresden
20687 i dont think ordinary fires and or even firestorms have the necessary energy to throw smoke that high
20688 smoke from non nuclear fires doesnt travel as high because it disperses cools in the lower
20689 say that under jimmy carters policies there would have been a one percent chance of a nuclear war in the 1981 84 period whereas under reagans more aggressive policies there was a three percent chance of such a war that still gives a very good chance that reaganism will work out 97 percent is good odds but still probably means that the reagan option is a bad idea
20690 however the fires generate by the explosion take several hours to fully develop hence the injection height of the smoke is controlled by the energy release from the burning fuel not from the nuclear explosion the energy released in a fire initiated by a nuclear explosion is much greater than that released by the explosion itself the energy release from the hiroshima fires would have been about 3x10 16j this is more than 1000 times greater than the energy release from the atomic explosion
20691 on the question of global climate effects from the firebombing of japan there are some data which show a postwar drop in average sea temperature
20692 youre treating probability estimates that at this point represent little more than educated guesses as if they were empirical facts
20693 published 1977 thats 31 years ago theres a lot of progress in climate modelling since then
20694 the data relating to the magnitude and effects of future climate change is still very limited
20695 i cited glasstone because we dont detonate ground burst 10 megaton nukes anymore and then actually measure how high the cloud goes
20696 no it will likely get much better over time as scientists collect more data about how the climate changes in response to changes in ghg concentrations and how other aspects of the environment change in response to changes in climate
20697 read the damm paper forest fires can put smoke into the stratosphere recent modelling and computational fluid dynamics is way better than it was in 1977 indicates that firestorms can do it too
20698 actually your cited paper indicates that most of the smoke would be limited to the troposphere
20699 the estimate that the hiroshima firestorm released 1000 times as much energy as the original bomb should surely indicate that your focus on the location and size of the detonation is missing the point completely
20700 well get more and more knowledge about what happens when theres a lot of co2 the more we study it period well get more and more knowledge from further study even if we stopped emitting any more co2 tomorrow
20701 yes it might and there might be a nuclear war next year there might be a huge asteroid impact there might be a global disease pandemic merely pointing out that a catastrophic event or outcome is possible doesnt tell us anything useful about how to respond to that possibility
20702 within the next 50 years theres an x probability of an impact by an asteroid of diameter greater than ykm
20703 scientists estimate that we have at best 10 years to bring down global carbon emissions if we are to stabilise world temperatures within two degrees of their present levels
20704 no its not a 1 megaton nudet injects debris into the stratosphere because an intensely hot fireball carries debris rapidly upward similar to a bubble rising in water
20705 conventional fires by contrasting slowly emit much cooler smoke into the troposphere where it is rapidly and constantly dissipated including by rainfall kinda like a squid leaking ink into water
20706 for the paper i cited they ran models and showed that large firestorms in the tropics can do it
20707 in the post immediately preceding that to mixner you indicate that a tropical firestorm in the amazon would cause massive global warming which is it
20708 within the next 50 years theres an x probability of an impact by an asteroid of diameter greater than ykm
20709 then your claim is simply false because there is no scientific consensus that the outcomes you list are
20710 you keep pretending that all probability estimates are educated guesses theyre not
20711 as i said the reliability of some probability estimates is much better than others because our knowledge and understanding of some phenomena is much better than others
20712 and rsh please try to remember youre not a transhuman yet
20713 our organization was startled to learn more than 70 percent of young adults in the twin cities are multitasking even text messaging and dialing cell phone numbers while theyre driving
20714 aaa minneapolis supports minnesotas new state law prohibiting text messaging while driving which goes into effect on august 1 but clearly the crisis of distracted driving which leads to hundreds of traffic crashes and driving deaths each year is a big issue in the twin cities which includes text messaging while on the road
20715 given that the national highway traffic safety administration and virginia tech transportation institute have determined that 80 percent of crashes and 65 percent of near crashes involve some form of driver distraction from using a cell phone to applying make up and reading
20716 the high growth areas in which we do business have borne the brunt of the collapsing real estate prices
20717 there is a domino reaction with slowing employment and the declining wealth effect has created anxiety far beyond our borders

20722 possibly the greatest long term effect was also the most ironic halfway through the war japan replaced the united states as the leading economic power in southeast asia so that one of americas most reluctant allies ended up as the chief beneficiary of the eight year war to save the saigon regime

20811 all over asia there are now epidemics of hiv in men who have sex with men at the same magnitude that we saw in this country 25 years ago that is something that has been detected fairly recently there is not enough action yet but we are now starting programs
20812 asia has recognized populations of men who have sex with men for quite some time
20813 the epidemic in these populations started in the mid 1990s what we see now is a resurgence
20814 there are countries where the percentage of people infected are similar to what we were seeing in san francisco or in berlin or in london where up to 15 to 20 percent of men who have sex with men are hiv positive
20815 potentially significant but under researched aspect of the hiv epidemics in asia
20816 recent study data from several major cities in the region from bangkok to ho chi minh city show increasing hiv prevalence among men who have sex with men
20817 even without blatant national laws that criminalize homosexual behavior you can still have a gradation of policies and practices that can be almost as bad

20824 in her second novel langan delivers a powerhouse creepfest that recalls in the best way possible the early work of stephen king corpus christi maine was once a town of affluence but since the mysterious paper mill fire in the neighboring town of bedford depicted in last years well received debut the keeper released dense sulfuric clouds that killed the surrounding forest corpus christi has been in steady decline when fourth grade teacher lois larkin takes her class on a field trip to the now abandoned bedford theyre exposed to a deadly virus that transforms the infected into ravenous flesh eating monsters rather than stick to zombie lit convention mindless undead endless chases langan invests her plague with a sinister intelligence of unknown origin maintaining a skin crawling tension as the vivid cast of characters succumb to murderous insanity hunting down and tearing apart animals neighbors and loved ones langan has the control of a pro parsing just enough horrific details to allow the truly gruesome scenes to play out unbound in the imagination this solid sophomore effort proves that the keeper s disturbing ability to burrow into readers heads and stay there was no fluke

20836 this legislation will ensure that unaccompanied children receive humane and appropriate treatment while in the custody of the united states government
20837 it would give unaccompanied minors access to pro bono legal counsel and someone to look after their best interest ive been working on this legislation for seven years it is time for it to become law
20838 media reports and consumer advocates have called this bill the most important piece of consumer product safety legislation in a generation
20839 the commission is responsible for ensuring that the more than 15 000 products everything from infant cribs to all terrain vehicles are safe to use
20840 i am very pleased that many of the key provisions which originated in the senate such as the searchable database whistleblower protection phthalates restrictions mandatory toy safety standards and all terrain vehicle safety standards were included in the final bill
20841 several of these initiatives faced significant initial opposition from the administration industry and indeed from the chair of the commission itself and i am pleased that we have come together in the house and the senate to overcome these challenges
20842 reconciling the differences between the house and the senate was no easy task but i had no doubts that the work of the committee would come to a timely and successful conclusion
20843 his stewardship and attention to the details of this bill were essential to negotiating the conference report with the house
20844 i would also like to recognize several senators who were not conferees for their contributions to the original senate amendment and for working with the conference committee on the provisions they championed in the senate
20845 senator mccaskills work on the whistleblower and the inspector general provisions helped convince the conferees to provide whistleblower protections to millions of workers in the consumer products sector
20846 my friend congressman john dingell the chairman of the house energy and commerce committee has shown his legislative skill and care for the american people for more than fifty years
20847 the conference committee staff have labored on a nonstop basis since may
20848 this bill is a major victory for wyomings students and their families because it will significantly improve higher education affordability access and accountability whether youre a traditional student right out of high school a parent going back to school or a worker seeking to boost your credentials this legislation will help you
20849 the knowledge and skills required to succeed in todays ever evolving increasingly high tech workplace have significantly changed and american workers need to be prepared the economic security of wyoming and our entire country relies upon how well we bridge the gap between the occupations of yesterday and the careers of the future the higher education opportunity act will help us to get there by providing our students with access to affordable higher education
20850 students will have better access than ever to important information about the costs of achieving their higher education goals allowing them to make sound financial decisions for their futures
20851 that 14 page form was intended to make it easier for students to attend college by assisting with financial aid but it was far more of a hindrance than a help fafsa had become just another example of our red tape laden bureaucracy and this bill changes that by tackling the complexity of the federal student aid system now it will only take three quick pages to help many students get the financial assistance they need to pursue their educational dreams
20852 non traditional and community college students have improved options for funding their educations this bill recognizes that not every student chooses to attend a four year university
20853 congress has now passed legislation that will help further protect american consumers especially children from dangerous products by increasing enforcement emphasizing research and development and imposing stiffer penalties on offenders
20854 every person and company along the supply chain has a responsibility to ensure the safety of consumer products parents however diligent do not have the facilities to test and analyze the content of the many products which are aimed specifically at children that duty falls to the consumer products safety commission
20855 todays action sends a clear message that improving college opportunities for the nations students and families is again a top priority for congress last year we passed the largest increase in college aid since the g i bill earlier this summer we made sure that students can get federal loans despite turbulence in the credit markets and now were enacting sweeping higher education reform that tackles skyrocketing costs simplifies college aid reins in abuses by lenders helps the troops and gives intellectually disabled students a chance
20856 im enormously grateful to senator barbara mikulski for her leadership in getting this legislation across the finish line
20857 heck i cant blame him im not going to say that he cant
20858 ive always been one to follow my gut and follow my heart with decisions and when ive done that things have worked out pretty darn good for me
20859 my gut was telling me that this wasnt the right situation
20860 i still have a great passion for the game of football
20861 i still very much love it in my heart i still feel like i can compete at a pro bowl level but the situation is going to have to be right im not going to just play for any team or any situation
20862 ill be rooting for john as long as hes not in the afc west
20863 if he is ill be rooting for him as a person just not in the games we play
20864 but i understand how competitive he is and how much pride he has about what he does on the field
20865 john will go on and continue to have much success im sure if he wants to play he can still play at a high level
20866 john came up to me and said mike if the season started today where do you see me
20867 he came back to me and said im a guy thats really got to be involved
20868 i dont think ive ever been with more of a pro than a guy like john lynch
20869 hes the type of guy that you look at in the future and say could this guy be the president of the united states hes that type of guy i felt like i owed it to him to look at his options football retirement whatever he wants to do
20870 he didnt go to all those pro bowls just because they liked him
20871 hes a player and im sure he can fit in somewhere
20872 if you poll all the starting safeties in the nfl i guarantee theyre going to mention john lynch as one of the top five safeties of all time
20873 tonight congress sent a message to women across the country your work is valued
20874 the purpose of this amendment is to kill this bill it says to the woman who makes 77 cents to drive a truck when a man makes 1 wait your turn if you want our sisters and our mothers and our daughters to wait their turn vote for this motion to recommit but if you believe as we do the time is now vote down this motion to recommit vote for this bill and vote for justice for the working women in this country

20887 we signed molina obviously to be a backup catcher and hes one of the premier backups in the game today
20888 he stepped up and did a tremendous job here to hold the fort down while we were going through our stuff with jorgie
20889 there were things i was not comfortable with its a sellers market if you want to meet the sales price then obviously you can get a deal but i wasnt willing to do that
20890 im ready to rock n roll if we could match up with somebody we just couldnt match value for value in the marketplace
20891 heck i cant blame him im not going to say that he cant
20892 ive always been one to follow my gut and follow my heart with decisions and when ive done that things have worked out pretty darn good for me

20911 that said these statistics are still teaching us things and we need to constantly be looking at how we use force
20912 i am pleasantly surprised at the low number of times the officers used force
20913 we need to remember that the chief is doing this so he can see if there are areas to improve in
20914 he is doing that on his own initiative and i appreciate that
20915 this is the police department making its own best case and it is self serving and one sided as one would expect
20916 if i were chief of police in san jose and i heard my officers never used deadly force once it would be a headline

20925 you got up early in the morning and cleaned house and there was a doctor and his wife
20926 they had a little girl i had to feed her and be very quiet so i didn t wake up the doctor s wife and give her breakfast and then when it was time for me to go to school i d knock on her door and the little girl would go into her room and then when i came home if i was more than five minutes late i was reprimanded and then every night i would have to clean thoroughly a different room and then when i was all done with my work then i could do my homework

20950 as it is becoming clearer that the impediments to womens participation in the legal profession are not confined to those that block the door but include patterns of behaviour and work which women do not accept or cannot meet strategies for overcoming these impediments may collide with legal culture or give rise to fears that women are to receive advantages

20955 if we are too apologetic about globalisation we can feed core irrationalities instead of taming them the risk is that we will frame trade as a fundamental source of suffering and losses which would make voters more nervous not less it is wrong to play down the costs of globalisation but the reality is that weve been playing down its benefits for a long time politicians already pander to americans suspicion of foreigners there is no need for the rest of us to jump on this bandwagon instead we need more awareness of the cosmopolitan benefits of trade and the often hidden but no less real gains for ordinary americans

21115 its a megabowl whats not to understand this is history in the making youre gonna wanna tell your grandkids and their grandkids and their grandkids and when they look back in the annals of history theyre gonna be talking about three things discovery of fire invention of the submarine and the flint michigan megabowl

21120 the trophys 12 feet high and its glorious ive seen it
21121 yeah i dont feel good about this i may not have brought enough scotch
21122 this is easilly the worst half of basketball the tropics have played since monix took over as coach
21123 yeah i dont know why dick but i just got an erection
21124 look jackie people cant just go flyin in the air like that
21125 shes an angel heaven wants us to win this game ill burn your house down
21126 hold it hold it hold it it cant be a foul without touchin another player and it cant be traveling without first establishing a pivot foot
21127 yeah i dont know why dick but i just got an erection
21128 look jackie people cant just go flyin in the air like that
21129 shes an angel heaven wants us to win this game ill burn your house down
21130 hold it hold it hold it it cant be a foul without touchin another player and it cant be traveling without first establishing a pivot foot
21131 there it is again clarence leaping and forcing the ball in a downward direction through the net off of a high arching poss
21132 it sure is oh hold on im just being told that this is called an alley oop yes that is easier to say
21133 monix passes to jackie jackie lobs to clarence and then yes another alley oop the spurs dont know whts hit em
21134 in all my years of radio ive never seen anything like this the tropics have fought their way back from a huge deficit and now with 12 seconds left in the history of this franchise they are down by two and man you can feel the tension
21135 dont worry guys i got these im very good at free throws seriously free throws are probably the best facet of my game
21136 jackie moon holding the fate of flint in his fingertips he kisses the ball for good luck
21137 yesss it was it was wonderful more wonderful than i thought sex could ever be
21138 i find that hard to believe you are the most exciting woman i have ever been with
21139 seven years chris replied how long have you been married
21140 chris i think that was a round about way of asking how old i am
21141 no not at all its just that i think you could be that uhhh well what i mean to say is uhhh
21142 whew i think i better throw another log on the fire i think we are going to need it
21143 it would have been interesting if we did get him because i wanted to see if we made him cut his hair
21144 i think a lot of times when guys are hitting 50 homers a year you kind of theres a special group of athletes who they have their own set of ways
21145 a lot of time in this nature of the business you just got to roll your eyes and go the other way guys like that when theyre happy everybody on the team is happy and the fans are happy when they get disgruntled and are not playing well and get in their moods then everything changes
21146 i think i was the first guy off the golf course that day at washington
21147 i guess they wanted to get some negative tests in before anything happens i guess they figured im one of the least likely to be on something you have to go to the gym to be on steroids
21148 why why bother you want me to go even more crazy
21149 i hit the ball about as solid as ive hit it in a really long time
21150 if i hit the next couple of weeks like i hit it today thats not going to be a problem
21151 they want skill to play a factor in every single shot and if you have rough like you have out here today it takes a lot of skill to maneuver a ball on the green when youve got trees in front of you but you can do it if you hit a really good shot i think the players really like what they see here
21152 this year firestone is one of my favorite golf courses that we have on tour
21153 last year not so much but this year all the guys are talking about how much they love it because we can play it we can hit shots we can be creative and challenge ourselves with some recoveries like on 18 that wouldnt have been a possibility last year
21154 i do think if other companies do what were doing in wi fi that you could envision a world where you wouldnt need cellular service
21155 the sheer speed and size of the verizon network nationally which includes long island and 200 countries around the world makes a statement like that a bit silly
21156 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
21157 when he was attacking him he was calm like he was at the beach
21158 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
21159 was cutting his head off and pretty much gutting him
21160 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
21161 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic
21162 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
21163 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting
21164 he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal
21165 never before in an election cycle has so much attention turned to the youth vote and luke will bring a unique perspective to covering it
21166 as a whole i probably feel better than he did entering last season
21167 well be able to make a good group out of what we have and have some support people
21168 the rest of it was in place now the support cast i didnt feel as good about last year as i do this year its a different thing
21169 last year i was zeroed in on one thing left tackle and then i was worried about support depth along the line
21170 the other parts are more uncertain because left guard ryan liljas hurt and i have to find a right guard but im probably in a little better shape than a year ago
21171 i like all three of them theyre doing well theyre making progress and they seem less lost which is good that means theyre learning what to do and how to do it and when to do it for the most part they still mess things up but one thing i like about them is theyre not hanging on the edge
21172 when they dont do something right theyre not hanging right there and getting down and staying down that impedes progress they seem to be able to get rid of it and get on with life
21173 were going to have injuries if we dont its fabulous but if we have injuries and somebodys missing this gives us more choice to solve the problem
21174 we needed to get players to help us fill in the system of drafting and picking the guys we want and those kinds of things is working as well thats the theory of it sometimes it doesnt always work and to see it working theres a lot of comfort in that
21175 stuff thats foreign to them fundamentally in may if we take a little break and all of a sudden the light starts going on in different places and they can apply it then you feel better about it and thats whats happened for the new guys who have come in its making sense
21176 mr huff has not been in employment since the early 1980s when he suffered a heart attack
21177 i have a duty to protect the public from predators because thats what you are such as you
21178 because of the gravity of the crimes which you have committed a custodial sentence is the only appropriate disposal
21179 i am anxious to ensure that the public is protected from serious harm from you when you are eventually released and am going to pass an extended sentence of nine years
21180 its a good move for me i was down on trial for a couple of weeks and i was happy to get the chance to sign
21181 i was at alloa but they only contacted me after i had signed for dumbarton berwick and a couple of junior teams were also interested but sons were the ones who stood out
21182 they have a team capable of challenging for promotion against st mirren and hamilton last week they did not look out of place and they did really well at airdrie in the first half
21183 i thought i played well against hamilton last week so ive shown the manager i can play at first team level
21184 ive worked with david mcewan at hamilton hes a good keeper and gives you advice so its good to be teammates again
21185 he had been at a party and gone back to his house he had a disagreement with his partner about the dog
21186 he used the car to go to the park to take his dog a walk
21187 hopefully i am on a run now but i was disappointed not to get more goals on saturday i had a couple of chances before i scored
21188 my hamstring was just a bit tight i dont know if it was after playing three games last week but i told the manager i didnt want to take any chances
21189 saturdays defeat was disappointing there were a lot of positives to take out of the game but the way we lost all the goals was poor
21190 we go into every game looking to win but montrose had a bad result on saturday and will be fired up so a hard game is ahead
21191 a lot of our athletes and one judge from oban were delayed because they had to be diverted so things ran a bit late but ive not heard any complaints so far about the day i was unfortunate but everything went well and everyone seemed happy
21192 there is a whole collection of these banners paid for by the league of the cross and embroidered by italian or german and austrian nuns some of them possibly finished by or added to or even repaired by the carmelites here in dumbarton
21193 these banners are magnificent pieces of work which have been embroidered using real gold thread and worked on pure silk velvet
21194 i have done what i could on some of the banners including the st patricks banner which was very well used but there are others which require the work of a conservationist that could be very expensive
21195 three of these banners were part of an exhibition of banners at the peoples palace in glasgow
21196 id seen an advert for the working programme but ignored it as i thought i was too old the i got a phone call from the bishop asking if id like to go i spoke to his son bazil who was organising it and i decided i would do it
21197 most of them are hiv aids orphans they are all attached to a family so youre not just helping the children youre supporting a whole family thats the first place we saw bicycle ambulances which are used to transport people to hospital otherwise theyd have to carry them
21198 especially as we didnt have things like sugar soap and scrubbing pads also the roof needed repaired and it hadnt been done before we started work which was bad planning
21199 on reflection i think it would be better to take money and spend it out there to benefit the local economy i took about 1000 pens with me for schoolchildren but i could easily have bought them in lilongwe they have just about everything there so we should be giving them the trade
21200 why should they have drugs we dont want because they are out of date why send machinery that we cannot get spare parts for its better to take the money and spend it there
21201 the contrasts in the country are striking there are some very affluent areas and you go from one extreme to the other

21206 i brought the plaque home to tullichewan recently to show my sister nieces and nephews and they are delighted
21207 this campaign has been designed to raise awareness of the effects volunteers and their work has within local communities the creative approach used targets people with the message that you dont have to possess a superpower to really make a difference and that everyone has the ability to help
21208 when you see the other models who volunteered to give their time i thought it was only right that i also put myself forward to glam it up a little
21209 it is great to see locations from this area represented among the most popular in scotland
21210 i am therefore delighted to announce that thanks to the generous support of bloomsbury scholastic and amazon and with the blessing of the wonderful people who own the other six original books the tales of beedle the bard will now be widely available to all harry potter fans
21211 the new edition will include the tales themselves translated from the original runes by hermione granger and with illustrations by me but also notes by professor albus dumbledore which appear by generous permission of the hogwarts headmasters archive

21224 1 an expression of approval commendation b worship 2 value merit b archaic one that is praised
21225 to commend the worth of or to express approval or admiration
21226 recent research indicates that some teacher attempts to create such environments by using praise may actually be counterproductive
21227 to foster self esteem autonomy self reliance achievement motivation for learning
21228 praise led recipients to have low expectations of success at difficult tasks which in turn decreased the persistence and performance intensity at the task
21229 certain kinds of praise may set up even the most capable students for failure because no student can always be
21230 1 to inspire with courage spirit or hope or to stimulate
21231 fosters autonomy 2 positive self esteem 3 a willingness to explore 4 acceptance of self and others

21333 is it consistent to profess our beliefs in church on sunday and then during the week to promote business practices or medical procedures contrary to those beliefs is it consistent for practicing catholics to ignore or exploit the poor and the marginalized to promote sexual behavior contrary to catholic moral teaching or to adopt positions that contradict the right to life of every human being from conception to natural death any tendency to treat religion as a private matter must be resisted only when their faith permeates every aspect of their lives do christians become truly open to the transforming power of the gospel

21399 the drc is one of the poorest places on the planet and that companies like danzer group are looking for ways to avoid paying taxes is simply outrageous
21400 the awful irony is that while the international community is pouring billions into the war torn drc to help it re build it stands by as companies like danzer continue to con the country out of substantial wealth through tax evasion capital flight and aggressive tax avoidance whats more these same countries are plundering the natural resources thus contributing to climate change and depriving local populations of sustainable means of future employment
21401 we are writing to express our concern that you have used much of your record profits in recent years to buy back your own stock to enrich the value of your share price rather than invest in oil exploration or production here in the u s or in the research and development of alternative energy sources that are demanded by u s consumers
21402 given todays strong market incentive for expanding exploration and production we can only believe that reinvesting your vast profits into the production of more oil and natural gas in the united states is a profitable strategy that will help our country increase its dependence on foreign oil
21403 this shows our claims on emissions are simply a big lie
21404 the government has known about this for a very long time but has just refused to face up to it
21405 there is no way the government can hope to achieve any of its emissions targets without cheating unless it changes its policies on encouraging flying and hoping to satisfy peoples insatiable demands for buying more and more stuff
21406 it cant be absolutely precise but it is a best estimate of where we are it is very much in line with other studies on the subject so we are fairly confident of it it is very interesting background information
21407 would not want to be held to an international target on it
21408 holding china and india responsible for emissions from manufactured goods they sell to us is going to prove very hard to negotiate
21409 it would be much easier to base any future deal on emissions at the point of consumption that feeds into the equity debate in which poor countries will be allowed to increase their co2
21410 its at the very least misleading for the uk government to claim reductions while we export our emissions this is a problem no government wants to face
21411 in emissions terms we are constantly battling against increases of wealth every year we dont even manage to improve our energy efficiency to keep up with wealth increases let alone to cut emissions
21412 theres a very fundamental problem here that no one really wants to talk about
21413 this puts many projects on hold just when we were building a wind manufacturing infrastructure in this country
21414 its deeply disappointing and hard to fathom that congress cant get this done especially when 90 percent of congress supports this
21415 but the dynamic is different this year because of the presidential election
21416 we dont want to get swallowed up in the issues between the two parties
21417 the combination of habitat destruction and climate change may be the nail in the coffin for the cactus ferruginous pygmy owl in the sonoran desert
21418 from the perspective of john q public whos wondering what can i do to reduce emissions saying certain activities count and others dont doesnt pass the laugh test
21419 and we need credibility with the public on this issue
21420 the environment kind of got more important as we went along
21421 its hard to be preachy when you eat a lot at subway and burgerville
21422 but i think its important to be aware of the consumer culture and not just go along with what its dictating i think oregon is really ripe for that
21423 the findings of this assessment suggest the need for immediate action to buttress efforts to protect health from current climate hazards
21424 this report makes it clear that if you have bad health outcomes now youre likely to be more impacted by extreme weather events than if youre at the top of the health ladder
21425 if there is somewhat of a doom context or feeling well thats because thats what it is
21426 its not because were making it up thats what it is we need to understand and deal with that reality
21427 they bring valuable railroad and management experience to the csx board and look forward to working constructively with their fellow directors for the benefit of all csx stakeholders
21428 its not a vote against andrew rice but it is an indication of a lack of depth of penetration in the democratic party base by his campaign
21429 but you put those counties together and it is a chunk of votes he rice is going to have to run better in those areas to be viable
21430 their elected leaders wrapped in slick tv ads and carefully scripted appearances
21431 we obviously look forward to the opportunity to debate sen rice as part of an overall effort to involve voters and explain to them the differences in the two candidates positions

21437 what were saying is exhaust other remedies mr president it is the economic life of americas families and to suggest that drilling offshore is going to make a difference to them paycheck to paycheck now is a frivolous contention

21439 dion launches new bold shaft whereby the liberals screw western canada no votes there and use the shaft plan to redistribute money to their friends all money raised from polluters bad polluters will fund the tax cuts for families companies and workers except for a few bucks that will be redirected to advertising companies in quebec very few also some consultants here and there
21440 this spoof on the ten percenter by lrb is disrespectful of dion and is juvenile the lit piece leak in its original design format and the forwarding of the derivative piece mocking dion are evidence that there are members of dions trusted staff that are undermining their leader at this critical time the derivative version of the liberal ten percenter is a bit disturbing as it is insulting to francophones as dions staffers mock his accent
21441 i was sitting at home doing nothing and all of a sudden a team wants me
21442 he gives manager cecil cooper one more weapon to call upon late in the game
21443 theyve lost a friend theyve lost a teammate theyve lost a brother and thats not easy
21444 i think for the most part they understand the direction were going in some probably even support the direction were going in but its tough
21445 you take a player who has performed the way jason bay has performed off the team and you bring in three young players while 1 2 3 4 5 years from now it should be self explanatory right now its a shock
21446 its tough for these guys and tough to adjust to
21447 we felt we had the right deal and moved on
21448 if thats the case ill look forward to that atmosphere
21449 im a player that loves to play the game it doesnt matter what uniform i put on i always go out there and play nine innings hard
21450 im a winner i come to win and ill always be like that
21451 in theory i think we upgraded offensively pudge is obviously still having a tremendous year one of the top catchers in the game today
21452 we signed molina obviously to be a backup catcher and hes one of the premier backups in the game today
21453 he stepped up and did a tremendous job here to hold the fort down while we were going through our stuff with jorgie
21454 there were things i was not comfortable with its a sellers market if you want to meet the sales price then obviously you can get a deal but i wasnt willing to do that
21455 im ready to rock n roll if we could match up with somebody we just couldnt match value for value in the marketplace

21461 there is a wave of people at the bar 4 people deep and also i cannot move
21462 thank you for having a good time at this party youre just awesome
21463 you can run up the side of that building there
21464 wow i thought you were toast when you went up against him
21465 this swarthy beast consumed the whole lower broadway strip another boring ass hotel i miss funland and all its classic wooden pinball machines
21466 his water is sure you shall see the king in his glory and your soul shall meditate on the fear of the lord
21467 mark how he has described at once both the water and the cross
21468 this means that every word which proceeds out of your mouth in faith and love shall tend to bring conversion and hope to many
21469 this means the vessel of his spirit which he shall glorify
21470 this means that we indeed descend into the water full of sins and defilement but come up bearing fruit in our heart having the fear of god and trust in jesus in our spirit
21471 this means whosoever he declares shall hear you speaking and believe shall live for ever

21474 way to exit the vehicle you panzies sic yesterday when someone opened up shop with a 12 guauge sic shotgun in the pennsylvania he got rushed by multiple people as he was still firing shots
21475 37 people didnt have anything to throw at him 37 people couldnt have over powered one guy with a knife
21476 isnt this the same mentality that allowed 2 or 3 idiots with box cutters to take out the twin towers
21477 they all watched and the bus driver had to ask a trucker to help him keep the guy in the bus
21478 no handguns allowed in canada we know but no woman had a purse to bonk him on the head
21479 no one bothered to throw a can of diet coke at the guys head who was on the bus the old ladies home and gardening society
21480 winnipeg is only a few miles from the u s border
21481 the idea was to get as close to the u s as he could if not get into the u s then engage in the attack in front of a busload of people this was another act of radical islamic terrorism on north american soil
21482 the prosecution is sending a warning that while some things might be tolerated in sports other actions wont be tolerated
21483 but the crown is saying this level of violence is considered reprehensible and prohibited on or off the ice and there are norms that shouldnt be surpassed
21484 im getting ready for next season and if i have to testify ill go testify
21485 this is one of the most unimaginable things to actually happen to a child
21486 this woman may have given birth to the little boy but she is no mother to have done things like this
21487 this child was brave enough to tell the truth and thankfully the jury believed that truth
21488 you knew didnt you there could be no pregnancy since you had a tubal ligation and a hysterectomy years before
21489 she has had a hard life but has a supporting family and can fulfill all the requirements of probation if you recommend it
21490 we can be here for hours and hours to talk about all the bad things she has done but if you recommend probation she can walk out of this courtroom and go down the elevator with you
21491 as a health care organization committed to the health and safety of our patients we have a responsibility to take a leadership role on this major health issue
21492 we have a further responsibility to treat the whole patient both mentally and physically allowing patients to use tobacco products while in our care defeats this purpose
21493 as a health care organization committed to the health and safety of our patients we have a responsibility to take a leadership role on this major health issue
21494 we have a further responsibility to treat the whole patient both mentally and physically allowing patients to use tobacco products while in our care defeats this purpose
21495 our decision to go tobacco free is not an attempt to force anyone to quit smoking
21496 rather the tobacco free initiative is a concrete way we can demonstrate our ongoing commitment to healthy living
21497 a group of his friends are planning to set up a hillsboro argus
21498 it was in excellent shape to be made in 1888
21499 congress should not adjourn until weve done something to bring down the high cost of gasoline
21500 i dont see how the leadership can adjourn when the folks back home are looking to us to help them with their gas prices and grocery prices they are struggling to meet their familys needs and congress should be helping them
21501 i am also an original cosponsor of the american energy act an all of the above energy strategy developed by members of the house republican conference
21502 republicans are asking for a simple up or down vote on this bill before congress adjourns
21503 none of these votes led to more domestic production but my legislation would take this decision out of the hands of congress and place it back where it belongs with the residents of the state of alaska
21504 this is much too long to leave americans hostage to the gas pumps
21505 exploting our suffering at the gas pump as an excuse to represent big oil
21506 every informed person knows there isnt enough oil in anwar to dramatically impact the price of gas
21507 the study also predicts a 2 to 6 percent decline in market share for all imported liquid petroleum products
21508 this means the price per barrel of oil would fall between only 41 cents and 1
21509 we re looking forward to returning to catalina not only because it s a great place to perform
21510 but because it also gives us a chance to hear an audience s reaction to many of the new works that will appear on our upcoming cd it s wonderful to have this opportunity to capture the excitement of a live performance and bring it back with us into the recording studio
21511 villegas and his band easily prove that they have the talent worthy of stardom
21512 we ve moved from a nuevo flamenco sound into the brown sound that had its roots in my old neighborhood of east la and was made popular by bands like war tierra and el chicano the best way to describe it is to say it s jazz mixed with rock and latin rhythms
21513 i love how we re appearing at a site that has welcomed team players throughout its history
21514 our trio is a team too the only difference is that we play instruments instead of a ball game however when we play all sides win players and the audience alike

21525 en concreto el defensor ha tenido un buen liderazgo al interior de la instituci n pero creo que le ha hecho falta presencia en los medios
21526 no es muy bueno cuando entr en vigencia de la ley de justicia y paz no se previ el volumen de las v ctimas y la respuesta estatal se qued corta
21527 el objetivo es lograr que las v ctimas sean sujetos de derechos nosotros dise amos junto con otras instituciones la ruta para que las v ctimas reciban la orientaci n necesaria para acceder a la justicia y la verdad tambi n les damos ayuda sicosocial

21531 la instituci n ha tenido un di logo abierto con las organizaciones y ha hecho una gesti n positiva con muchos esfuerzos saludamos lo que ha hecho pero esperamos que el pr ximo defensor pueda aumentar la capacidad de protecci n a la poblaci n en las zonas del conflicto
21532 estamos trabajando en la creaci n de una pol tica p blica para que desde el gobierno se reconozca que los desplazados son sujetos de derecho tambi n acompa amos a las comunidades desplazadas o en riesgo hay zonas receptoras en donde la nica presencia institucional la hacemos nosotros
21533 la garant a de la protecci n a los derechos de los desplazados es letra muerta por eso estamos ante un estado de cosas inconstitucional
21534 me resisto a creer en esa versi n porque de ser cierta significar a que a quien corresponde la guarda y promoci n de los derechos humanos ser a el resultado de un acuerdo pol tico y no de un compromiso tico y profesional
21535 liderar un proceso de selecci n en el que se escuchen las voces de la organizaciones de la sociedad civil que contribuyan a promover los derechos humanos y las facultades de derecho entre otras
21536 it is an honor and a thrill to be chosen to compete against bobby flay who is considered one of the worlds finest culinary talents
21537 i admire each of the iron chefs and im so proud to have shared their kitchen and brought my food up against the best of the best
21538 and i feel that i put my very best food forward i cant wait for viewers to watch the show and feel the excitement that i felt while competing
21539 in the discussions on human sexuality within the anglican communion and between it and the catholic church stand anthropological and biblical hermeneutical questions which need to be addressed
21540 priestly ordination in the catholic church from the beginning has always been reserved to men alone
21541 this tradition has also been faithfully maintained by the oriental churches
21542 i declare that the church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women and that this judgment is to be definitively held by all the churchs faithful
21543 lead to that unity in truth for which christ prayed
21544 a restoration of complete communion of faith and sacramental life

21547 with average performance great outdoor image quality plenty of user friendly exposure modes i feel the pentax optio m50 will make a great digicam for the average consumer especially if youre in the market for a pocketable model that wont put a huge dent in your pocketbook
21548 no other government state or federal comes close to matching victorias commitment to disclosing data about its spending on legal services
21549 helps the government focus on problem areas and gives the wider community a good idea of how it is spending millions of dollars in public money that cannot be said of any other state or territory government because of that nobody can blame voters in other states for suspecting the worst

21562 the difference between nato and the un is that nato is primarily a military organisation i can call in reserves when i need them that would be different with unifil for instance
21563 membership of pfp has upped our standards the pfp mechanism has been very successful in getting us to upskill and re equip and always to be remembered is that we cannot participate in any of those missions without the triple lock mechanism
21564 freedom is the glue of the worlds strongest alliances and it is also the solvent that has dissolved tyrannical rule
21565 the chinese government will continue its reform and opening up policy and support hp and other foreign companies to expand investment and cooperation in china
21566 shes eva really excited to have a place to party in vegas with all her friends
21567 we want to show that there is hope and life in cornhill
21568 they need to know someone cares and teach them to stay away from drugs
21569 weve been told that allocation has already been approved and wouldnt be touched
21570 that wasnt recently since the governors speech but thats what were going on
21571 no that money has been set aside for the school district and is there for them to use
21572 we will need to wait until we receive details of how the executives required cuts will be achieved
21573 at this time though we have no indication that excel funding will be changed
21574 weve already begun our project so we have the approval we need but now there is a glut of capital projects that need approval and the funnel through the state has gotten pretty narrow
21575 we will be sending in our paperwork and we also will be talking to state officials about allowing our emergency items to be done ahead of time
21576 the idea behind this is to help them communicate with their spouses
21577 when you get older it gets harder to hear and this helps them communicate
21578 the cumulative evidence indicates that on the day of the incident all areas of the beach were open and three lifeguards would have been required
21579 two lifeguards on duty were seated in lifeguard stations within the occupied areas while there were no persons in the wading area three lifeguards were required nonetheless
21580 as far as i know from the outcome of that hearing and the discussions at the end of last summer whatever we had to do we cooperated fully and very much in an expedient way
21581 two cars can just get by but come winter when a snow bank protrudes it could cause an accident
21582 the intent for that is to make for safe area for pedestrians crossing
21583 its really about pedestrians and restricted traffic to slow it down in an area where pedestrians might not be paying attention
21584 this is a perfect example of what happens when you work together
21585 obviously thats a case we would like to get more information on
21586 thats a case thats clearly on the top of the list
21587 i think in the end they are going to have to if they cut as deeply as they say they are going to
21588 the shell game of state cuts are that the county picks up part of the costs
21589 they reduce their costs by just shifting the burden over to us
21590 we are starting this process and the goal is certainly is not to create an added burden for counties or for taxpayers and during this process we will do everything to avoid that
21591 its wonderful that they are cognizant of the impact it would have on the local districts if they did make cuts
21592 i guess all you can do at this point is wait and see what happens
21593 then maybe there is a child who is not going to get the service they need unless there are local dollars are involved
21594 i will have to take them at face value for what they say
21595 but i would be somewhat skeptical that they can do that without some effect on the counties
21596 i expect that the cuts at the state level will cascade down through the system and affecting most of the direct services providers
21597 ultimately what that means is that we will have fewer resources available to work with children and families and fewer staff members to provide the services
21598 i dreamed you gone i tell you you do not look back
21599 you do not love me i cry a good good to see i want you to tears then wiped away tears as before and then tell me you do not go but i kubuchulai
21600 heck i cant blame him im not going to say that he cant
21601 ive always been one to follow my gut and follow my heart with decisions and when ive done that things have worked out pretty darn good for me
21602 my gut was telling me that this wasnt the right situation
21603 i still have a great passion for the game of football
21604 i still very much love it in my heart i still feel like i can compete at a pro bowl level but the situation is going to have to be right im not going to just play for any team or any situation
21605 ill be rooting for john as long as hes not in the afc west
21606 if he is ill be rooting for him as a person just not in the games we play
21607 but i understand how competitive he is and how much pride he has about what he does on the field
21608 john will go on and continue to have much success im sure if he wants to play he can still play at a high level
21609 john came up to me and said mike if the season started today where do you see me
21610 he came back to me and said im a guy thats really got to be involved
21611 i dont think ive ever been with more of a pro than a guy like john lynch
21612 hes the type of guy that you look at in the future and say could this guy be the president of the united states hes that type of guy i felt like i owed it to him to look at his options football retirement whatever he wants to do
21613 he didnt go to all those pro bowls just because they liked him
21614 hes a player and im sure he can fit in somewhere
21615 esto no es casualidad los dodgers se han involucrado internacionalmente en promover el b isbol durante m s de 50 a os el hecho de que el b isbol mundial venga al dodger stadium despu s de tantos a os era un asunto casi que natural

21619 eight pounds and five ounces doesnt sound necessarily big but it felt big

21630 ojo a todos los seguidores y aficionados del valencia y lo digo desde el coraz n porque est en juego nuestro club ya que al no disponer el gestor del capital necesario para hacer frente a su pagar est dispuesto a hipotecar todo nuestro patrimonio empezando por los jugadores m s importantes de nuestro hist rico club

21639 michael has not played a game for us yet this summer because he had a slight calf problem
21640 i will clear it up its not mumps he missed the england games earlier in the summer because of mumps but for us its been a slight calf
21641 hes back training and has passed injury but hes got to get match fit
21642 i speak to director of football nick hammond almost every day and really nothing is happening
21643 there could be certain players who are the target of premier league clubs so we could be exposed with less than a week to go before the season starts but im not anticipating any action
21644 i know the transfer window is open until the end of august but if business is going to be done after our season starts we wont have time to adjust
21645 borriello has a problem which will be resolved quickly so we will wait for him
21646 i have been following english football forever so to be here at last and to have a chance to play is just what i wanted
21647 i feel ready to do well for blackburn and i think i can be a success in the premier league
21648 i guess you could say im a skilful player whose strength is his technique
21649 he is quite an aggressive player he can use both feet has good pace and is getting better as far as his decision making
21650 he has played in midfield but i like him more as a central defender cum right or left fullback
21651 kenny works hard and they appreciate that and thats why he got a good reception when he went off everybody has an opinion but it booing doesnt have an effect on anybody
21652 there are quite a few teams we would like to avoid
21653 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
21654 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
21655 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington
21656 there is nothing more to this than the fact that he was describing that he was new to the political scene he was referring to the fact that he didnt come into the race with the history of others it is not about race

21666 what do you mean marriage troubles psht were fine see were fine
21667 all of a sudden we all heard this scream this bloodcurdling scream
21668 the attacker was standing up right over the top of the guy with a large hunting knife a survival rambo knife holding the guy and continually stabbing him in the chest area
21669 when we came back on the bus he was cutting the guys head off and pretty much gutting him up
21670 what do you mean marriage troubles psht were fine see were fine
21671 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
21672 for portal business the strong momentum we achieved in the second quarter was mainly a result of our distinct portal strength strong execution on our olympic strategy and the marketing campaigns across china for the second quarter all of these efforts resulted in the 64 year on year increase in average unique visitors to the sohu portal a good example is our unmatched success on the olympic torch relay project reporting in attracting both users and add timing dollars according to our research and independent research 62 2 of all internet users in china watched the olympic torch relay through sohu websites and 83 of all the internet users in chinas add that we will use sohu websites to obtain information on the olympic games which will be 29 more users than our closest competitors
21673 we also expanded the interactivity of the sohu matrix by providing users with alternative ways to access olympic information for example sohu bloggers can customize their blogs by adding their favorite sohu features such as news photos videos and so on making sohu blogs an all inclusive area where chinese sportsmen keep track of their favorite games teams and athletes in 2008 sohu blog has fully integrated with the largest online alumni club in china chinaren com and launched its space feature similar to the press feeds it allows bloggers to add tags and notes on friends and supports for rss reading
21674 in the second quarter of 2008 im excited about another quarter of record in advertising revenues it was mainly attributable to number one expansion of china internet market as mentioned by charles number two continued shifting of advertising budget from offline to online and number three sohus momentum in advertising spending as the beijing 2008 olympic games is brought near us the last but not the least for the increase in the overall effectiveness of the advertisers marketing campaigns on a silver platform due to extension of our unique research
21675 despite the earthquake in sizchuan province which prior to the earthquake had contributed to 3 of our online game revenue as well as a server shutdown during the three day national mourning period although tian long ba bu has entered its second year of commercial operations it continue to gain users and perform well in chinas online game market with revenue in mainland china growing to 43 3 million usd while representing a quarter to quarter increase of 13 this was made possible by periodical by new content release designated to cater to changing user preferences and attract new players for our games
21676 we are glad to see that peak concurrent users continue to increase during the quarter from 600 000 to 700 000 registered accounts grew by 21 quarter on quarter from 27 9 million to 33 8 million people after the three day national mourning period from may 19 to may 21 daily peak for current users bounced back to the level higher than for the pre mourning period and the daily spending increased when compared to the same day in the week before the mourning period we believe that this shows the stickiness of tian long ba bu
21677 further our early efforts to bring tian long ba bu overseas started to bear fruit in the second quarter our overseas gained license in revenue increased by 4 7 times from u s 400 000 to us 2 2 million now representing 5 of our total unearned game revenue to date we licensed tian long ba bu in taiwan hong kong and vietnam in april 2008 we commercially launched tian long ba bu in taiwan and hong kong and within three months tian long ba bu has became one of the most popular games in both regions we may on the opportunistic basis extract export tian long ba bu to other countries
21678 the strategy we use for q2 is really to grow the active paying accounts and trying to convert more of the non paying accounts into active accounts and on top of that we try to extend the life cycle of the games and trying not to grow output too much so in fact the launching of virtual items during q2 has been slowed down so that explains the decrease in the output i think thats a strategy that we adopt to extend the life cycle of the game
21679 so basically the correlation between the macroeconomic situation and the online spending is not a direct correlation i mean if the economy slows down it doesnt necessarily translate into a slowdown in the online spending because people maybe find the internet to be a more cost effective marketing tool or platform actually demonstrated in the recent real estate online advertising where you have actually more real estate developers find the internet a better tool to market
21680 sohus matrix is really providing the most of the people with most news information so it is a reasonable distribution of traffic but our goal is to really the most oftenly used activities like the blogs the communications the instant messaging the news retrieving everything we have the largest share and as for general activities the verticals can not compete with us because this need strong technology and the community and the overall platform effect and also our matrix has certain verticals like focus and 17173
21681 he must have stabbed him 50 times or 60 times
21682 while we were watching he calmly walked up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stared at us and dropped the head right in front of us

21745 dia mangku pastika juga seorang yang religius selama investigasi bom bali 2002 dia selalu menyempatkan diri ke pura untuk berdoa
21746 kita sangat dekat satu sama lain saya rasa australia perlu bali dan bali pun perlu australia
21747 kalau mangku pastika jadi gubernur di bali orang australia mungkin akan lebih tenang ke bali paling tidak mereka bisa merasakan bahwa mereka punya bapak di bali yang bisa mendengar dan diajak bicara jika ada masalah
21748 selama ini banyak keluhan wisatawan australia yang dikirim melalui surat ke gubernur bali seperti turis yang kena tipu saat menukar uang di money changer tempat penukaran uang liar alam bali yg kotor dan penuh sampah maupun oknum polisi yang menargetkan turis sasaran tilang di jalan
21749 turis yang punya keluhan pun pasti akan merasa berguna menulis kepada mangku pastika orang asing yang cinta bali yang memiliki gagasan positif untuk mengembangkan bali pasti merasa tidak sia sia menuangkan pikiran dan menyampaikan kepada mangku pastika
21750 kalau komunikasi baik banyak pekerjaan besar dan rumit bisa dikerjakan dengan baik sebagai daerah pariwisata bali perlu punya gubernur yang dipercaya oleh masyarakat dunia

21752 hanya saja kehebatan sosok mangku pastika ini justru dijadikan isu oleh lawan politiknya mereka bilang seharusnya mangku pastika tak usah menjadi gubernur kalau memang hebat mengapa tidak mengejar posisi kapolri
21753 bagi saya dan ini tak hanya untuk mangku pastika dan bali tapi bagi semua daerah di indonesia di era otonomi sudah saatnya daerah dipimpin oleh orang lokal yang memiliki kaliber nasional dan internasional

21816 a las cero horas el hermano capell n que representa la m xima autoridad espiritual de la comunidad templaria de la bail a jumillana papel interpretado por el poeta jumillano juan castellanos g mez lanza al espacio dos cohetes uno con los colores blanquiazules de la virgen y el otro un trueno de doble carga para avisar al diablo y al pueblo que el temple de jumilla por nuestra se ora entra en guardia
21817 en la que le piden a la virgen les de fuerzas para cumplir la guardia les proteja a ellos de todo mal al pueblo de jumilla y a las buenas gentes de todo el mundo
21818 a la una son recitados originales poemas a la virgen que obedecen a prestigiosas plumas locales y tambi n enviados desde diversos municipios espa oles donde se hace referencia a la guardia templaria jumillana
21819 la guardia de honor a nuestra se ora la forman las banderas de numerosos municipios de la regi n de murcia enviadas cada a o ex profeso por sus alcald as presidencias para la ocasi n y que son mencionadas en lectura p blica para conocimiento del vecindario nombres de las ciudades que tambi n se pueden encontrar impresas en un modesto programa de la guardia templaria que edita la asociaci n templaria a todo color
21820 de tres a cinco horas el temple de jumilla entra en silencio y meditaci n preparando el esp ritu para el rezo del rosario de la aurora que a las 05h 30 ante las mismas puertas de la ermita le dedican a la virgen como una despedida en comuni n con ella
21821 los templarios jumillanos decoran el per metro exterior de la ermita con escudos templarios que obedecen a las encomiendas m s importantes que tuvo la orden destacando algunas de las m s relevantes en la pen nsula ib rica donde no se les persigui ponferrada c ceres tambi n londres forman los escudos de aquellos castillos de la espa a templaria junto con cruces y apellidos ilustres jumillanos y a todo el que se acerca y le dedica unos cristianos instantes a la virgen patrona le obsequian con un vasito de exquisito vino dulce de los formidables vi edos jumillanos puesto a refrescar en campana de vidrio cubierta de hielo n ctar que acompa an con los ricos sequillos locales cuya elaboraci n se remonta a la jumilla rabe ya que jumilla fue una gran villa musulmana seg n los numerosos vestigios y recientes descubrimientos de tumbas que se suman a las ya conocidas en esta gran macabra de jumilla
21822 la asociaci n templarios de jumilla invocando y ampar ndose en el contenido nico en el mundo de las actas capitulares del concejo de la villa de jumilla fechados en 1614 1615 y 1616 se suman a los agasajos patronales organizando su guardia templaria a la virgen de la asunci n rememorando aquello que los caballeros templarios profesaron con total devoci n durante los casi doscientos a os de la existencia de la orden
21823 la guardia en s pretende ser una transmisi n del conocimiento de la liturgia m stica llena de simbolismo templario que adapta la asociaci n templarios de jumilla a su actuaci n no solamente en la mentada guardia si no en el programa de actividades culturales religiosas y festeras que a lo largo del a o desarrollan tanto en el municipio de jumilla como regi n aut noma de murcia y fuera de ella actividades enmarcadas en su genuina creaci n que titulan cruzada cultural de la bail a templaria de jumilla cuya divisa y voz de combate es por nuestra se ora
21824 los templarios jumillanos procuran cultivar el conocimiento de aquello que identific y distingui a la poderos sima orden del temple por ello extra do del museo del vestir de barcelona y diversa documentaci n hist rica visten h bitos capas con la cruz roja de las ocho beatitudes portan armamento escudos exhiben el gonfal n templario cota mallas y se hacen acompa ar por otro s mbolo templario una perrita guardiana que lleva el gran maestre el nico que est obligado a permanecer toda la noche de ronda y vela por sus hermanos de guardia
21825 esperemos que el viajero no se haga una idea desorbitada de esta reivindicaci n templaria jumillana cuya asociaci n es muy activa peque a y modesta pero llena de reivindicaci n del rico patrimonio hist rico y cultural que posee jumilla y en las guardias templarias jumillanas a nuestra se ora encontrar n todo lo aqu expuesto de forma sencilla y humilde pero hay que decir que solamente son dos caballeros templarios los que durante seis horas nocturnas velan a la virgen patrona el hermano capell n y el gran maestre de la orden del temple del bail o de jumilla

21960 barack obama has gone from being the presumptive nominee now hes becoming the presumptuous nominee
21961 he travelled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long column presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities his schedule for the day announced monday night would have made dick cheney envious 11 a m en route tba 12 05 p m en route tba 1 45 p m en route tba 2 55 p m en route tba 5 20 p m en route tba

21974 for some presidential candidate barack obama looks like the savior of american politics but a visit to a campaign speech provides a sobering wake up call the senator from illinois does not live up to the myth his campaigners are trying to create
21975 is surrounded by silence as he departs the applause doesnt even carry as far as backstage his shoes make a clicking sound on the wooden floor the crowd was not merciless in its reaction just honest the senator from illinois is recognizably not the product which he is being sold as at the beginning he was described as a rising african american star that was back when people were still being modest then the political marketing people reached up onto the top shelf and started referring to him as the new kennedy the new martin luther king jr the first black president

21995 hillary is a true roosevelt liberal she believes in markets provided they are properly regulated and are not distorted by speculation she thinks government has a role to play in building infrastructure and extending favorable credit terms to certain sectors she favors reindustrialization to restore balance to our economy tariffs to prevent dumping job growth she supports public service to restore a sense of citizenship and national purpose she believes that government has an obligation to provide education health care and safety nets she supports the nation state and the protection of national borders these are the solutions which appeal to the middle class in its struggle to survive and prosper as the forces of globalization intensify these views are anathema to the free market advocates who support obama those people trace their roots back to the house of morgan and the imperialistic doctrines of the british empire to them the world is not a collection of nation states each with its own unique identity history and destiny but a global marketplace where capital is fluid entrepreneurs are free to move production to the lowest cost venues and goods and services flow freely across national borders the eu and nafta are paradigmatic examples of this an economic system of this nature favors capital over labor low cost venues over high cost venues and thus works to the detriment of our middle class it subordinates national sovereignty to international bodies like wto and gatt it insulates globalists from the will of the people i have racked my brain to discover the reason why so much public hatred has been directed toward hillary clinton over the years but especially now in context of this election but i believe the overriding reason for this national pathology is the fact that hillary advocates an agenda based on the theories of roosevelt as opposed to milton friedman in that sense she presents a serious challenge to the globalists and their new world order

22067 were looking to understand the history of the ice trying to figure out if its ever melted see if its chemistry has changed getting back this analysis well hope to be able to answer questions like whether this is a habitable zone on mars
22068 we have lots more to explore within reach of the robotic arm
22069 weve gotten to the point where were pretty sure we found water and determined it was h20 one of the things with upcoming missions will be moving away from finding water to a search for life
22070 no matter how frustrated the players and coaches get it should never come to this
22071 you dont walk along the main street of hamilton and expect to get away with it
22072 as soon as i blew the final whistle one of the kio kio players came over to abuse me
22073 i tried to bypass him and he leg tripped me
22074 i looked around and i could see kio kio players and spectators coming towards me so i jumped up and started running towards the tunnel
22075 one of the spectators jumped in front of me and shoulder barged me i got up and ran as fast as i could away from the hostilities
22076 i will still referee but since this incident i have put a lot of thought into whether i want to continue
22077 but im determined and if i stop refereeing it will be on my own terms not on the terms of some idiots
22078 i have no problems refereeing in te kuiti i would not however put my hand up to ref kio kio
22079 we have already had a meeting and discussed the actions of those players involved we have also viewed footage of the brawl and have filed a report to the king country complaints review officer who then agrees or disagrees with our finding if he does agree then it will be sent to a judicial hearing
22080 i cant keep the premises open i cant take the risk imagine if someone contracted some sort of nasty bug
22081 at first i thought it was stormwater but then i saw bits of toilet paper
22082 you can stay on the gas and flip through the gears with no hesitation
22083 the shifting is mind blowing i mean you just touch the button and it shifts
22084 as i recall in 2004 we had a much larger battery that went dead on me several times during long rides
22085 it couldnt last more than three or four hours between charges and the battery pack and control system weighed nearly a pound
22086 it just jams the chain into the big ring no matter how much load is on it
22087 you dont lose any momentum and your legs never stall
22088 it shows theres a shortage of liquidity in the system
22089 what that tells you is that theres an increasing number of banks that the fed is classifying as unsound or inadequately capitalized
22090 happy warrior in the 2000 presidential campaign has turned sour in 2008 and the candor and straight talk that once made him such an attractive candidate are rapidly disappearing
22091 this is the first observation that really pins down that titan has a surface lake filled with liquid
22092 you get so used to driving sometimes you forget you are driving
22093 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
22094 i am yet to watch a single wwe show where punk is treated like a top guy
22095 raw was not just bad it was a i cant believe this made it on air type of bad
22096 todd grisham did fine as play by play and tazz seemed to enjoy working with him
22097 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
22098 i am yet to watch a single wwe show where punk is treated like a top guy
22099 raw was not just bad it was a i cant believe this made it on air type of bad
22100 todd grisham did fine as play by play and tazz seemed to enjoy working with him
22101 you need to get rid of that awful gordon brown
22102 where have you been you are the sort of person we need as prime minister
22103 i adore cars im a petrol head the only time i will give up driving my sports car is when i am too bloody old to get into it
22104 i drive to the station every day and i get the train to work
22105 my carbon footprint is not particularly good i need to plant a forest immediately
22106 the perceived cost of motoring has gone up so people are questioning how often they use their cars
22107 something is different people are using trains more because of motoring costs and other factors such as congestion maybe we have gone through that tipping point
22108 i can imagine that he would be a pretty exacting guy to work for
22109 thats probably still true i am more tolerant than i used to be there is a limit though when you rely on other people and you have to do your job through them
22110 its not until the trade unions punch you in the eyes and say no that you turn into an older and wiser manager those that never have to experience the word no are poorer for it
22111 it was a wholly political decision it was from no 10 and the department for transport was told to get on with it i am sticking my neck out but i dont really care
22112 i am not surprised inevitably on value for money you are always going to get poor results if that rate of fare increase continues it is going to feel more and more expensive particularly when people might be feeling the pinch
22113 im giving myself enough rope but i would like to retain this franchise if i can do that i feel it will be job done
22114 when i started my career people talked down buses i had a rather strange job to a lot of people
22115 there is a huge challenge in the bus industry to replace my generation that joined in the 1970s early in my career we managed decline as car ownership increased and the use of buses fell away now we are on the cusp of an opportunity to start building again and we need new young managers to help with the process
22116 hey look ive helpfully stuck a massive flag in your back saying look at me david cameron is vacuous look at me do you like it
22117 what the hell are you all staring at me for jesus havent you got anything better to do
22118 yesterdays announcements of further major hikes in heating bills will have confirmed the need for the employers to seriously address the shortcomings in their offer
22119 his weakness has created a have a go atmosphere for the unions
22120 both scotlands governments now need to tackle this strike and protect public services
22121 i am naturally saddened that our trade union colleagues are moving towards strike i believe that our current differences are best resolved through negotiation and we are available for constructive discussion that takes us towards a mutually agreed solution
22122 the scottish government has provided record funding for local government despite an extremely tight financial climate
22123 more prisons create more offenders and make communities less safe
22124 instead of planning to build three new titan jails to house an extra 10 000 prisoners by 2012 we should be planning on closing prisons
22125 to create a scandal over what happens in our jails
22126 in place of more than 100 years of single party domination in which the possibility of welsh popular sovereignty was extinguished we now have the emergence of a civic culture built round an inclusive national assembly with the potential for demanding sovereignty over at least the nations domestic affairs
22127 is associated with a shift from a culture of complaint to a more constructive agenda
22128 on friday staff in the maritime and coastguard agency will begin a 48 hour strike during the previous 24 hour strike the contingency cover that was put in place was barely adequate and it would not be sufficient to cover a 48 hour strike as a result lives will be put at risk will the prime minister intervene to solve this dispute will he pay our coastguards a decent wage or will he sit on his hands until lives are lost
22129 i will certainly look at the issue of contingency cover to see what is being provided in the event of this dispute i would even now call on the people who are engaged in planning the dispute to cease this action i think that it is very important that employers and employees get together to find a solution to these disputes i must tell the hon gentleman that 1 5 million workers in the public sector have already signed or are subject to three year pay agreements including nurses teachers and those who work in the department for work and pensions and in the inland revenue never before have we had three year agreements during difficult times such as these and i believe that there should be support for other groups of workers in the public sector signing up to long term pay agreements
22130 i cant quite understand why he is so focused on labour
22131 the legislation that has been passed particularly on moral issues around equality and gay adoption has been supported by many political parties so its not just an anti labour point
22132 thank all those who have prayed for me during this campaign
22133 the partys one sided approach to the human fertilisation and embryology bill
22134 when one considers the self inflicted injuries this labour government has visited upon itself one could be forgiven for thinking it had some kind of death wish
22135 i have always been a supporter of gordon browns leadership
22136 o alex tinha duas propostas irrecus veis uma do jap o e outra dos emirados rabes uma delas at era por um contrato de dois anos ele foi muito transparente comunicando o palmeiras e tivemos uma reuni o muito produtiva em que ele decidiu ficar
22137 conversamos bastante ele j jogou dois anos no jap o no kashima antlers e quis ficar por entender que o time pode ser campe o e n o vai se enfraquecer com a janela e ele pode ser o artilheiro do brasileiro algo que o palmeiras nunca teve
22138 o alex tinha totais condi es de exigir mas o palmeiras em momento foi solicitado a cobrir as propostas essa quest o de aumento n o partiu do alex partiu da pr pria dire o ap s ele decidir ficar a diretoria aumentou o sal rio
22139 apareceram propostas e v o aparecer outras para o alex mas para n o gerar uma instabilidade no grupo e por respeito aos companheiros achou melhor cumprir at para outros pensarem como ele
22140 na idade dele o alex assumiu at um risco ao ficar no brasil por mais seis meses e esperamos que a torcida reconhe a isso ele est muito feliz a torcida do palmeiras est come ando a gostar dele ele provou dentro de campo que um camisa 9 que todos querem
22141 you cant just quit i have you on the schedule
22142 the economy more generally is feeling the ongoing impacts of the reserve banks tightening of monetary policy as well as market based rate rises
22143 inventories were run down significantly suggesting continuing weaker demand and the potential for further falls in production
22144 manufacturers cited positive effects on activity from solid infrastructure and mining related demand
22145 the pressures flowing from slower market growth rising input costs and the ongoing strength in the australian dollar are a mix of both cyclical and long term factors affecting profit margins
22146 like all australian financial services companies our result for the 2008 financial year has been affected by external factors including the global credit crunch volatile equity markets and a succession of severe weather events
22147 while it likely the level of non performing loans will continue to increase in 2008 09 it is anticipated the impairment loss expense will remain within the historical range compared to the major bank peer group
22148 this is purely an accounting and timing issue which will reverse as the investments redeem or as credit spreads contract
22149 its going to mean anywhere between ten to twelve new jobs by the time the taxes are paid back its probably going to increase the tax base probably another 70 000 per year plus well also recoup hotel motel tax off of the rooms as well
22150 right now we have the worst of both worlds weak economic growth and strong inflation
22151 despite continued economic uncertainty at the macro level we believe spending on information infrastructure and virtual infrastructure technologies and solutions will continue to grow driven largely by the need to manage the ever expanding volume of information efficiently securely and cost effectively
22152 demand prospects next year look even better given the likelihood of timely settlements of record volume contracts with chinese customers and continued strong demand in other key importing countries
22153 the sharp drop in imports this year coupled with improving demand prospects is expected to deplete the chinese pipeline by year end as a result we project that china will report near record volumes next year
22154 x tells me youre having trouble with the department photocopier considering you can tex your own papers surely you can figure it out im confident x would be happy to give you a one time lesson
22155 he has a good point in general but not in this housing market
22156 got anything new for any of our users how about now now
22157 this is a government that has come to the end of its road
22158 it doesnt make any difference who heads kadima they are all part to a string of failures by this government
22159 the right thing to do when the prime minister goes is to let the people choose who will lead them and whoever is chosen he is the one who will need to put together a government
22160 but could you imagine if just a tenth of our student body 500 people were carrying weapons
22161 pressure is worse when other nicus are also full so that new patients are unable to be moved around we try to work co operatively but this is not always possible
22162 pressure is worse when nursing numbers and skill mix are down we are full at the moment
22163 while the current drop in the value of investments might have some impact on returns achieved for the year it will not be in the order of 2 million
22164 total loss from the fund for the year is 1 6 million
22165 if base capital reduces by this amount 70 million less 1 6 million the impact on investment would be a reduction of 112 000 income 7 per cent of 1 6 million
22166 water levels have reached walkways in some areas and subsequently large sections of walkways around the river will be closed
22167 the area is very dangerous as sections of the walkway have been washed away
22168 the walkway is closed and will remain closed after river levels subside for restoration
22169 it looks like there will mainly be showers through the day with some of them heavy this afternoon
22170 while the worst is over wed still want people to stay put if they dont have to go anywhere
22171 theres still a lot of damage around and the clean up could take some time
22172 we just need some time to recover even though it looks like we could get a bit more rain at the weekend this was a really bad pattern that hit us twice
22173 our biggest concern over the next couple of days is more slips along areas like the thames coast rd
22174 were just really encouraging people not to travel if they dont have to
22175 its been a doozy of a week but most people knew it was coming and stocked up on everything
22176 when i drove in yesterday in my 4wd the water was almost bonnet high
22177 theres no real devastation as such but theres lots and lots of water and flooding everywhere you look
22178 theres not much i can do about it apart from sit it out and wait for it to be fixed
22179 ive never seen so much water on the course but thankfully the damage isnt as bad as last year
22180 i also wanted to involve people to give them a chance to be part of it all
22181 so i thought why dont we give everyone the chance to be photographed this is our little attempt to immortalise the people of morrinsville
22182 one of the most exciting things so far is a photo provided by harry soanes menswear
22183 they gave us a photo from 1959 two of the people on staff then are still working in the shop
22184 this cost is due to a cctv camera being broken and several windows
22185 our windows are specially designed to not smash into pieces which would pose a threat to staff and prisoners
22186 the prisoners involved in these incidents have been charged under corrections internal charge procedures this has resulted in some prisoners being moved to higher security areas of the prison or transferred out of the prison entirely
22187 all the nice prisoners are going to spring hill and waikeria is being dumped with the rat bags waikeria turns into a really nasty place to work
22188 heck i cant blame him im not going to say that he cant
22189 ive always been one to follow my gut and follow my heart with decisions and when ive done that things have worked out pretty darn good for me
22190 my gut was telling me that this wasnt the right situation
22191 i still have a great passion for the game of football
22192 i still very much love it in my heart i still feel like i can compete at a pro bowl level but the situation is going to have to be right im not going to just play for any team or any situation
22193 ill be rooting for john as long as hes not in the afc west
22194 if he is ill be rooting for him as a person just not in the games we play
22195 but i understand how competitive he is and how much pride he has about what he does on the field
22196 john will go on and continue to have much success im sure if he wants to play he can still play at a high level
22197 john came up to me and said mike if the season started today where do you see me
22198 he came back to me and said im a guy thats really got to be involved i just dont like the role im in right now
22199 i dont think ive ever been with more of a pro than a guy like john lynch
22200 hes the type of guy that you look at in the future and say could this guy be the president of the united states hes that type of guy i felt like i owed it to him to look at his options football retirement whatever he wants to do
22201 he didnt go to all those pro bowls just because they liked him
22202 hes a player and im sure he can fit in somewhere
22203 we are happy to have the separation shown on the bill but the retailers are absolutely not keen at all
22204 they dont want it to happen and this only adds to the cloudiness of the electricity system
22205 he saw a flicker and then the roof significantly on fire and rushed back to the house
22206 when he woke me up there were bits of the roof already falling down
22207 what five famous people would you want listed in the contract that your significant other had to forgive you if you know you just happened to meet them and you just happened to hit it off and they just happened to express interest in some hot shallow monkey sex
22208 he was using the marshals service as a way to get girls
22209 you couldnt even question his stories because you could see emotion in his face as he told them
22210 now the reality is that conventional and strategic force modernization programs are strongly supported in the services and in the congress
22211 the principal challenge therefore is how to ensure that the capabilities gained and counterinsurgency lessons learned from iraq and afghanistan as well as the lessons we learned from other places where we have engaged in irregular warfare over the last two decades are institutionalized within the defense establishment
22212 looking to the future we need to find a long term place in the base budget for these lessons
22213 i firmly believe that in the years ahead our military is much more likely to engage in asymmetric conflict than conventional conflict against a rising state power
22214 we must be ready for both kinds of conflict and fund the capabilities to do both
22215 there is no doubt in my mind that the modernization programs will continue to have strong institutional and congressional support
22216 i just want to make sure that the capabilities we need for the conflicts were in and most likely to face in the foreseeable future also are sustained long term
22217 i personally believe that there is a real possibility of some additional drawdowns as we look forward
22218 some level of durability i think is one that fits
22219 but its still not irreversible we havent gotten to that point
22220 then we clearly are looking at afghanistan where results are mixed
22221 the challenges are certainly significant and wed like to get additional troops there as soon as we could
22222 im very comfortable that it gets us where we need to go from the military perspective for the requirements that we have
22223 its been spirited and i think a very healthy negotiation which in fact is still ongoing despite some reports that its imminent and i think we have to wait until those negotiations finish to really know obviously what the outcome is with respect to the details
22224 men so many men so few bullets and food naturally

22228 there is no reason why sharia principles or any other religious code should not be the basis for mediation or other forms of alternative dispute resolution
22229 it must be recognised however that any sanctions for a failure to comply with the agreed terms of mediation would be drawn from the laws of england and wales
22230 there can be no question of such courts sitting in this country or such sanctions being applied here

22232 aspects of marital law the regulation of financial transactions and authorised structures of mediation and conflict resolution
22233 it was not very radical to advocate embracing sharia law in the context of family disputes for example and our system already goes a long way towards accommodating the archbishops suggestion
22234 it is possible in this country for those who are entering into a contractual agreement to agree that the agreement shall be governed by a law other than english law
22235 we now face the ultimate test we have a decision to make because people dont vote for divided parties
22236 thaksin is not disheartened they respect the court ruling but it is not the end we will fight until the end
22237 there is no reason why sharia principles or any other religious code should not be the basis for mediation or other forms of alternative dispute resolution

22267 theres so much crap going on at a course from monday to wednesday im just not for it anymore
22268 i just arrive at the last minute play my practice round and get the tournament under way
22269 thats the only fairway i missed i tried to hit it to the fat side of the fairway and i came off it a little bit
22270 i pulled a muscle in my stomach and that takes a long time to heal i got that worked out and then i had a few issues with my shoulder but i think ive got it all cleared away
22271 i took a lot of time off and got my body a little more rested and played well today
22272 it was a very impressive quarter that blew away the street consensus
22273 despite a challenging economic environment and significant increases in commodity costs we are achieving our strategic objective of becoming a growing and profitable digital company
22274 the startup phase is behind us and we are now ready to put in place investments that will deliver higher volumes than previously planned in 2009
22275 while theyre growing in digital cameras and inkjet printers theyre not making any money in those new businesses
22276 thats the fundamental problem and it doesnt seem like theres much to change the profit outlook for the segment in the next six to 12 months
22277 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
22278 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
22279 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
22280 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic
22281 this particular incident as horrific as it is is obviously extremely rare

22284 the phone rang i came in and there was no id im like who is this i usually wouldnt even answer the phone i tried to play like i was asleep
22285 i still have to go out and work and do my job and compete and i will do that it just made my decision easier
22286 if you could have said to me six eight seven or five years ago that id be a patriot i would have said probably not
22287 but now that im here im excited about my opportunity and being in the locker room with guys like rodney tom and tedy and those guys im just looking forward to getting out on the field with them and seeing what we can do
22288 the most recent experience has been at detroit and seattle in mike martzs offense and then mike holmgrens offense in seattle the west coast offense
22289 i think as we all know hes a very experienced guy very good in the passing game and has done a lot of different things offensively in his career i dont think theres anything were doing he hasnt done before its just a question of adapting to the different terminology and nomenclature and a little bit of refinement here and there
22290 theres still a lot left in me theres still a lot of competitiveness when im done ill be done i still enjoy getting up in the morning and not being a couch potato
22291 if were interested in a player i usually talk to him

22294 in todays digital world photo educators are under increasing pressure from college administrators to give up darkrooms and darkroom development in order to save space and costs
22295 however analogue photography will always have its place and especially so in photo education arguably it remains the only way to teach students about the basics of photography such as the importance of aperture settings shutter speed and film speed considering this we are committed to helping the photo education sector in any way we can and this years back to school promotions are a part of this
22296 i didnt try anything to change my life other than dating different types of guys and conforming to their worlds i thought i had to be artsier more intellectual
22297 i have definitely experienced abuse in a way that i would tell people to take their heart and run

22301 the time leading up to the winter olympics is really an exciting time for an athlete because were training hard
22302 going 70 to 80 miles per hour on the track is an incredible feeling
22303 were running an event with the usa luge where were pushing people down the water slide weve got the timing system set up and were taking their times and were giving away fabulous prizes
22304 its just its kind of surreal its good to know theyre coming all the way here just to let us try this experience
22305 i think this is a great event to introduce people to the sport of luge were up from lake placid which is just an hour and a half away we have world championships there this winter its an opportunity for people to hear about luge here and maybe travel up to lake placid and see worlds this winter
22306 this is a little warmer so thats kind of nice the luge though is hard to beat its a fabulous experience
22307 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
22308 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills thats essentially the argument theyre making
22309 has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
22310 in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
22311 what were seeing out of the mccain campaign unfortunately the republican party some of their allies have been some very aggressive charges
22312 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
22313 im aiming to make it in august to celebrate my first successful channel swim exactly 40 years ago
22314 an opportunity to investigate our own collection and show why this was the art of choice for so long we wanted to tell the whole story

22316 we realised the addition is part of the paintings history but we couldnt fix it historically without aesthetic considerations too

22319 at that moment i felt the magic and i have felt it in c zannes work ever since
22320 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
22321 we hope to be able to answer the question of whether this was a habitable zone on mars it will be for future missions to find if anyone is home on this
22322 move from looking for water to seeing whether there were habitats for life
22323 we are moving towards understanding whether there were or could be places on mars that are habitable

22381 the biggest difference between dark knight and batman begins is batman was entirely shot without anamorphic lenses its all made in cinemascope the majority of dark knight was shot in cinemascope but a substantial proportion of it originated in imax format and we did all the post production in imax resolution a major r amp d effort
22382 there was an imax release of the film but this was achieved through the dmr up res process in which standard 35mm is expanded to fill the full width but not the full height of an imax screen the dark knight is the first major feature film to be shot using the native imax format 65mm 15 perf though its actually only parts of the film that were shot in this format five major sequences in all the rest of the film was shot in standard 35mm cinemascope the cinemascope sections of the film have been expanded with the dmr process to work in imax theatres
22383 that was all in house our tech team had a pretty long lead time in all of this so they started bringing in major infrastructure upgrades buying new servers optimizing the power flow through our machine rooms to be able to accommodate this vast amount of additional storage we had an extra bonus out of this we upgraded our render farm so it used less power so we could use the spare power to run the additional disks that we were putting into the building that was actually ultimately the final limiting factor how much electricity can you get into a facility it was quite an awesome exercise
22384 for me thats kind of unheard of i normally always expect to come in to look at overnight renders and see dropped frames and things like that but it never happened it was that slick it was very very cool
22385 the big deal was none of the sides were on the trump they hadnt added the glass at this point so all the internal stricture of the building was visible you could see right through it and all the cement mixers and spools of cable and girders and support jacks all visible inside it but we had to build it to work at extreme wide angle shots to extreme close ups
22386 we used our panoramic photographic process but also did a lot of digital architecture because there wasnt any one landscape we could use in chicago to actually place in these different views so there is an awful lot of green screen compositing and very careful keying that had to be done all at imax resolution
22387 wed done digital batmen digital stunt doubles for batman begins but never had to do anything seen this close up under this degree of scrutiny
22388 the guys really rose to the challenge the hand over between the practical and the digital batmobile is absolutely seamless the only thing people will perhaps find as a giveaway is how would you actually get all that to work but hopefully weve given it enough mechanical reality that it pulls all together
22389 this is a good example where chris would say we dont have anything here what are you going to do for me this usually happens when we have about four weeks before delivery so we are well into the post period the film has all been cut together then you are looking and see there is a big black hole there and chris says yes we need a shot of the batmobile doing this well what about a background plate oh there is no background plate you have to make the environment as well so we not only had to do the batmobile and batpod and batman but the entire environment that the batpod drives out into but because we spent all this time putting the pipeline to get the assets in place and fully documented all the locations and sets we could do this
22390 as ever chris wanted to do this practically if he could but obviously there are limits and though chicago was very happy to let us do all sorts of crazy things in the street they werent that keen on us crashing a helicopter into a building
22391 and i suppose for me to go back and talk about all of the changes that i have witnessed wed probably need a lot more than an hour
22392 thats what my father brought home so a lot of the values that you talk about as inculcating from our service really had their earliest roots in the love of our family and the love of this great nation
22393 so i would just like to throw that out there to everybody and let you know that we treat this like a profession this is our family business
22394 i dont think theres any degrading in the quality of soldiers that are coming today
22395 i think the ones that are coming today know what theyre up against they show their mettle in the fact that they commit during a time of war and knowing that there is a potential that they will have to deploy
22396 shes just happy to get into this business as well
22397 i completely believe that a game could come out and be more successful than wow im hoping that were working on it right now
22398 i think a lot of other companies have had great opportunities to do what wow has done usually for whatever reason they miss the mark
22399 i actually feel really bad a lot of times when new mmos come out and dont do really well because im not thinking of it from a business perspective i know what its like to be a developer on a team that you believe in on a game that you just love and for some reason you dont get enough time or someone makes a bad decision everybodys making a lot of small choices and when those go wrong your game ends up not successful
22400 not making choices based upon being different but making choices based upon whats good for your game
22401 if there was an mmo out there that had a tone different from wow but was executed as well i actually think there could be a huge audience for that when i get disappointed its because i dont see that level of execution
22402 the same challenge is on us are we going to make the right decisions i dont believe that just because we made wow were guaranteed on the next mmo that we make to have the same success
22403 i really believe youre only as good as your last game i really think you gave to prove it every time
22404 in a democratic society it is of great importance that the results of scientific research can be published
22405 transport for london remains confident in the security of the oyster card system

22415 im a huge fan of achievement systems in other games i love xboxs system and i also think steam did a really good job in introducing achievements we always talked about it for wow since players are always measuring themselves against other players
22416 with levels youre gaining tremendous character power skills abilities access to more items and areas with the achievement system we really wanted it to be a history of your accomplishments not gaining character power through it we wanted it to be a reflection of your characters power
22417 the greatest example is the xbox gamerscore which is for absolutely nothing
22418 i think by the time we ship well have close to 700 achievements we have 500 in the beta right now and that number grows by 10 to 20 a day at this point were really getting a lot of content in there kind of crossing all the different aspects of the game
22419 one thing thats bugged kaplan in general about achievements in the past is that theres no gauge of how far youre progressing toward the available unlockables
22420 ahh me laddies i be making love to everything i see just for achievements
22421 its been a big issue online but for the most part the response weve gotten has been very positive weve got petitions a few people on forums who are very loud but its really more of the squeaky wheel syndrome
22422 certainly internally theres no doubt i would tell people who dont like the art style that probably getting the art style was the hardest thing
22423 diablo is a game you play for hopefully hundreds of hours and one of the rewards is a variety of different looking environments
22424 people remember the act i dungeons but they kind of conveniently forget the green fields of act i and all of act ii and its palaces its bright deserts
22425 we had all kinds of problems with identification of units combat wasnt very good and the worlds got homogeneous very quickly as we played through it we didnt like it or think it was very much fun
22426 theres a philosophy that goes across all of our games and that philosophy stays true from game to game so it probably draws some comparisons
22427 one philosophy is that our artists feel like if theyre just using photorealism not creating a unique look for the game not stylizing so that its uniquely blizzard then theyre not doing their jobs
22428 if you do follow those rules theres going to be some similarities
22429 we dont say oh we dont want to do anything those games did its all blizzard were all a family wow pulled stuff from diablo ii if we think its a smart choice we try to pull stuff from them we dont really worry about whether its different what matters is does it make the gameplay better that always wins
22430 diablo can do a lot of things wow cant even do
22431 we cant do the level of violence that they can do in diablo iii we would lose our rating if we do the things that diablo iii does they have a much darker vibe
22432 if were actually making the game worse with no other reason than to be different from wow then its a bad choice we dont think when people play that theyll have any problem telling that its a different game
22433 we want to generate the feeling of everything getting worse its part of our narrative it makes the more gloomy part of the game a place where the stakes get higher
22434 everyone has a size 42 shoe and a cartoon look
22435 im just hoping that maybe they cared enough to at least acknowledge where our frustration is coming from instead of telling us to stfu
22436 the green fields of act i and all of act ii
22437 wow pulled stuff from diablo ii if we think its a smart choice we try to pull stuff from them
22438 we had all kinds of problems with identification of units combat wasnt very good and the worlds got homogeneous very quickly as we played through it we didnt like it or think it was very much fun
22439 the team takes care not to make the gravestones in wows pivotal cemeteries too gothic looking those tombstones belong in diablo

22443 taking one step back against arrogant powers will lead to sic them to take one step forward
22444 give us a call in two weeks time and say yes or no
22445 they know the iranian nation and are aware that they cannot talk to us with the language of force and threats they must give in to the will of the iranian nation
22446 our enemies used every opportunity to pressurize us in the political and nuclear fields and threatened us with the use of force
22447 arrogant powers have been threatening the iranians with economic sanctions over the past two years the capitalist powers resorted to their political and economic might to exert pressure on the iranian people and make them relinquish their rights
22448 at a time when gaza burns in fire and blood and at a time when the us presidents tour of the region has ended up in disaster any talks between regional states and the us and the usurper zionist regime will be futile
22449 iran must not allow the u s and others to undermine its relations and cooperation with other middle east countries the dominant countries in the region will have more freedom and more room to advance towards the future once americas exclusive hegemony collapses and it suffers a defeat
22450 when iranian divers courageously carve the iranian emblem on the sides of the american warships it is a message to the americans namely that we can just as easily bomb and destroy these warships p when iranian uavs hover for hours over the american aircraft carriers sending back images and footage with the americans trying to hit them but failing due to the compactness and maneuverability of the uavs this also sends a message to the americans namely that these uavs can be loaded with explosives and used to destroy the carriers
22451 if israel and the us fire a bullet or a missile at iran its forces will attack the heart of israel and 32 american bases in the region before the dust from such an attack has settled
22452 yes i must tell you that the time for americas death has come
22453 iran incentives include letter of assurance by us secretary of state uk official
22454 iran could have enough uranium for a bomb by years end
22455 no progress in iran talks so europe u s renew threats

22457 i just realized i could be a painter if i wanted to try
22458 when you walk out of the studio and you walk down the street thats where you find art or you find it at home right in front of you i paint about things that surround me things that i pick up and handle everyday thats what art is art is an epiphany in a coffee cup
22459 elizabeth murrays art reminds us of insists upon and celebrates the joys of living in the world the satisfaction of color and form of work and dreams the sheer pleasure a painter takes in playing with paint and yet it never lets us forget how easy it would be to shut our eyes for a heartbeat to drop our guard for an instant and go spinning into freefall off the edge of the planet

22472 we are down to our last y wing but the rest of our squad is doing decently well
22473 it would be nice if we could take care of these cruisers a lot quicker though
22474 i am calling on more reinforcements from the surrounding areas
22475 so far ive gotten three responses one of which is a group of six y wings to help take care of those cruisers
22476 the y wings wont be able to make it for quite a while but the other two will be in the area fairly soon just try and hold off until the y wings can help you out in taking down the big guns
22477 everyone we have reinforcements on the way jaina is calling in everyone from around the area to come help us in this fight
22478 just one problem the group of y wings that is inbound is going to be a while so we are going to have to hold tight until they can show
22479 we are still hanging there in one piece and we have full cargo load of bombs to send them a good peaceful hello
22480 good sounds like we need to escort you in for a closer look
22481 lets all move in for a bombing run on the nearest cruiser
22482 i hope satirez and paj know what they are doing
22483 tell me when there is a good time to pull back and engage him
22484 will do but he is trying to get in between us and erika
22485 well fine i think that might do even better then
22486 damn it he is too close to open fire on him now
22487 should i tell jake and erika and hightail it out of there
22488 i didnt i was expecting it to just bounce off its shields and push it out of the way so we could engage it
22489 you can stop randomly moving around now before i get sick
22490 i had to at least make it a little difficult for them
22491 but any way lets get back to what you were saying
22492 the part where you were going to tell him that he needs to not be so strict all the time just some of the time
22493 ill tell him but i cannot promise that he and i will get along great after that
22494 its not like he is used to the idea of not harassing me about life day in and day out
22495 i am almost certain that he will at least back down a bit
22496 he has been worried about you for a long while along with satirez and paj even i started to worry about you from all the talk between those three over you
22497 yeah you were missing for nearly three years and you helped save paj
22498 we just finished our bombing run on a sarakoth cruiser and all of a sudden in exploded gollda was caught within the burst
22499 no its not they need someone to help lead them through this battle
22500 good because i was thinking id have to turn my ship around to help you all out
22501 thank you for your concern jake but i am still in charge of my squad
22502 continue on to the next cruiser we still have plenty of time before reinforcements arrive
22503 jake we have a lot of movement heading our direction
22504 looks like our cover is blown we have a large group heading our way
22505 if you can distract them long enough we can easily get out of harms way and make it to yavin 2 safely without the need for an escort
22506 we noticed the small unit moving to you earlier thats the reason we shot three shots over your bow again did you not see them
22507 sorry we were preoccupied with golldas squadron they took out one of those cruisers
22508 this is not the time to celebrate we need to you get your butts in gear and get the hell out of here we will slow the incoming force and hopefully that should give you more than enough time to get to rekani
22509 now get going and take care of erika for paj
22510 you might want to buckle up we need to push this thing passed its high speed
22511 i will see you two after this is all over
22512 alright looks like we are going to have our hands full here
22513 we are extremely excited to be working with the u s postal service and the star wars commemorative stamps release
22514 we developed a branded broadcast room for the postal service it allows their communications team to service online and broadcast media 24 7 freeing up valuable time and resources plus journalists can go right to the source for video and information sourcing of video is especially important in todays newsrooms
22515 pathfire is essential to any plan to reach television producers and journalists with video usng on demand is the first to provide organizations the ability to reach these broadcasters right from their web site competitors in this field such as the newsmarket and medialink have no path to pathfire for online downloads and this severely weakens their ability to reach american broadcasters

22524 opinyon yan ng mga tao na kailangang pinapakinggan din idol is such a huge franchise a lot of expectations are going into it
22525 mayroon namang positive comments lately medyo gumaganda na ang mga nasasabi kaya ibig sabihin were taking the criticisms well were learning
22526 yung mga batikos kina jolina magdangal at wyngard tracy ang tingin ko kasi riyan walang maling comments
22527 habang naroroon kami sa gala iba yung tunog sa tv iba rin yung tapon may aspects na ganoon that we really have to consider all in all maganda ang resulta ng ratings namin kaya happy na rin kami roon
22528 wala naman sigurong bayarang nangyayari kasi malinaw naman yan na text votes ang pagbabasehan ng lahat nakakalimutan lang ng ibang contestants na hindi lang ito talent search you really have to campaign its part of the mechanics
22529 i was wondering if you girls could do a forum kind of a thing with a discussion question like views and preferences on makeup nail polish and such you could each give your thoughts on it and then open it up for girls to give theirs just an idea id really like to hear your views on makeup and such
22530 at first i wore it only on special occasions then to church every sunday and then i couldnt stand seeing myself without it on
22531 in times past women covered up there bodies and let their faces show nowadays women cover up their face and expose their bodies
22532 anyone then who knows the good he ought to do and doesnt do it sins
22533 simon son of john do you love me more than these
22534 lord you know everything you know that i love you
22535 love is the state where the happiness of another is essential to our own
22536 i never intimately knew you the oil it definitely speaks of a personal relationship with the lord since he stated that he did not know those who did not have it when he came
22537 in sikhism everyone is equal all people of different color religion caste creed race and sex are equal in the eyes of god no one is high or low all are children of god created by god and god loves them all sikhism supposedly also unlike islam teaches equality of all human beings including women sikh women can go to sikh temple gurdwara say their prayers and worship accordingly women can also take the role of a priest and any other role women can lead the congregation and are encouraged more to participate in congregations furthermore a man and woman can have only one partner at a time the only way for someone to remarry is if his her marriage partner has died or he she is divorced in sikhism the marriage ceremony is very simple and the same every time it does not matter whether it is ones first or fifth marriage but in islam it is not only different but very unfair to women a man can have up to four wives at the same time in sikhism divorce in marriage is done with the consent of both couples and it is very straight forward but in islam there are hard rules for women all a man has to say is talaak divorce three times and they are divorced if he wants to remarry her then his wife has to marry someone else and spend a night with her other husband then if her newly husband gives her divorce by saying the word divorce three times she can remarry her old husband now you can see what a woman has to go through in a marriage life such a ridiculous way of marriage in islam does not fit the modern way of life sikhism teaches that everyone should live a peaceful life and love each other as human beings sikhism teaches love humility equality humbleness and how to live a peaceful life
22538 supposedly on the other hand islam does not teach equality
22539 sikhism is an independent religion and it is not a sect of islam or hinduism
22540 knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of sleep for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light
22541 having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god
22542 let us therefore fear lest the promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it
22543 for he that is entered into his rest he also hath ceased from his own works as god did from his let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief
22544 but woe unto you that are rich for ye have received your consolation

22564 you are not to go to the left or to the right unless you hear a voice of the holy sprit saying this is the way walk there in
22565 one thing have i desired of the lord and that will i seek after
22566 as a hart panteth after the water brooks so panteth my soul after thee
22567 fear thou not for i am with thee be not dismayed for i am thy god i will strengthen thee yea i will help thee yea i will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness
22568 but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him
22569 but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord

22577 for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the saviour of the body
22578 we are encouraging people to see doctors after healings i believe in medicine
22579 it is the power of jesus we are powerless without the power of the holy ghost
22580 we want to give all we can leally to the media to give the glory to jesus
22581 this sickness will not end in death no it is for gods glory so that gods son may be glorified through it
22582 if you listen carefully to the voice of the lord your god and do what is right in his eyes if you pay attention to his commands and keep all his decrees i will not bring on you any of the diseases i brought on the egyptians for i am the lord who heals you
22583 thanks for the teaching it has meant a lot to me
22584 the walls between the countries with the most and those with the least cannot stand the walls between races and tribes natives and immigrants christians and muslims and jews cannot stand
22585 i have read in the last month every wordpress site and many others sites openly bashing abusing slandering the florida revival todd the latter day pentecostals and yet to date i personally have not read seen one valid criticism decent presentation at all
22586 evangelical fundamentalism too often also replaces the worship of god the holy spirit jesus christ with the sole worship of the bible bypassing the works of the holy spirit it seems though most fundamentalists will deny that
22587 they exchanged the truth of god for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the creator who is blessed forever
22588 who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life
22589 the spirit gives life the flesh counts for nothing the words i have spoken to you are spirit and they are life
22590 spurgeon was once asked when he would quit smoking cigars
22591 i never knew you is not a criticism by jesus that the healings miracles done by the person s were false
22592 you throw the term free will around as if it does not need to be defined
22593 and yet you clearly in desperation rebuttal quoted back a verse that has nothing to do with ones free will
22594 you have contradicted now three times the word of jesus
22595 spurgeon was once asked when he would quit smoking cigars
22596 they exchanged the truth of god for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the creator who is blessed forever
22597 yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and truth for they are the kind of worshipers the father seeks
22598 understand therefore that the lord thy god giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness for thou art a stiffnecked people
22599 and i will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all nations of the earth be blessed
22600 between the jew and the greek for the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him
22601 verily i say unto you inasmuch as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren the jewish people gentiles were never called his brethren ye have done it unto me
22602 shame on you john hagee for elevating jews over the gentiles by teaching that only the jews are jesus family mr hagee states above that
22603 thank god for the many saved arabs in the world and saved jews too
22604 pray for the peace of jerusalem they shall prosper that love thee
22605 for he loveth our nation and he hath built us a synagogue
22606 it was the mans faith that prompted the lord to heal the servant for without faith we cannot please god hebrews 11 6 hagee would actually lead us to believe that by contributing to a godless nation of rebellious jews that god is going to bless us you cannot show me that in the bible
22607 a devout man cornelius and one that feared god with all his house which gave much alms to the people and prayed to god always
22608 notice that hagee assumes that cornelius is giving alms to the jews but that is not what the bible says
22609 the jews had sinned and god was angry at them
22610 what better location could there be for an institution single mindedly dedicated to reaching and teaching jews their heritage
22611 so they can teach millions of jews why they shouldnt believe in jesus
22612 teaching jews their heritage dont you realize that their heritage is corrupted the heritage which
22613 salvation may be of the jews but 95 of jews today dont have it
22614 carefully notice that jesus spoke this to nicodemus a jew who was a religious leader over the jews every lost sinner must be born again if they want to go to heaven 2nd thessalonians 1 8 applies to everyone
22615 be it known unto you all and to all the people of israel that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom ye crucified whom god raised from the dead even by him doth this man stand here before you whole this is the stone which was set at nought of you builders which is become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved
22616 we are nearly on our side if we get out of this it will be a miracle i am so scared

22643 abortion is the greatest cause of death for women in paraguay
22644 abortion is prohibited by the law and was something achieved was maternal and infant health improved in the country did it reduce deaths those are the questions that i ask to those who work in favor of life and who criticize my selection
22645 abortion is the greatest cause of death for women in paraguay because abortion is penalized by the law by the christian churches in paraguay and around the world

22665 charlotte has been one of the real jewels of the us airways system
22666 you have more ability to cover the cost of fuel

22685 thats what my father brought home so a lot of the values that you talk about as inculcating from our service really had their earliest roots in the love of our family and the love of this great nation
22686 so i would just like to throw that out there to everybody and let you know that we treat this like a profession this is our family business
22687 the brunsons have passed on a tradition of service to this nation that it was all we were ever meant to do
22688 this is our calling from the folks we married to the things we do professionally this is it for us and so our treatment has always come from really looking at things through the filter of our own experiences in the army and its always been good
22689 i dont think theres any degrading in the quality of soldiers that are coming today
22690 i think the ones that are coming today know what theyre up against they show their mettle in the fact that they commit during a time of war and knowing that there is a potential that they will have to deploy

22760 the politics of fear it shows obama in muslim attire his wife toting an assault rifle a picture of osama bin laden on the wall and a flag burning in the fireplace all in the oval office
22761 just dont get it that their house organ magazine was actually satirizing hopeless red state drones for fearing obama no you cant draw pictures like that they say because people might get the wrong idea the wrong idea is never a problem when a cartoon involves republicans

22763 i know it was the new yorkers attempt at satire
22764 but you know what its a cartoon larry and thats why weve got the first amendment and i think the american people are probably spending a little more time worrying about whats happening with the banking system and the housing market and whats happening in iraq and afghanistan than a cartoon

22774 i dont understand why some people have to condemn students the as are obtained through their ability and hard work and should serve as the stepping stone for them to achieve their dreams theres a myth that students who are more active in the co curricular front possess more leadership qualities than the rest it is certainly not true as the posts they hold are mainly because they are popular the rat race to get the posts is almost like a popularity contest as it is mostly based on the number of votes they get from students the public universities selection of students should be based only on their examination results we do no want doctors who were active participants in co curricular activities yet have bs and cs on their examination slips true the workforce needs quality and well rounded graduates but i would like to re state that the number of posts a student holds do not determine their character as a whole if the government wants to nurture a well rounded workforce start by overhauling the education system and offer a holistic education it is not right for the students with more posts to have an advantage over the students with none please take their hard work into consideration lastly i would like to proudly proclaim that my younger sister scored 13as in her spm she didnt hold any posts in school but her peers continue to describe her being sociable outgoing and an intelligent person who should serve as a role model for all students yvonne kuala lumpur

22779 on the design specific aspects of the application who our vendor is can make a lot of difference as to what technology we use for the design
22780 so when we didnt have the final vendor we werent able to answer the questions to either ours or the nrcs level that we wanted to answer those questions so we asked them to hold up on the review of the design specific parts of the application
22781 they did about 30 000 man hours of due diligence with toshiba to determine their abilities and as they did this due diligence they determined that not only are they capable of building the units to the standards that we expect but they are exceptionally able to build them to the highest standards
22782 toshiba has been lead contractor on two of the units built in japan and subcontractor on a third one
22783 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
22784 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
22785 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
22786 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
22787 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
22788 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
22789 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
22790 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
22791 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
22792 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
22793 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
22794 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
22795 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
22796 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
22797 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
22798 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
22799 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
22800 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
22801 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
22802 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
22803 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa

22806 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
22807 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
22808 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
22809 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
22810 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
22811 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
22812 you have value on the ground more than you spent
22813 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
22814 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
22815 we invented for our selves other gods of various kinds
22816 into being out of non existence so were we now on the way to returning through corruption to non existence again
22817 this would be tantamount to his having made them for others and not for himself

22827 my father had a problem in his bones and it made me sad to see him in bed not able to walk but it transformed my personality
22828 i had a hernia and they operated on me but afterwards i went out to work again
22829 that was why i couldnt do physical education i was afraid
22830 it changed my life in a way that all manchester people remind me of it which is nice in 30 years time people will remember me as a united player that is not the worst thing you can be remembered for it could have been as the guy who missed that great chance in the final
22831 my relationship with the fans has been absolutely fantastic since the first game when i came on and no one knew who i was the affection cannot only be down to that one goal there has to be something else they liked about me
22832 i went to angola a few months ago and you could see clearly how much things were needed down there
22833 the aim through my testimonial is to try and build ten schools if i can generate more money through a scheme we have set up in norway maybe we can generate enough to build five more as a father i recognise how helpless these kids are if they were my children i would do absolutely anything for them so it is more important for me to be remembered for helping these people than anything i have done with football
22834 im not positive of the reasons behind this past years infestation but we have invaded their territory
22835 also the heat and very little rain have probably caused them to be more active in order to find food
22836 because of the supreme court decision there was no hope for this case
22837 blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted

22839 her hospital visit was precautionary she will be returning home shortly at present she is surrounded by family friends and fabulous jewels
22840 im a player that loves to play the game it doesnt matter what uniform i put on i always go out there and play nine innings hard
22841 im a winner i come to win and ill always be like that
22842 in theory i think we upgraded offensively pudge is obviously still having a tremendous year one of the top catchers in the game today
22843 we signed molina obviously to be a backup catcher and hes one of the premier backups in the game today
22844 he stepped up and did a tremendous job here to hold the fort down while we were going through our stuff with jorgie
22845 there were things i was not comfortable with its a sellers market if you want to meet the sales price then obviously you can get a deal but i wasnt willing to do that
22846 im ready to rock n roll if we could match up with somebody we just couldnt match value for value in the marketplace
22847 heck i cant blame him im not going to say that he cant
22848 ive always been one to follow my gut and follow my heart with decisions and when ive done that things have worked out pretty darn good for me
22849 my gut was telling me that this wasnt the right situation
22850 i still have a great passion for the game of football
22851 i still very much love it in my heart i still feel like i can compete at a pro bowl level but the situation is going to have to be right im not going to just play for any team or any situation
22852 ill be rooting for john as long as hes not in the afc west
22853 if he is ill be rooting for him as a person just not in the games we play
22854 but i understand how competitive he is and how much pride he has about what he does on the field
22855 john will go on and continue to have much success im sure if he wants to play he can still play at a high level
22856 john came up to me and said mike if the season started today where do you see me
22857 he came back to me and said im a guy thats really got to be involved
22858 i dont think ive ever been with more of a pro than a guy like john lynch
22859 hes the type of guy that you look at in the future and say could this guy be the president of the united states hes that type of guy i felt like i owed it to him to look at his options football retirement whatever he wants to do
22860 he didnt go to all those pro bowls just because they liked him
22861 hes a player and im sure he can fit in somewhere
22862 if you poll all the starting safeties in the nfl i guarantee theyre going to mention john lynch as one of the top five safeties of all time

22875 if i give them water now theyre not going to touch it
22876 his chickens and rabbits eat my vegetables and my flowers
22877 the fact that he was grandfathered doesnt mean he can have a catskill game farm

22902 we wanted to work through the day and leave for the airport and get on a flight later on that evening but not too late because we have four kids
22903 i was surprised the airline could do this after we paid
22904 carriers do adjust their schedules and they adjust them based upon operational needs as well as market conditions
22905 its really a jungle out there when it comes to knowing if your flight is actually going to go where you want it to go

22914 i think anytime you have animals as ecologically essential and as distantly related as bees and bats dying en masse it should send a canary in the coal mine signal
22915 bats are very good at living in high stress environments
22916 but theyve reached some kind of threshold where they cant adapt anymore
22917 they keep vast numbers of insects in check insects that cost farmers and foresters billions of dollars in losses every year
22918 it was very obvious to me that this was something new
22919 the animals that have been recovered have been devoid of fat reserves
22920 we havent known much about basic bat biology before this
22921 that is sciences little secret we really dont know a lot of what people think we know or what people think we should know
22922 the other alternative is that theyre coming in fat and happy but something is happening while theyre hibernating that causes them to burn up their fat reserves really quickly

22925 they think they live in a world that is run on grounds of morality and rationality

22940 the key mission for the united states looking forward is to maintain the cease fires and prevent people from going back to the warpath
22941 their purpose in iraq is increasingly changing from fighting a war to keeping a peace
22942 there is a reason to hope that its going to stay very low
22943 dealing with holdouts rather than trying to break the back of an ongoing insurgency
22944 we received far fewer bodies because of the improved security situation the current rate is close to any normal country
22945 i am optimistic that the worst has passed and we will not see many bodies in the city anymore the iraqi people are no longer interested in continuing the cycle of violence

22970 people have said to me from the day that i took this job they said look its the worst job in australia in politics
22971 but if i listened to commentators instead of doing what i think is right then id be losing objectivity
22972 i am absolutely determined with everything ive ever done in my life to see it through and i will lead us through to the next election
22973 we believe that when it comes to budget policy we have done the right thing it is the right course of action
22974 and as i said a 22 billion surplus is the best way you can position this economy going forward it gives you a buffer for the future
22975 the big challenge is as you know getting the balance right between not having an economy which is plagued by high levels of inflation forcing interest rates up over the long term while at the same time ensuring enough activity continues to be generated in the economy
22976 we have got our fiscal settings as right as we can but it is going to be tough tough in the sense of the impact on peoples family budgets
22977 look at the overall profitability levels of our banks they are huge therefore i believe they have got a responsibility to pass on
22978 we have had inflation running at 16 year highs as of when we came into office that then flows into interest rates and we have had 12 of those on the trot going up
22979 that then affects the level of activity in the economy and that in turn affects ultimately employment but when it comes to the statistics provided by the abs australian bureau of statistics it is not appropriate for politicians or prime ministers to speculate on future data
22980 the bottom line is we have an impact on the global economy flowing through to australia from the credit crisis coming out of the us sub prime
22981 we have had the further shock to the economy coming off the back of the global oil shock the biggest that weve seen since the 1970s
22982 the key challenge is that we have a course a pathway through this and thats got to be built on a strong approach to budget policy and a strong approach to long term economic reform so that we can come through this in better shape
22983 im rich in hope and peace and love ive got more than my share

22991 tomotherapy is extremely pleased to partner with lund university hospital this marks our entry into the swedish market with a prestigious institution that pioneered the use of many technological advances in scandinavia and europe we look forward to delivering the advanced hi art system to continue that tradition
22992 this was a great team effort working with the lund medical and physics experts to bring this advanced technology to our swedish patients tomotherapy was clearly the best choice from both a high technology and economic standpoint
22993 as a large center treating 2500 new patients yearly we are dependent on high up time and clinical reliability the established and clinically well implemented tomotherapy hi art was the only system that could meet the demands of our clinic
22994 we think tomotherapy is the most advanced image guided system for radiotherapy with an integrated functionality for imaging and localisation of the target volume it also produces the most advantageous dose distributions for imrt
22995 with the hi art system we see obvious clinical advantages for treating complex radiation target volumes multiple targets and targets requiring a high radiation dose with close proximity to healthy organs conventional 3d conformal radiation or imrt can treat some but not all of these case types if the cases can be attempted we believe the results would be less conformal less accurate and with much longer treatment times than with tomotherapy
22996 i didnt know for sure because i was at the end
22997 maybe it did hit the helmet but when you are not sure how can you ask the umpire if the sri lankans knew that it hit the helmet and still appealed then the spirit was not right

23000 it seems to be a year of firsts for me first major first world golf championships event
23001 i played great i struck the ball nicely after about the third hole on the golf course is there to be played a certain way and i just played it the way i could
23002 i could have holed a few more putts and had a couple less but at the end of the day two under is a good score
23003 i hit a few ordinary shots and wasted a couple of shots on the greens but one under is a start to build on
23004 i think this announcement today of a major new sponsor for australian rules football that hasnt been involved before really does show that we can put together a serious business case
23005 weve been given all these criteria from the afl that wed be expected to meet as i presume the other bids would be expected to meet and we are slowly ticking them all off
23006 we may be a small state population wise but we have a long proud history of australian football being played in tasmania we are passionate supporters of the game and increasingly were seeing that we can put together a sustainable business case
23007 were right back in it weve just got to go hard again in the morning
23008 i was just chuntering it was just an aimless rant i think i went in to see him afterwards and i apologised it was just emotion i went in and shook his hand and were friends again
23009 yorkers are probably a bit under used at times i tried to slip a few in and it seemed coming out of the committee room windows they struggled to see them
23010 i dont think the light was an issue it was the dark windows above the sightscreen it was really just the yorkers
23011 with the amount of movement there still is off the wicket it makes life tough for the batsmen i think there is going to movement throughout the game
23012 if we can get a hundred ahead hopefully our bowlers can get the ball in the right areas like fred flintoff did
23013 there are so many mixed feelings because last night they were almost positive there was something wrong with my nerve which could ultimately have been more serious

23016 it just seems that i cannot put 18 holes together

23018 the study demonstrates that our tight junction technology effectively delivers pyy into the body via nasal administration but that the peptide itself is not effective as a single agent for weight loss
23019 we are pleased that once again our delivery technology has effectively and safely delivered a large molecule via the intranasal route with good tolerability but disappointed that pyy did not show more promising therapeutic effect we believe our intranasal delivery technology continues to demonstrate value as a means of safely administering peptides and proteins and believe that pyy might still prove effective in combination with other weight loss drugs we would like to thank the investigators staff and patients who participated in the trial
23020 we are thrilled to launch our joint venture program with the acquisition of such an attractive group of properties these are class a stores in excellent markets and we look forward to bringing them into the uncle bobs r family

23027 we conducted an extensive review of our acorn division with the objective of analyzing its viability and future profitability with only 36 stores and an operating loss in fiscal 2008 of more than 4 million including store and corporate administrative expenses and a charge of more than 10 million for long lived asset and goodwill impairment our board and senior management concluded that further investment would not be in the best interests of the company and its shareholders
23028 store locations brand identity store economics and the current retail and economic environment were factors that contributed to the less than satisfactory performance of the division exiting this concept now allows us to focus our efforts on our two core brands and other strategic initiatives we made what is a difficult but nonetheless what we believe to be the right decision however i want to thank the talented acorn division team for their hard work and efforts over the past several years
23029 i am extremely pleased to have maria joining the wet seal team maria brings a tremendous wealth of merchandising and organizational leadership skills to our company her passion for and experience in young womens apparel and accessories make maria the ideal leader to build upon the wet seal divisions recent success
23030 virtual worlds have witnessed considerable growth among consumers but companies have lacked the economic justification metrics and process to guide investments
23031 companies will require more specific measurement tools in order to continue their investments in virtual worlds
23032 virtual worlds can serve as a strategic catalyst for penetrating youthful markets as well as a checkpoint for demonstrating a companys focus on innovation
23033 multi billion dollar global brand companies looking to target the global youth market should be investing a minimum of one percent of their advertising and promotional budget in virtual worlds
23034 our research shows that not only is simulation one of the top strategies for engineering executives but that enabling multiphysics analyses is a fundamental key to success
23035 by adding the world class simulation technology of ansoft targeted at the electronics industries ansys is poised to address the continuing convergence of the mechanical and electrical worlds across a whole range of industry sectors the collective depth and breadth in simulation technology that ansys now possesses will enable them to provide very comprehensive multiphysics solutions by tightly integrating these critical simulation domains previously assessed separately
23036 finalizing the acquisition of ansoft is great news for us our customers and our partners we are very excited to be able to move forward today as a unified company and begin executing our strategy for the future
23037 with the operations and technology synergies that ansoft and ansys share we are confident that we can meet the needs of the cae community for simulation software and services in a highly effective manner
23038 he has clearly done a terrific job of building ansoft as a world class developer of electronic design automation software and we look forward to his contributions as a director of ansys like ansys ansoft is very focused on technology leadership and innovation and zols experience and insight will be most helpful to us

23047 im going to sue you im going to take all your names
23048 ya estamos preparados vamos a trabajar el partido de acuerdo a como lo planeamos toda la semana necesitamos jugar muy inteligentemente y con los dientes apretados como lo hicimos la semana pasada en ciudad ju rez todos estamos mentalizados en eso
23049 creo que sus dos delanteros son muy r pidos eso hace que marque una diferencia con el resto de los equipos porque generalmente los equipos tienen delanteros altos y fuertes en chivas se juega mucho por abajo con mucha velocidad entonces hay que tener cuidado con ellos adem s de que cerraremos los espacios para no dar pie al contragolpe porque ellos lo aprovechan muy bien
23050 es un portero con personalidad afront muy bien la responsabilidad habr que seguir poni ndolo a prueba para ver si est en su d a esperemos que no est en su d a para que nosotros podamos conseguir goles y lograr la victoria
23051 estoy sorprendido y contento sorprendido por el hecho que hemos jugado poco y a lo mejor el entrenador nos ha visto muy bien las oportunidades as son y hay que tratar de aprovecharlas cuando vengan
23052 significa mucho pues hace como cinco a os que estuve en la selecci n y en ese per odo estuve trabajando duro para volver a tener esa oportunidad ahora tratar de aprovecharla y la verdad estoy muy contento
23053 ya son cinco o seis a os de trabajo del osasuna a ahora me siento con mucha m s experiencia siento que puedo ir m s preparado con la confianza de que se debe pelear un puesto
23054 hay jugadores muy importantes en donde todos vamos a querer jugar y nada va a ser f cil ahora nos toc el llamado con muchas ilusiones con entrenador nuevo y esperamos hacer bien las cosas
23055 me avis lalo everardo valdez responsable de prensa de rayados y pens que estaba jugando la verdad la primera vez que me dijo pens que estaba jugando
23056 la cr tica siempre la va a haber y la respuesta se da dentro de la cancha as sean positivas o negativas pero a final de cuentas qui nes toman las decisiones son los entrenadores
23057 muy contento siempre el poder estar en la selecci n es un motivo de mucha alegr a y tambi n de mucho compromiso me parece que uno se pone muy contento por estar haciendo las cosas bien
23058 es muy importante pero tambi n es esa responsabilidad de saber que hay que seguir trabajando mejorar crecer e ir aprendiendo para estar al servicio de la selecci n
23059 primero debemos de demostrar que queremos ir al mundial y la principal idea es pasar la eliminatoria eso lo debemos tener en mente y aportarle algo a la selecci n y en consecuencia m xico debe hacerse notar en esta rea
23060 tambi n sorprende lo de leandro augusto a m me halaga porque sigo creyendo en algo de que dije y creo de que va confirmando lo que uno habl se van confirmando las cosas
23061 yo digo que el tiempo pone a cada quien en su lugar por algo estar llamando a ese jugador
23062 nadie puede hablar porque no sabemos qu va a trabajar o qu sistema va a utilizar porque l sven goran eriksson reci n va a empezar a trabajar a mostrar las inquietudes que tenga
23063 los que hemos estado en la selecci n hemos tenido que batallar con los volantes ofensivos y con los nueves a m no me llama la atenci n la convocatoria de carlos ochoa cada t cnico quiere ver las caracter sticas de un nueve que puedan ser diferentes a la de los dem s
23064 qu bueno por carlos ochoa y qu bueno esto demuestra que en el futbol las sorpresas siempre existen
23065 yo no tengo nada que ver en los convocados de rayados la experiencia de l sven goran eriksson no est en duda para nada l va a hacer y a determinar lo que l quiere
23066 aclaro una cosa es monterrey estoy en monterrey si quieren saber algo del monterrey de la selecci n nacional yo no hablo no hablo de la selecci n
23067 obligados a ganar son tres puntos en nuestra cancha important simos son de los puntos que no se deben de perder estamos trabajando con la seriedad debida con un respeto hacia todos los equipos
23068 estos tres puntos son importantes como los de la fecha diecis is y diecisiete cuando termina un campeonato en ese sentido ganar
23069 son muy respetables los comentarios de germ n y m s que molestarme para m es un indicativo que va a pelear por su puesto y eso me da gusto porque de alguna manera eso genera que haya una gran competencia en el interior de este grupo y nos va a venir bastante bien en todos los mbitos y en cada una de las posiciones
23070 espero y me gustar a que as como l fue el primero en manifestar su inconformidad por no jugar los dem s jugadores que est n en la banca muestren su mismo mpetu de luchar por un lugar
23071 sin duda villa es uno de los conos del club y que f sicamente est muy bien en estos momentos sin embargo lo m s importante que debe hacer durante estos seis meses es adaptarse a este sistema de juego por que aunque muchos de los jugadores tienen su lugar dentro de la cancha se lo tienen que ganar como el primer d a en que llegaron
23072 durante estos d as hemos platicado muy seguido con l para reiterarle que sta es su casa y que estamos muy contentos con su trabajo esto con la intensi n de que se quede por muchos a os m s y esperar a ver c mo se desarrolla durante este torneo
23073 richard fue negociado en el draft y el nico conocimento que tenemos sobre l es que no se present con el club puebla el se or est totalmente fuera y sin alguna relaci n laboral con el equipo am rica
23074 no tanto porque sea chivas sino porque es el rival de grupo significar an cuatro puntos arriba de ellos y despu s con dos salidas muy dif ciles as que nos dejar a bien parados y trabajando con m s tranquilidad con mejor confianza pero sabemos que no va a ser nada f cil creemos tener las armas suficientes para hacerles da o y para poderlos contener y eso trataremos de hacer
23075 estamos ansiosos de que llegue el momento de enfrentarnos a chivas de que podamos salir avantes con un buen futbol con mucha dedicaci n y sobre todo d ndole una alegr a a la afici n
23076 son variantes del sistema completamente pero vamos de entrada como hemos jugado eso ser en caso de que no nos podamos acomodar ojal que s nos acomodemos esto para estar tranquilos y darle adelante
23077 estoy contento siempre es motivante porque empieza una nueva era y es bueno seguir contemplado igualmente a mi edad y con una convocatoria m s me voy contento a mat as tarde o temprano va a estar en la selecci n porque re ne todos los lineamientos para serlo y pronto deber estar no tengo ninguna duda de eso
23078 se especulaba mucho se sent a que vuoso pod a llegar y creo que con tiempo le llegar porque tiene el derecho de estar y tendr que seguir haciendo las cosas bien con su equipo para poder estar ah
23079 a m me llega bien en el inicio de torneo y despu s de haber estado en los ltimos partidos con la selecci n en que las cosas se hicieron bien y en esta ocasi n el t cnico se decidi porque a mi me ayudo para estar en ritmo y ser convocado
23080 si se me dan la oportunidad contra necaxa tratar de hacer un buen partido
23081 yo que t mejor pienso en lo peor as le hago yo si despu s te dicen que no te rompiste que s lo te explotaron adherencias pues ya vas de gane
23082 ese d a tuve mala suerte pero tambi n responsabilidad porque me apresur en la rehabilitaci n y desgraciadamente me volv a tronar
23083 yo llegu a puebla en 2006 a probarme con el equipo de primera a despu s de jugar en playa del carmen de segunda divisi n y gracias a dios me qued en tigres me compraron hace cinco a os y todav a tengo contrato con ellos pero ya en mayo se acaba y la verdad estoy contento ac en puebla
23084 a m me gusta entrenar fuerte y hacerlo de la mejor manera soy muy luch n voy por todas las pelotas y si se me dan la oportunidad contra necaxa tratar de hacer un buen partido
23085 estoy tranquilo pensando en atlas en que se viene un partido importante el s bado y que merece la mayor concentraci n por parte m a sin distraerme de otras cosas que podr an ser pero son supuestos o cosas parecidas pero el grupo merece que estemos todos concentrados para el s bado
23086 para m es importante y no voy a esconder que me gustar a jugar en europa es un sue o que tengo y ojal alg n d a lo vaya a cumplir pero como te digo parece m s responsable de mi parte estar pensando en el pr ximo partido y trabajar para conseguir esos tres puntos que son importantes en este inicio de torneo
23087 para m es un orgullo estar en una lista o ser pretendido por alguien pero estando tan cerca de un partido ahora pienso en cruz azul y ma ana quedamos concentrados y despu s llegado el momento si hay algo se hablar
23088 the key mission for the united states looking forward is to maintain the cease fires and prevent people from going back to the warpath
23089 their purpose in iraq is increasingly changing from fighting a war to keeping a peace
23090 there is a reason to hope that its going to stay very low
23091 dealing with holdouts rather than trying to break the back of an ongoing insurgency
23092 we received far fewer bodies because of the improved security situation the current rate is close to any normal country
23093 i am optimistic that the worst has passed and we will not see many bodies in the city anymore the iraqi people are no longer interested in continuing the cycle of violence
23094 the number of bodies has declined but i think this is a temporary calm because there are sleeper cells ready to resume their killings anytime
23095 also there are militiamen who have fled the country and might return as soon as possible
23096 christian will examine these practices their effects and provide examples where such a grass roots approach helped convince management to support or pilot fully agile approaches
23097 agile practices emerge in a collaborative environment as the leader on several projects i saw the emergence of iterative development test first evolving functional specs pair programming minimal documentation and customer involvement at every step of the way successful tools to create this environment cover creating an open environment bringing the right experience skills and thinkers together how to stimulate and foster the free flow of ideas and letting people to decide what they want to do and by when self accountability tools to lead collaboration will also be introduced
23098 the participants become familiar with patterns of cultural smells and appropriate refactoring activities and are guided to check their fitness for their organizations as well as to develop new ones
23099 we believe that if teams dont stay in the moment look below the surface at the here and now and maintain openness and wonderment they will ultimately adopt a fake agile and fail in their adoption they will kill the whole intent of agile for software teams that is they will miss the maturation and growth born of team and self inspection and adaption without judgment and without adherence to pre conceived notions of some gross level agile practices
23100 research shows culture is the single most important factor in organizational success
23101 we will reveal and discuss the essential mindset shifts a project manager must undertake to become an effective agile coach we will talk about how that leads to changes in actions and changes in conversations and decision making both within your team and with the external world we will look at the latest thinking on highly collaborative and high performing teams and consider our own actions relative to fostering such teams
23102 there are two fundamental problems with the current state of agile adoption 1 companies suck less than we did before and that is acceptable 2 most companies are blind to the game changing benefits of pursuing excellence in agile organization
23103 which is all very well but how can we get around the brittleness that has plagued automated ui tests in the past a key is to address the form in which the tests are recorded how they identify what is being done with the gui once upon a time this was the screen mechanics click on pixel 124 21 and the tests broke as soon as you ran with different monitor settings now its usually the gui toolkit mechanics find this jtable and click in the third cell of the second row but what if we ended up recording intent instead of mechanics in a domain language
23104 we all know folks who seem to be naturally creative outrageously productive somehow able to do things we cant do
23105 this session is for any agile coach or leader who is facing challenges and looking for creative ways for facing them in this practical session we hope to do two things first mine some of the hardest real world problems that attending scrum masters and other agile leaders have faced within their teams

23107 we worried about how to put together good copy for the korean version we wanted to go with the trend towards using idioms that would involve the heros name in this case po
23108 behind her s line is the secret of how she lost weight
23109 basically we look at the high concept outline and make copy from that we read the script and come up with different lines and then the posters are made and we revise that copy in addition to coming up with new lines
23110 actually if the outline is clear then the copy just jumps right out for 200 pound beauty the scenario left a clear impression while reading it all kinds of ideas came and when the poster was revealed the secret of lost weight line just wrote itself
23111 it reflects the inner and outer sides of the film right now chungmuro is facing a worse domestic and foreign currency situation than ever before so these days people want to see movies with lighthearted stories
23112 we didnt want to use the global copy pandamonium we wanted something that would have just four syllables and the impactful lines and were born
23113 with the teaser copy we wanted something that would express the king fu skills of the main character po in a kung fu pose for the main copy its an expression that implies the dramatic course of the film where a would be noodle shop owner achieves his dreams
23114 copy written even when the movie is about to debut is successful if the movie is and if you work hard for five months on it but the movie fails nobody pays attention to it
23115 i got a phone call from my old college classmare jo seong woo telling me they had only five million won and what could they do with that we looked at it together agreed it was very little money and wondered if we should just give up but we didnt in one scene we included the film the music the love all of it

23149 for too many years libya has refused to accept responsibility for its horrific acts of terrorism against american victims but after the pressure we applied libya can finally be held accountable for these devastating events
23150 now these victims and their families can get the long overdue justice they deserve
23151 it will allow them the fair and just compensation that theyve been seeking in an expeditious manner
23152 allow the united states and libya to finally close the book on a contentious period in our relationship and to look to the future

23159 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times

23161 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
23162 was cutting his head off and pretty much gutting him
23163 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
23164 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic

23233 on the one hand alzheimers disease is a complex pathologic process and that is daunting
23234 but now we are beginning to segregate out different therapeutic targets and develop drugs that have an impact on each target so in combination they may handle the disease better than any single approach
23235 we established the association but when it comes to explaining it we can only speculate at this state
23236 if you are looking for interventions to prevent alzheimers one way may be to identify people who have been divorced or widowed and who havent adapted or gotten back into the social circle and give them support with the aim of giving them new structure and social networks in their lives
23237 they want to endanger the internal stability in more than one country and region
23238 it requires condemnation and serious action by the lebanese authorities and the united nations

23273 christian will examine these practices their effects and provide examples where such a grass roots approach helped convince management to support or pilot fully agile approaches
23274 agile practices emerge in a collaborative environment as the leader on several projects i saw the emergence of iterative development test first evolving functional specs pair programming minimal documentation and customer involvement at every step of the way successful tools to create this environment cover creating an open environment bringing the right experience skills and thinkers together how to stimulate and foster the free flow of ideas and letting people to decide what they want to do and by when self accountability tools to lead collaboration will also be introduced
23275 the participants become familiar with patterns of cultural smells and appropriate refactoring activities and are guided to check their fitness for their organizations as well as to develop new ones
23276 we believe that if teams dont stay in the moment look below the surface at the here and now and maintain openness and wonderment they will ultimately adopt a fake agile and fail in their adoption they will kill the whole intent of agile for software teams that is they will miss the maturation and growth born of team and self inspection and adaption without judgment and without adherence to pre conceived notions of some gross level agile practices
23277 research shows culture is the single most important factor in organizational success
23278 we will reveal and discuss the essential mindset shifts a project manager must undertake to become an effective agile coach we will talk about how that leads to changes in actions and changes in conversations and decision making both within your team and with the external world we will look at the latest thinking on highly collaborative and high performing teams and consider our own actions relative to fostering such teams
23279 there are two fundamental problems with the current state of agile adoption 1 companies suck less than we did before and that is acceptable 2 most companies are blind to the game changing benefits of pursuing excellence in agile organization
23280 which is all very well but how can we get around the brittleness that has plagued automated ui tests in the past a key is to address the form in which the tests are recorded how they identify what is being done with the gui once upon a time this was the screen mechanics click on pixel 124 21 and the tests broke as soon as you ran with different monitor settings now its usually the gui toolkit mechanics find this jtable and click in the third cell of the second row but what if we ended up recording intent instead of mechanics in a domain language

23333 harriet miers is not immune from compelled congressional process she is legally required to testify pursuant to a duly issued congressional subpoena
23334 very good news for anyone who believes in the constitution of the united states and the separation of powers and checks and balances
23335 this decision should send a clear signal to the bush administration that it must cooperate fully with congress and that former administration officials harriet miers and karl rove must testify before congress
23336 if the administration appeals the ruling our congressional prerogatives will once again be put at risk
23337 we look forward to the white house complying with this ruling and to scheduling future hearings with ms miers and other witnesses who have relied on such claims
23338 we hope that the defendants will accept this decision and expect that we will receive relevant documents and call ms miers to testify in september
23339 i look forward to working with the white house and the justice department to coordinate the long overdue appearances
23340 that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law

23342 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
23343 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
23344 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington
23345 there is nothing more to this than the fact that he was describing that he was new to the political scene he was referring to the fact that he didnt come into the race with the history of others it is not about race
23346 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies
23347 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues hell continue to talk about
23348 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
23349 thats a definition of madness but thats what john mccain is offering
23350 what theyre going to argue is im too risky the real risk is that we miss the moment that we do not do whats needed because were afraid

23356 you know he is really trying to incite the wrong people but if he wants a fight hes going to have a fight this is an act of war its a declaration he is doing war on the people of this state who make california run so whoever advised him ought to be in an unemployment line right now if he thought of it himself shame on him
23357 it is an unwise and unfortunate move to cause economic strife to public servants and their families who are working hard and playing by the rules we are not going to let this decision get in the way of our mission which is to deliver a budget that reflects the values of californians

23391 decades long war to secure our nation and the global system
23392 the core responsibility of the department of defense is to defend the united states from attack upon its territory at home and to secure its interests abroad the u s armed forces protect the physical integrity of the country through an active layered defense they also deter attacks upon it directly and indirectly through deployments at sea in the air on land and in space however as the spreading web of globalization presents new opportunities and challenges the importance of planning to protect the homeland against previously unexpected threats increases on the one hand the flow of goods services people technology and information grows every year and with it the openness of american society on the other hand terrorists and others wishing us harm seek to exploit that openness small groups or individuals can harness chemical biological or even crude radiological or nuclear devices to cause extensive damage and harm similarly they can attack vulnerable points in cyberspace and disrupt commerce and daily life in the united states causing economic damage compromising sensitive information and materials and interrupting critical services such as power and information networks national security and domestic resources may be at risk and the department must help respond to protect lives and national assets the department will continue to be both bulwark and active protector in these areas yet in the long run the department of defense is neither the best source of resources and capabilities nor the appropriate authority to shoulder these tasks the comparative advantage and applicable authorities for action reside elsewhere in the u s government at other levels of government in the private sector and with partner nations
23393 for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the u s we must defeat violent extremism as a threat to our way of life as a free and open society and foster an environment inhospitable to violent extremists and all those who support them
23394 the best way to achieve security is to prevent war when possible and to encourage peaceful change within the international system our strategy emphasizes building the capacities of a broad spectrum of partners as the basis for long term security we must also seek to strengthen the resiliency of the international system to deal with conflict when it occurs
23395 deterrence is key to preventing conflict and enhancing security it requires influencing the political and military choices of an adversary dissuading it from taking an action by making its leaders understand that either the cost of the action is too great is of no use or unnecessary deterrence also is based upon credibility the ability to prevent attack respond decisively to any attack so as to discourage even contemplating an attack upon us and strike accurately when necessary we must build both our ability to withstand attack a fundamental and defensive aspect of deterrence and improve our resiliency beyond an attack an important change in planning for the myriad of future potential threats must be post attack recovery and operational capacity this too helps demonstrate that such attacks are futile as does our ability to respond with strength and effectiveness to attack we must consider which non lethal actions constitute an attack on our sovereignty and which may require the use of force in response we must understand the potential for escalation from non lethal to lethal confrontation and learn to calculate and manage the associated risks
23396 although improving the u s armed forces proficiency in irregular warfare is the defense departments top priority the united states does not have the luxury of preparing exclusively for such challenges even though the likelihood of interstate conflict has declined in recent years we ignore it at our peril

23423 the silver lining is that if i would be traded i dont think there is a team that would be rebuilding right now that would take a flier on me
23424 i think it would be a win now type thing if thats the case i look forward to that atmosphere whatever happens happens
23425 if its boston or wherever it might be thats the silver lining a little bit of sweet at this time of year i would definitely like to be part of that atmosphere

23443 the amount of energy delivered to the target by the hammer blow is equivalent to one half the mass of the head times the square of the heads speed at the time of impact while the energy delivered to the target increases linearly with mass it increases geometrically with the speed see the effect of the handle below high tech titanium heads are lighter and allow for longer handles thus increasing velocity and delivering more energy with less arm fatigue than that of a steel head hammer of the same weight as hammers must be used in many circumstances where the position of the person using them cannot be taken for granted trade offs are made for the sake of practicality in areas where one has plenty of room a long handle with a heavy head like a sledge hammer can deliver the maximum amount of energy to the target but clearly its unreasonable to use a sledge hammer to drive upholstery tacks thus the overall design has been modified repeatedly to achieve the optimum utility in a wide variety of situations
23444 the hammer blow is equivalent to one half the mass of the head times the square of the heads speed at the time of impact

23708 our politics is small when we need to be thinking big

23726 the data shows that as more people ride the streets get safer
23727 we work only to pay for the fuel we are not making money

23733 this is killing us because when transport prices rise everything becomes more expensive

23741 this is the first observation that really pins down that titan has a surface lake filled with liquid
23742 detection of liquid ethane in ontario lacus confirms a long held idea that lakes and seas filled with methane and ethane exist on titan
23743 raises expectations for exciting future lake discoveries by the infrared spectrometer
23744 we know the lake is liquid because it reflects essentially no light at 5 micron wavelengths
23745 it was hard for us to accept the fact that the feature was so black when we first saw it more than 99 9 percent of the light that reaches the lake never gets out again for it to be that dark the surface has to be extremely quiescent mirror smooth no naturally produced solid could be that smooth

23747 i got freaked out when i realized he doesnt understand our language
23748 if the kids remain illiterate in portuguese the language will unlikely be their tool of expression or thought
23749 they have lost portuguese skills and barely understand abstract concepts in the language
23750 its hard for them to express nuances in their feelings in portuguese
23751 portuguese will help them learn about their ancestors and develop their identities as brazilians
23752 without the language they will grow up being unaware of problems facing their own community
23753 when immigrant kids face challenges at public school due to their ethnicity their mother tongues will play a significant role in keeping their self esteem and sharing their feelings with compatriots going through similar situations
23754 because i hated some classmates calling me names and i want to learn portuguese and broaden my future choices
23755 research has shown that respect for ones language and culture will lead to positive identity formation and positive learning experiences
23756 its hard to keep up with class and i may transfer to a brazilian school after finishing the sixth grade
23757 these kids should focus on portuguese acquisition first and improve their intellectual capacities in the language to avoid falling behind in both
23758 the language focus should be shifted to japanese over generations
23759 teachers schools the communities and the country as a whole should create an environment in which cultural and linguistic diversity is seen as a rich resource enhancing the quality of schooling and life in general

23764 however we love the area so much that we built a smaller home on nearby property so we can remain here i hope that someone else will now be able to appreciate this home and what it has to offer beautiful nature peaceful open spaces and a home that can be loved all year long
23765 this is an outstanding occasion for us to work with such wonderful owners to help sell really remarkable pieces of property
23766 these homes and this land feature wonderfully unique details from intricate architecture to elegant and stunning gardens and pathways its been clear to us from the beginning that everything has been deeply cared for with the hope of allowing this region to be adored for generations to come

23971 do sens clinton biden hagel kennedy etc too want america to lose a war or do they simply disagree with mccains judgment
23972 there was obviously a point in time that you have to make a major decision we did and we were glad we did it hopefully it pays dividends were confident weve got one of the best hitters in baseball coming in here one of the best hitters of his generation from the right side
23973 hes a champion hes a winner and we really couldnt be happier with trying to make the club better at this point in time than to do this we wanted this player at least for the next two months and hopefully longer so were willing to take the chance and go with this guy
23974 we expect him to be here tomorrow and most likely play
23975 theo reached out to me in midmorning and wanted to gauge our interest and i said you know what we have an interest then we probably spent the next two plus hours hammering it out this wasnt on the board for very long
23976 manny being manny can also mean hell hit a lot of home runs and drive in a lot of runs

23978 i think hell be just fine manny is really a simple person he works extremely hard he just wants to play baseball and go home and be with his family how can you not respect and love a guy like that
23979 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
23980 mannys certainly not a simple personality thats for sure hes complex but ive seen him when he competes
23981 hes one of the greatest hitters ever to play the game its going to be a battle between us starting tonight
23982 the red sox dont deserve a player like me during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them

23997 we could build hundreds or thousands of optofluidic microscopes onto a single chip which would allow many organisms to be imaged and analyzed at once

24061 touch probe use of rfid chips straps and tags inherent antennas for rfid on printed circuit boards
24062 rf energy harvesting with multiple antennas in the same space
24063 powering autonomous harvesting with multiple antennas in the same space
24064 from both technical and medical viewpoints i am very surprised by this information and i question the validity of it
24065 most if not all rfid implants are silicon encased and hermetically sealed there can therefore be no question of a materials problem as pointed out in the article in practice many animals have had such implants in place for several years now quite a few humans too and i have not heard of one single case of there being a problem
24066 over the last 15 years millions of dogs and cats have safely received an implantable microchip with limited or no reports of adverse health reactions from this life saving product which was recently endorsed by the usda
24067 these chips are a well accepted and well respected means of global identification for pets in the veterinary community veterinarians would not continue to prescribe pet microchips if they believed they presented significant risk of malignant tumors in dogs and cats
24068 since learning of the ap article we have discovered two studies from our manufacturer
24069 we recognize we have a corporate responsibility to review these studies to look at other studies to do new studies if necessary and do what it appropriate after reviewing all of the information in all regards and we intend to do this
24070 ordinarily in life most people are affected by radio signals of the type in question every day yet there has not to my knowledge been any question that radio waves cause cancer
24071 i can only conclude therefore that a these results are simply bogus b possibly there is an attempt at industrial espionage or c maybe there were some other factors in the study that we havent been told about e g the rats were also being fed a strange chemical at the same time
24072 one thing i am not clear about is how long these purported results have been known
24073 the study mentions 1996 if the results have been known since that time then dow chemical and the practitioners in the study are highly irresponsible individuals to have waited till now to say something
24074 the fda is overseen by the department of health and human services which at the time of verichips approval was headed by tommy thompson
24075 two weeks after the devices approval took effect on jan 10 2005 thompson left his cabinet post and within five months was a board member of verichip corp and applied digital solutions he was compensated in cash and stock options
24076 and if you look back at my record you will find that there has never been any improprieties whatsoever
24077 i have no interest in or with any rfid company of any type my experience has always been purely investigative scientific
24078 the answer i have given is therefore purely scientific no industrial company financial interest has swayed me one way or another
24079 the guide is the outgrowth of a series of questions that have been raised to the fda about the use of rfid technology
24080 for example sponsors and participants of various rfid pilot studies have come to us asking whether we were concerned about the effects of electromagnetic energy on products whether we considered rfid to be labeling whether we believed that any good manufacturing practices were implicated by the use of rfid
24081 the point of this is to further any counterfeiting reports that the fda issued last year or early this year in which we describe a need for a number of new procedures to protect the drug supply against counterfeit drugs and one of those was to encourage the development of rfid technology as a track and trace protection for pharmaceuticals
24082 contemporary medievalism is now tarred by the same brush that in conservative circles continues to dismiss cultural studies as mere chat about television cinema and the internet that is the accusation that there is too much pleasure too little work in its study

24115 i do not understand the values that would suggest during a time of war we provide tax breaks for people making over 1 million a year but we cannot afford to provide the health care our veterans deserve and the housing our troops need i believe our veterans military families and the american family will be as offended by this veto threat as i am

24182 he has long controlled the state assemblys transportation committee with an iron fist micromanaging new york citys traffic from afar and for bewildering reasons
24183 the only real clue is that mr gantt apparently decided years ago that he does not like cameras in public places too big brother
24184 it makes no sense for one upstate legislator to strangle progress and safety in new york city
24185 this should be a matter decided by new yorks mayor and city council since it is not assembly speaker sheldon silver and his democratic majority should replace committee chairmen like mr gantt who have clearly been there too long if he wont the voters should
24186 todays decision is a huge win in protecting new york states great lakes from invasive species and pollution that for too long have threatened our local ecosystems economies and our health

24191 while recently appearing on television governor paterson said that new yorkers will do well with democrats running the state senate and with malcolm smith as majority leader
24192 who but republicans desperately holding on to a one vote majority and their friends would try to distort the governors words polls show that new yorkers are pleased with governor patersons leadership and more concerned with issues rather than political gossip new yorkers care about economic development lowering property taxes and job creation all issues that senate democrats led by malcolm smith have championed

24212 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
24213 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
24214 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
24215 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
24216 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
24217 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
24218 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
24219 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
24220 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
24221 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
24222 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
24223 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
24224 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
24225 i was worried that it would sort of trivialize what we do
24226 it was very riveting television i thought even though ive been doing this 26 years i was spellbound by some of the stuff i saw the things i dont get to see like in the back with the kids in the detention center visiting their parents
24227 it is important to keep citizens informed about the issues facing the juvenile justice system a national broadcast produced by a respected journalist is one avenue to promote that understanding
24228 the longer format programming such as documentaries or our own webcasts seem better suited to provide the most complete or inclusive coverage and accurate information
24229 the court is open to the possibility that there are more opportunities for allowing cameras in the courtroom
24230 we have to be in hong kong in about three weeks find some place we can go thats warmer
24231 it can be stressful for kids when mom and dad are running around trying to pack load up the car and finish last minute details
24232 instead of letting them get agitated hire a sitter to hang out with the kids for an hour or two while you get ready to leave
24233 my needs change as the kids get older so after each trip i update my list and then put it back in the suitcase
24234 having a packing list helps keep me from throwing tons of things in the suitcase that i dont need and it helps me identify the things that never get used so i travel a little bit lighter each trip
24235 for last minute travel were finding so many travelers choosing to stay close to home and explore their own neighborhood
24236 the best deals can be right in your own backyard
24237 shell vacations along with many other organizations offers gas cards food and beverage credits and even discounts toward future stays
24238 we know consumers want to travel but theyre looking for ways to ease the pain at the pump were packing in more value added offerings such as free groceries during their stay organized family activities and deep discounts for local residents
24239 looking for interesting products to review that dont really haveanywhere else to be reviewed for our second book
24240 i have tested the computers and am happy with their performance
24241 they are wireless internet based designs and need not be connected to fixed lines to reduce costs they do not have hard discs you use a thumb drive instead
24242 i wish i could live on the same street with the kids and see them grow up with the 20something and see them select a mate and settle down with the adventure and think up a new adventure every day

24251 that said the problem plurk faces is the exact same problem that mixx faces though the site has a better service they cant match the same number of registrations or activity as market leaders simply because of the first mover advantage people either find it too complicated its not or are too lazy they definitely are to transfer their entire network over to a new service the problem is that no one wants to move to a new site unless their entire network of friends moves too this means unless there is a mass migration a majority of the people though they are definitely testing it wont stay with the service in the long term in fact even though i really like plurk i dont use it as frequently as twitter simply because all my friends are using twitter more frequently

24264 all market participants receive and act on all of the relevant information investment strategy would be better than a coin toss proponents of the efficient market theory believe that there is perfect information in the stock market this means that whatever information is available about a stock to one investor is available to all investors except of course insider information but insider trading is illegal since everyone has the same information about a stock the price of a stock should reflect the knowledge and expectations of all investors the bottom line is that an investor should not be able to beat the market since there is no way for him her to know something about a stock that isnt already reflected in the stocks price

24310 its truly remarkable that unicef is still able to make a difference in the health education and overall well being of somali children

24338 the great danger is that policy becomes divorced from events on the ground the only responsible course is to ensure that decisions on troop levels and other matters reflect the demands of the battlefield to reduce forces ignorant of or despite the consequences would be to risk disaster
24339 senator obama has stated his intention to withdraw u s forces from iraq on a fixed timetable and without almost any consideration for facts on the ground and events in the region a policy of effectively unconditional withdrawal from iraq raises troubling questions through this on the ground assessment members of vff are committed to providing fact based analysis of critical policy decisions
24340 the story is a long complicated one winding its way from china to france by way of the first world war the oil cartel the pharmaceutical cartel and iraq to its final destination a syringe full of something claiming to be a vaccine against the newly deadly avian flu
24341 our best intelligence estimate is that pandemic avian flu has already been created through genetic engineering in the united states fusing the deadly genome of the 1918 pandemic misnamed the spanish flu with the dna of the innocuous h5n1 virus in a growth medium of human kidney cells according to the national institutes of health and the vaccines manufacturer
24342 a basic virological fact that the public has not been told is that it is impossible to make a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist
24343 we can see that the pharmaceutical industry and us government are actively preparing for an avian flu pandemic through their own promotional literature and propaganda
24344 the manufacturers website contains a document which clearly illustrates their business model and how the company successfully capitalizes on the immensely profitable worldwide vaccination market
24345 given the shockingly obvious lack of any threat from an un weaponized h5n1 virus how can we explain the bush administration spending billions of dollars preparing each of the 50 states for what it drums into us is the

24368 all the filipinos who go on the tour usually say i never knew all these filipino places were in historic filipinotown
24369 and the non filipinos say to me that they never knew that there is such a rich filipino history in los angeles it makes me feel good it makes me want to do more of these tours
24370 we want to educate everybody about our rich history here
24371 the filipinos who were here already had a spirit to help the new filipino immigrants these filipino immigrants were mostly young fresh hardworking and very ambitious they would come to this area and facla would help them get adjusted
24372 our very own filipino author carlos bulosan used to frequent places here in historic filipinotown
24373 the influx of new immigrants and the upward mobility of filipinos many moved out into other areas of los angeles
24374 i remember we had a filvote forum for the city council

24668 he shot annapolis yesterday when he declared that there is no possibility of reaching an agreement by the end of the year he destroyed annapolis by declaring that jerusalem is not part of the discussion and today by this resignation probably hes providing the ammunition to kill finally the annapolis process completely olmert is finishing with failures but his biggest failure is that he has proven that up til now there is no partner for peace in israel
24669 it is decided not to ban the party the court decided to impose partial financial penalties the party will not be banned but everybody should evaluate the decision very carefully the decision should be accepted as a very strong warning for akp six court members voted yes four people voted for imposing financial penalties and one person voted for rejection of the case

24710 john mccain and george bush both said that if iraq as a sovereign government stated that it was time for us to start withdrawing our troops then they would respect the wishes of that sovereign government and given that i think its also in our strategic interests it certainly strikes me that we shouldnt be writing a status of forces agreement for example that locks in a long term occupation

24769 fusion centers are part of a much larger trend here a trend of our nations movement towards a surveillance society where our every move and our every transaction our every communication is scanned and scrutinized for signs of quote unquote suspicious behavior and that that kind of vision for how to do law enforcement how to stop terrorism becomes a justification for really keeping tabs on all of us in our everyday lives

24786 although an honest belief need not be reasonable such a belief is easier to establish where there is a reasonable basis for it
24787 the absence of specific intent negates the charge of torture
24788 these documents supply further evidence if any were needed that the justice department authorized the cia to torture prisoners in its custody the justice department twisted the law and in some cases ignored it altogether in order to permit interrogators to use barbaric methods that the us once prosecuted as war crimes
24789 no one welcomes war i recognize the enormous difficulties in afghanistan but my country and yours have a stake in seeing that natos first mission beyond europes borders is a success for the people of afghanistan and for our shared security the work must be done america cannot do this alone
24790 i would rather speak at a rally or a gathering any place outside the united states after i am president of the united states but thats a judgment that senator obama and the american people will make
24791 i feel like justice has been served and in all truth this war criminal the oppressor known as luciano benjamin menendez is going to rot in jail which is exactly what he deserves

24796 this decision means the president can pick up any person in the country citizen or legal resident and lock them up for years without the most basic safeguard in the constitution the right to a criminal trial
24797 contrary to everything the canadian public has been told about omar khadr the tapes do not show a dangerous terrorist but instead a frightened wounded canadian boy pleading for help from canadian officials instead of helping they casually dismiss his claims of abuse and mistreatment and tell him that they will do nothing for him
24798 we are hoping that the canadian public will recognize that you put aside any concerns of guilt or innocence that has to be determined in a properly constituted court which of course is not guantanamo bay and look at compassion as we feel the children have a special significance in society this kid has suffered enough this kid needs to come home this kid is not a terrorist
24799 i heard somebody say well its going to take seven years well if wed have done it seven years ago wed be having a different conversation today im not suggesting wed have completely created a you know changed the dynamics in the world but it certainly would have been wed have been using more of our own oil and sending less money overseas

24805 ive been there too many times ive met too many times with him and i know what they want they want it based on conditions and of course theyd like to have us out thats what happens when you win wars

24819 then began the saddest procession i have ever witnessed which the public would never see because cameras were not allowed past the perimeter of the compound driven single file in groups of 10 shackled at the wrists waist and ankles chains dragging as they shuffled through the slaughterhouse workers were brought in for arraignment sat and listened through headsets to the interpreted initial appearance before marching out again to be bused to different county jails only to make room for the next row of 10 they appeared to be uniformly no more than 5 ft tall mostly illiterate guatemalan peasants with mayan last names some in tears others with faces of worry fear and embarrassment

24827 i wouldnt even be surprised if that in some polls that you saw a little bit of a dip as a consequence weve been out of the country for a week people are worried about gas prices theyre worried about home foreclosures so the reason that i thought this trip was important was i am convinced that many of the issues that we face at home are not going to be solved as effectively unless we have strong partners abroad
24828 the conviction gives his victims hope that he will soon be brought to justice for his crimes in haiti that included the murder and rape and other torture of thousands more
24829 we strongly condemn this decision by the defense ministry to allow new settlements in the west bank in the jordan valley this is not the interest of the israeli people and the israeli public to have new settlements while we are having negotiations with the palestinians about having the two states

24831 did you use did people say call sean call bill call whoever did you do that as a regular thing
24832 certainly certainly it wasnt necessarily something i was doing but it was something that we at the white house yes were doing and getting them talking points and making sure they knew where we were coming from
24833 no no this is important you were using these commentators as your spokespeople

24844 as we said in 2000 the age of defeat has passed and the age of victory is upon us this people this nation this country has today given a clear message to the world to both friend and foe that it cannot be defeated
24845 the israelis certainly lost that war they did not get their prisoners back not until now and theyre getting them back dead more than 1 000 lebanese civilians and more than 160 israelis most of them soldiers all died for absolutely nothing and thats what todays prisoner exchanges prove

24847 it is a palpable demonstration that we can negotiate like brothers that we can trust that we can advance together that we can overcome this silliness of competition between nations so we can advance together the cooperation between nations
24848 when the officer confessed his mistake to his superiors he said that as the helicopter was landing he saw such a quantity of guerrillas that he became very nervous and that he was afraid for his life and that he took out of his pocket the piece of cloth with the symbol of the international red cross committee logo that he carried in his pocket and put it on his bulletproof vest we regret that this has occurred
24849 when a public system fails repeatedly to meet these minimal objectives parents ask only for a choice in their education of their children some parents some parents may choose a better public school some may choose a private school many will choose a charter school no entrenched bureaucracy or union should deny parents that choice and children that opportunity

24870 as part of the war on terror for the first time in its history the united states has sanctioned government officials to physically and psychologically torment american held captives making torture the official law of the land in all but name
24871 bad news the reason were not getting better intelligence part of the reasoning anyway is that about a third of the people are innocent
24872 do you know anything about islamic radicals do you speak arabic have you got any background in this area
24873 the allegation that i provided assistance in the process of torture is completely false
24874 i gave a three hour lecture sponsored by sere the survival evasion resistance escape branch of the american armed forces at the san diego naval base in may 2002
24875 i have not worked under government contract or any other contract on any aspect of interrogation or any aspect of torture
24876 i have had no contact at all with the american psychological association about their relevant policies most importantly i strongly disapprove of torture and have never and would never provide assistance in its process
24877 if psychologists have to be there in order to keep detainees from being killed then those conditions are so horrendous that the only moral and ethical thing to do is to protest by leaving
24878 i am ashamed we are even having this conversation of course waterboarding is torture
24879 if it was done to me i would think it was torture
24880 you know you may acknowledge these laws or not but these laws exist
24881 are there weapons of mass destruction in iraq and are there connections between al qaeda and saddam hussein

24888 oh theres good faith reasons not to impeach or to criminally prosecute
24889 well there may be legal excuses as to why he did that

24896 us presidential candidate barack obama talks about sixteen months that we think would be the right time frame for a withdrawal with the possibility of slight changes
24897 artificially prolonging the tenure of us troops in iraq would cause problems
24898 sen obama conveyed that he is committed to supporting afghanistan and to continue the war against terrorism with vigor
24899 to see young people like this who are doing such excellent work with so much dedication and pride just makes me feel good about the country and i want to make sure that everybody back home understands how much pride people take in their work here and how much sacrifice people are making its outstanding
24900 the situation is getting worse here even worse than iraq if the us government sends more troops here the violence will increase for example when we see a group of us soldiers walking here it doesnt make us feel safe our afghan forces are capable enough to ensure the security of afghanistan the us government should focus on other needs of afghans not the military
24901 there have not been any changes to the lives of ordinary afghans the visits and presence of foreigners has not changed the lives of poor afghans i returned from iran after twenty years there i had the best life when i was in iran now i have work like an animal in my country in order to feed my family my life is worse now what is the benefit of these western officials coming and going
24902 you said he was the most extreme member of the senate i think is the quote
24903 you mean you really think hes an extremist i mean hes clearly liberal
24904 oh i dont know all i know is his voting record and thats what people usually judge their elected representatives by
24905 btselem received this morning footage filmed in the village of nilin approximately two weeks ago showing an israeli soldier firing a rubber coated steal bullet at a palestinian the palestinian has his hands tied behind his back and his eyes covered and the soldier is firing at him from very close range from approximately a meter and a half away this whole event happens in the presence of a high ranking officer a lieutenant colonel

24917 what i saw was abhorrently graphic yet far too important for the world to ignore i present images that provide an uncensored view of a terrible event and some small measure of dignity to those who lost their lives
24918 how can things change if all that comes out of iraq are sanitized white washed images of war designed for mainstream media outlets who focus on making money not on the quality and truth in what they report
24919 im not worried about my own safety im here to do my job im here to document
24920 well theres nothing in the embed rules that say you cant show someone whos identifiable as a marine it says no identifiable features you know to identify that person from you know another person but actually showing an injured soldier or a dead soldier is not something that is barred in the embed rules
24921 by posting the images and your commentary you violated 14 h and o of the news media agreement you signed
24922 by providing detailed information of the effectiveness of the attack and response of us forces to it you have put all us forces in iraq at greater risk for harm
24923 the marines have not been able to prove anything that they have claimed against you

24926 we were trying to get to the bulldozers we were risking no one and it seems that with the return to tactics and strategies of the first intifada by this village and the movement against the wall it seems that the army is returning to the old commands as well of breaking arms and legs of demonstrators
24927 im here visiting with the good people of nilin on this the fourth anniversary of the landmark advisory opinion and ruling by the international court of justice ruling which as you all know requires cessation of building of the wall destroying or removing the part of it that had been built and also dealing with the issue as a form of colonization and settlement activity with all that comes with that with all that comes with that by way of violation of rights of palestinians including importantly human rights
24928 were very pleased that the judge recognized on the record that my father is neither a threat to the community nor a flight risk we are hoping that immigration and customs enforcement will do the right thing and release him
24929 im not going to retract any of it every word i said was true
24930 we are also sending a message to iran that we will defend american interests and defend the interests of our allies weve done that both by i think you know that in the gulf area the united states has enhanced its security capacity its security presence and we are working closely with all of our allies to make certain that they are capable of defending themselves and we take very very strongly our obligation to help our allies defend themselves and no one should be confused about that

24936 im here on this trip to reaffirm the special relationship between israel and the united states my abiding commitment to israels security and my hope that i can serve as an effective partner whether as a united states senator or as a president in bringing about a more lasting peace in the region
24937 these positions mean that there is no minimal hope to any change in the us foreign policy towards the arab israeli conflict and this means that we are in front of one american policy and the palestinian people should depend on their own and on the arab and muslim world in facing this opposing american policy which both the democratic and republican parties are adopting
24938 unless chevron is out of there the united states doesnt have the moral authority to tell other countries to get out
24939 regarding the conspiracy issue president morales addressed over the course of twenty minutes and with the aid of documents the political operation carried out and being carried out by the us embassy in bolivia the bolivian government president morales himself has requested the united states halt with its political conspiring in bolivia and instead has posed working together to conspire against poverty
24940 the question is do you want to play russian roulette with your brain i dont know that cell phones are dangerous but i dont know that they are safe
24941 this should outrage every american that fox uses hateful language to talk about the person who may be the first black president but the obamas are not the only targets foxs pattern is race baiting and fear mongering regularly focuses on black leaders black institutions and ordinary black people like when they used the solemn occasion of coretta scott kings funeral to call black leaders racist thats not acceptable its offensive to black americans its offensive to all americans thats why i wrote on my new album a song called sly fox watch what you watchin fox keeps feeding us toxin stop sleepin start thinkin

24969 with todays vote the government has been given a green light to expand its power to spy on americans and run roughshod over the constitution
24970 the fact is theyve just tested a missile that has a pretty extended range so my view in the first instance is weve been saying as weve talked about missile defense in europe that there is a real threat and it seems to me that the test this morning underscores that
24971 are we any closer to a military confrontation with iran
24972 but in terms of the missile test i see it as evidence that the missile threat is not an imaginary one and that those who say that there is no iranian missile threat against which we should be building missile defenses perhaps ought to talk to the iranians about their claims even about the distance and the range of the missiles that they test fired
24973 part of what we have to do is get the europeans the chinese the russians all to recognize that its in nobodys interests including irans i believe to have a nuclear weapon that could trigger a nuclear arms race in the region and thats something that i intend to make a number one priority when im in the white house making sure they dont have that nuclear capability
24974 its time for action and its time to make the iranians understand that this kind of violation of international treaties this kind of threatening of their neighbors this kind of continued military activity is not without cost
24975 see barack been talking down to black people on this faith based i wanna cut his beep off
24976 if anything ive said in a hot mic statement thats attributed as distraction i offer apology for that because i dont want harm or hurt to come to this campaign it represents too much of the dreams of so many who have paid such great prices and im very sensitive to what that means
24977 my appeal was for the moral content of his message to not only deal with the personal and moral responsibility of black males but to deal with the collective moral responsibility of government and the public policy
24978 i simply do not feel it is appropriate to honor a person whose epitaph of government service was to have voted against or blocked every civil rights issue that came before the us congress his doctrine of negativity hate and prejudice cost north carolina and our nation much that we may never regain
24979 on the agenda is the necessity of a general pay increase salaries and pensions to compensate not only the constantly increasing cost of living but also inflation

24985 though the chinese have also recently begun investing in the countrys oil sector u s companies exxonmobil amerada hess chevron texaco and marathon oil have played the most significant role a report by the international monetary fund notes that u s oil companies receive by far the most generous tax and profit sharing provisions in the region congressional hearings recently revealed how u s oil companies paid hundreds of millions of dollars destined to state treasuries directly into the dictators private bank accounts a senate report faulted u s oil companies for making substantial payments to or entering into business ventures with government officials and their family members
24986 the irony of the relative silence of congress and the bush administration regarding the human rights abuses and the undemocratic nature of obiangs regime is that due to the critical role of u s economic investment and security assistance the united states has far more leverage over the government of equatorial guinea than it does over zimbabwe
24987 equatorial guinea receives u s government funding and training through imet which is international military education and training program in addition the private u s firm military professional resources incorporated mpri founded by former senior pentagon officials who cite the regimes friendliness to u s strategic and economic interests plays a key role in the countrys internal security apparatus

24993 the goal is to end the presence of foreign troops
24994 rather than a breakthrough the g8s announcement on 2050 is another stalling tactic that does nothing to lower the risk faced by millions of poor people right now
24995 the world faces three simultaneous crises a food crisis a climate crisis and a development crisis the three crises are deeply interconnected and need to be addressed as such
24996 now the bush administrations new policy is to wait another ten years
24997 he loved the picture dont get me wrong but he just couldnt get over the war he wasnt joseph anymore joseph never came home
24998 i just feel this war has become so sanitized that it was important to show
24999 provided the enemy with specific information on the effectiveness of the attack
25000 france is one of the ten countries in the world with the highest number of endangered species mainly due to what has happened in its overseas territories and once again the risk of these numbers increasing in the european overseas territories is likely to increase with the growing threat of climate change
25001 the ticket was for trespassing he said if i came back into the plaza i would be arrested and taken to jail the sign says mccain bush now in a republican event why is that offensive why would republicans who voted for bush find it offensive that a sign says bush mccain or mccain bush

25005 every day he reports from a war zone where he is also a prisoner his homeland gaza is surrounded starved attacked forgotten he is a profoundly humane witness to one of the great injustices of our time he is the voice of the voiceless
25006 is there anyone who has been to the netherlands to france to sweden to greece and to the united kingdom and come back to gaza strip gaza is a dirty place why do you come back to gaza gaza is a dirty place and the people there are dirty why do you come to live in such a place where there is no electricity there is no light and there is darkness and there is shortages of fuel and there is lots of difficulties why dont you live in france instead

25022 i thought that your dream is like the other gazans young men who get out of gaza and never come back again
25023 well thats not my dream i want to come back because gaza is my home and i want to be a voice for the voiceless
25024 do you think those people are going to help you

25029 mohammed you know that greece is not a friend of israel you know that greece is a friend of the palestinians only the palestinians and not israel
25030 well i dont really care and thats none of my business its a country i have received an invitation from the parliament in greece and i went there to speak after or before i went to collect my prize
25031 mohammed is unconscious and he cannot at all do anything or sign any paper

25033 listen its none of your business dont tell the dutch that mohammed is in this car just take him to the hospital and thats it dont tell anybody about what happened
25034 the former ambassador jan wijenberg said this is by no means an isolated incident but part of a long term strategy to demolish palestinian social economic and cultural life i am aware of the possibility that mohammed omer might be murdered by israeli snipers or bomb attack in the near future

25038 that position has not changed i have not equivocated on that position i am not searching for maneuvering room with respect to that position
25039 i dont think that mental distress qualifies as the health of the mother i think it has to be a serious physical issue that arises in pregnancy where there are real significant problems to the mother carrying that child to term

25041 we have contributed the least to climate change but we are carrying the heavy burden of solving the climate change problem and so we would like them to ensure that we are included in the negotiations of the climate change convention so that we can contribute more substantially in shaping solutions
25042 the reality is in africa every single day 6 000 people die from hiv aids alone another 7 000 people die from malaria another 2 000 3 000 die from tuberculosis if those numbers of deaths were happening in europe or north america we are convinced the g8 would long time ago have found the money to address these issues so we want to see the same kind of urgency

25087 i kept playing the movie over in my head many times had i been pressured had i been stubborn today with the perspective of years behind me i feel it was my destiny i feel that i had to live through what i lived through that i had to find out what i found out i have a ph d in the farc that i hope will be useful to those of us who want to help with all this i think there are moments in life in which one is at a crossroads between what one wants to do and what one has to do
25088 i dont want to answer that question from an emotional perspective because this is such a big blow to the farc that it would be easy to say that the farc is destroyed i simply want to give you testimony of what i lived through since a year ago it has been hard for supplies to arrive we have had little to eat very little variety in the food no fruit no greens thats a signal that the logistics could be going through difficulty

25091 i have always said that all options are on the table but the first option for the united states is to solve this problem diplomatically ive also made it clear that you cant solve a problem diplomatically unless there are other people at the table with you and that is why we have been pursuing multilateral diplomacy when it comes to convincing the iranians that the free world is sincere about you know insisting that they not have the technologies necessary to develop a nuclear weapon and were making progress along those lines

25096 alright you know what we wont come in there at the high rates we dont want to get on the radar screen in that respect well just come right under and well start to look for ways to make loans with lots of bells and whistles and lots of fees attached to them where we can come under the radar screen and start to create this kind of market of potential problems

25141 through these initial offers we hope to increase production of these oilfields to about 1 5 million barrels per day in addition to current production which is 2 5 million barrels per day the ministry is seeking to increase production from now until contracts are put into effect until it reaches 4 5 million barrels per day in the next five years

25145 irans will and authority to the enemies that have threatened iran with harsh language in recent weeks
25146 we face with the iranians and so do our allies and friends a growing missile threat that is getting ever longer and ever deeper and where the iranian appetite for nuclear technology as to this point is still unchecked and its hard for me to believe that an american president is not going to want to have the capability to defend our territory the territory of our allies whether they are in europe or whether they are in the middle east
25147 this is not good for our republic nor for europe nor for peace and security all around the world people are against the radar for different reasons radar and missiles have no security nor defensive reasoning
25148 every military action causes a military response this is the fundamental rule this is what military people are about if there is a military action if there is a change in strategic posture there is a counter change of strategic posture you can read it in every military textbook so there is nothing surprising there are not even questions to be asked about
25149 we cant have a memorandum of understanding with foreign forces unless it has dates and clear horizons determining the departure of foreign forces were unambiguously talking about their departure we are waiting impatiently for the day when the last foreign soldier leaves iraq
25150 we have great confidence that the political leadership in iraq would not take an action that would destabilize the country
25151 let me first of all talk about the broader issue this whole notion that i am shifting to the center or that im flip flopping or this or that or the other you know the people who say this apparently havent been listening to me ive been organizing with churches for years in the community and so the notion that somehow thats me trying to look like im you know more centered more centrist is just not true dont assume that if i dont agree with you on something that it must be because im doing that politically i may just disagree with you

25154 after fourteen months of study including seven meetings around the country and interviews with more than forty experts on this matter our commission has unanimously concluded that the central law governing this critical decision that is the war powers resolution of 1973 is ineffective and it should be repealed and it should be replaced however with a better law

25158 while our management team and agency employees have helped the district cut its deficit and improve its academic performance
25159 the instability of the school board remains a chronic problem for the district
25160 were going to have a press conference at 11 a m saturday at that time were going to reveal some facts thats going to be quite stunning to the community
25161 being a board member it saddens me that we have come to this point but we cannot continuously fight the hands that fed us tea and expect smooth transition
25162 i will stay prayerful and hopeful that our district pulls out of the situation it is currently in
25163 ill be working with the justice department because rightly so this has to be pre cleared
25164 i will be very carefully watching and asking the hard questions as to whether or not this is a legitimate move
25165 it is one of the few remaining predominantly black districts but more importantly it represents a very proud community it represents a community that loves education and has generated outstanding graduates over the years
25166 when i started in the district it was a mixture of blacks and whites and hispanics ive seen the white flight but the district still was able to stand
25167 i cant tell you how many superintendents ive seen but they go and the district still survives theres been times when the fbi came and carted off boxes but the district still stood
25168 i know if we dont have the funding from the tea we will not be able to sustain ourselves if this is what it will take to get the students well educated then we stand behind that decision
25169 it should have been a long time ago before we got in such a bad situation here but at least theyre doing something before we lose all the kids
25170 it is important to note that the commissioners decision deals with governance issues and does not affect north forest isd students or staff

25281 i completely believe that a game could come out and be more successful than wow im hoping that were working on it right now
25282 i think a lot of other companies have had great opportunities to do what wow has done usually for whatever reason they miss the mark
25283 i actually feel really bad a lot of times when new mmos come out and dont do really well because im not thinking of it from a business perspective i know what its like to be a developer on a team that you believe in on a game that you just love and for some reason you dont get enough time or someone makes a bad decision everybodys making a lot of small choices and when those go wrong your game ends up not successful
25284 not making choices based upon being different but making choices based upon whats good for your game
25285 if there was an mmo out there that had a tone different from wow but was executed as well i actually think there could be a huge audience for that when i get disappointed its because i dont see that level of execution
25286 the same challenge is on us are we going to make the right decisions i dont believe that just because we made wow were guaranteed on the next mmo that we make to have the same success

25304 kerrys speech on economy at georgetown is likely to move onto the topic of iraq we should take the beginning of kerrys speech see if it contains new information aside from a promise to create 10 million jobs and see if other news at that time is more compelling it is not required to take it start to finish

25308 the story is a long complicated one winding its way from china to france by way of the first world war the oil cartel the pharmaceutical cartel and iraq to its final destination a syringe full of something claiming to be a vaccine against the newly deadly avian flu
25309 our best intelligence estimate is that pandemic avian flu has already been created through genetic engineering in the united states fusing the deadly genome of the 1918 pandemic misnamed the spanish flu with the dna of the innocuous h5n1 virus in a growth medium of human kidney cells according to the national institutes of health and the vaccines manufacturer some virologists believe that this would insure that the man made mutant virus recognizes human cells and knows how to invade them
25310 a basic virological fact that the public has not been told is that it is impossible to make a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist public relations efforts to the contrary if a vaccine is being made against the avian flu virus in its pandemic form that means that the pandemic virus must already exist period end of discussion so the fact that the avian flu vaccine is already being manufactured in china by a wholly owned subsidiary of the french arm of the cartel is not only peculiar but at the very least sinister
25311 we can see that the pharmaceutical industry and us government are actively preparing for an avian flu pandemic through their own promotional literature and propaganda
25312 the manufacturers website contains a document which clearly illustrates their business model and how the company successfully capitalizes on the immensely profitable worldwide vaccination market
25313 given the shockingly obvious lack of any threat from an un weaponized h5n1 virus how can we explain the bush administration spending billions of dollars preparing each of the 50 states for what it drums into us is the

25334 ce nouveau processus que nous mettons en place va enlever une grosse partie de l l ment subjectif des pr c dentes ouvertures de nouvelles extensions lapproche est compl tement nouvelle si le demandeur peut montrer que son extension ne risque pas de causer du tort quelquun alors cette derni re sera accept e cest un changement dattitude radical par rapport au processus pr c dent o les candidats taient soumis des v rifications aussi longues que minutieuses
25335 louverture des tld nest pas pour licann un moyen de gagner de largent nous chercherons uniquement rentrer dans nos frais par rapport ce que cette op ration nous a d j co t e comme nous ne savons pas encore combien nous allons recevoir de dossier de candidature nous ne pouvons donc forc ment pas savoir combien de temps il nous faudra pour rentrer dans nos frais pour linstant nous envisageons des frais administratifs li s au d p t dun dossier de candidature dans les quelques centaines de milliers de dollars us par la suite en fonction des dossiers re us nous pourrons envisager de baisser ces frais certes cela veut un peu dire que les premiers dossiers financeront en partie le lancement de lop ration mais celle ci sera tout fait transparente nos comptes les dossiers nos d cisions tout sera publi
25336 ne nous y trompons pas cette journ e est historique pour linternet mais quand verra t on vraiment de nouveaux tld sur internet licann doit maintenant finaliser les modalit s de mise en application de cette op ration y compris les conditions dacc s et les r gles de d p t il nous faudra environ 4 mois pour le faire ensuite nous pr voyons dans nous lancer dans une campagne de communication globale galement de 4 mois car il est primordial que cette lib ralisation soit connue dun maximum de monde et ne prenne personne par surprise nous pouvons donc nous attendre pouvoir commencer recevoir les candidatures en avril ou mai 2009 nous esp rons pouvoir traiter les plus simples cest dire celles qui ne posent pas de probl mes juridiques sp cifiques par exemple en 90 voir 120 jours ainsi les premiers tld pourraient ouvrir avant la fin 2009
25337 nous lavons dit le processus se veut aussi simple que possible ainsi nous retenons uniquement 4 crit res de refus les extensions propos es devront respecter les droits existants dont le droit des marques ne pas entretenir la confusion avec des extensions existantes par exemple un kom serait trop proche du com si elles repr sentes des communaut s ces derni res doivent tre daccord respecter lordre public et moral au del de ces crit res nous nexercerons aucun choix sur les dossiers ceux qui nous sont pr sent s seront accept s
25338 techniquement on doit pouvoir en cr er au moins 5 000 et peut tre beaucoup plus
25339 environ 25 personnes ont travaill licann sur ce dossier pendant pr s de neuf mois et nous avons d j d pens au moins 10 millions de dollars pour valuer la faisabilit de cette lib ralisation
25340 mais il nous reste maintenant norm ment de travail pour rentrer dans les d tails de la mise en uvre de cette lib ralisation par exemple combien cela co tera t il pour d poser une demande de nouvelle extension aujourdhui on ne peut r pondre avec pr cision notre but est davoir une op ration neutre en terme de co ts pour licann et nous estimons que ce dossier nous co tera au final dans les 20 millions de dollars il nous faudra donc attendre de conna tre ces co ts de mani re d finitive avant de pouvoir fixer les frais de d p t

25601 you are not your own you were bought with a price so glorify god in your bodies
25602 you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your fathers with the precious blood of christ
25603 many will follow their licentiousness and because of them the way of truth will be reviled
25604 it is actually reported that there is immorality among you and of a kind that is not found among pagans for a man is living with his fathers wife and you are arrogant
25605 for uttering loud boasts of folly they entice with licentious passions of the flesh men who have barely escaped those who live in error
25606 they indulge in the lust of defiling passion and despise authority they are bold and self willed
25607 to escape from the corruption that is in the world because of passion
25608 in their greed they will exploit you with false words
25609 its ok for kids to experiment sexually its ok for a couple to live together out of wedlock its ok for a husband and wife to gratify their desires with a prostitute or another persons partner
25610 they promise them freedom but they themselves are slaves of corruption
25611 if god did not spare the angels when they sinned but cast them into hell and committed them to pits of nether gloom or chains of darkness to be kept until judgment
25612 lake of fire and brimstone to be tormented day and night forever and ever
25613 depart from me you cursed into eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels
25614 if he did not spare the ancient world but preserved noah a herald of righteousness with seven other persons when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly
25615 if the false teachers do not learn the lesson from the fallen angels let them learn it from the flood
25616 from of old their condemnation has not been idle and their destruction is not sleeping
25617 if by turning the cities of sodom and gomorrah to ashes he condemned them to extinction and made them an example to those who were to be ungodly and if he rescued righteous lot greatly distressed by the licentiousness of the wicked for by what that righteous man saw and heard as he lived among them he was vexed in his righteous soul day after day with their lawless deeds
25618 if the case of the fallen angels and the case of noahs generation do not deter people from following the false teachers then surely the destruction of sodom and gomorrah will wake them up to gods wrath for these cities were judged for the very licentiousness that the false teachers commend
25619 so the lord knows how to rescue the godly from trial like noah and lot and he knows how to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment and especially those who indulge in the lust of defiling passion and despise authority
25620 then you will never fall and there will be richly provided for you an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ
25621 do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal for where your treasure is there your heart will be also

25649 the use of force plays a role yet military efforts to capture or kill terrorists are likely to be subordinate to measures to promote local participation in government and economic programs to spur development as well as efforts to understand and address the grievances that often lie at the heart of insurgencies
25650 for these reasons arguably the most important military component of the struggle against violent extremists is not the fighting we do ourselves but how well we help prepare our partners to defend and govern themselves

25656 since we go by boat we are not going through the territory of any other country just international waters according to israel gaza is no longer occupied so there shouldnt be a problem
25657 we are not seeking confrontation the best thing that could happen is they agree there is no reason to stop us we are perfectly harmless and if there is any conflict there is no reason for them to harm us either
25658 there is no siege there is a terrorist organisation hamas that took over gaza in a coup detat hamas is the source of all the problems in gaza israel is the only country that provides goods and fuels

25660 we asked our colleagues in israel to observe international law and end their building in the occupied territories to the great suffering of the palestinians
25661 a reluctance of the international assembly in this matter similar to the reluctance of african nations to censure mugabe

25672 researchers concluded that the ban will reduce traffic deaths by about 300 a year but only in adverse conditions such as on wet or icy roads
25673 the results published in july 2005 suggest that banning hand held phone use will not necessarily improve safety if drivers simply switch to hand free phones the study found that injury crash risk didnt vary with type of phone
25674 the most common distraction is the use of cellphones followed by drowsiness
25675 cellphone use is far less likely to be the cause of a crash or near miss than other distractions according to the study for example while reaching for a moving object such as a falling cup increased the risk of a crash or near crash by nine times talking or listening on a hand held cellphone only increased the risk by 1 3 times
25676 these findings confirm an august 2003 report from the aaa foundation for traffic safety that concluded that drivers are far less distracted by their cellphones than by other common activities such as reaching for items on the seat or glove compartment or talking to passengers

25705 el principio de estado democr tico implica un nfasis en la democracia entendida sta como el gobierno del pueblo donde la titularidad del poder pol tico descansa en el gobernado es decir en el pueblo y no en el gobernante

25727 ultimately our goal here is to be more relevant to direct marketers and their peers everyday
25728 we believe that when it comes to budget policy we have done the right thing it is the right course of action
25729 and as i said a 22 billion surplus is the best way you can position this economy going forward it gives you a buffer for the future
25730 the big challenge is as you know getting the balance right between not having an economy which is plagued by high levels of inflation forcing interest rates up over the long term while at the same time ensuring enough activity continues to be generated in the economy
25731 we have got our fiscal settings as right as we can but it is going to be tough tough in the sense of the impact on peoples family budgets
25732 look at the overall profitability levels of our banks they are huge therefore i believe they have got a responsibility to pass on
25733 we have had inflation running at 16 year highs as of when we came into office that then flows into interest rates and we have had 12 of those on the trot going up
25734 that then affects the level of activity in the economy and that in turn affects ultimately employment but when it comes to the statistics provided by the abs australian bureau of statistics it is not appropriate for politicians or prime ministers to speculate on future data
25735 the bottom line is we have an impact on the global economy flowing through to australia from the credit crisis coming out of the us sub prime
25736 we have had the further shock to the economy coming off the back of the global oil shock the biggest that weve seen since the 1970s
25737 the key challenge is that we have a course a pathway through this and thats got to be built on a strong approach to budget policy and a strong approach to long term economic reform so that we can come through this in better shape
25738 if you start to have governments preaching to the reserve bank about particular levels of monetary policy at particular times it is not a good recipe for the long term future because then you have the monetary authorities subject to day to day political pressure
25739 we believe that when it comes to budget policy we have done the right thing it is the right course of action

25813 had not been taken from a legitimate sovereign the fourth geneva convention and the hague regulations 1889 1907 were inapplicable there
25814 the convention applies only to acts by one signatory carried out on the territory of another the west bank is not the territory of a signatory power but an unallocated part of the british mandate the controversy about jewish settlements in the west bank is not therefore about legal rights but about the political will to override legal rights

25833 we are taking these steps because we want to reinforce the tremendous importance of workouts and reward their use
25834 giving our servicers more time and greater compensation to help troubled borrowers is fundamental to preserving homeownership and maximizing our efforts to minimize foreclosures

25856 their purpose in iraq is increasingly changing from fighting a war to keeping a peace

25858 dealing with holdouts rather than trying to break the back of an ongoing insurgency
25859 we received far fewer bodies because of the improved security situation the current rate is close to any normal country
25860 i am optimistic that the worst has passed and we will not see many bodies in the city anymore the iraqi people are no longer interested in continuing the cycle of violence
25861 the number of bodies has declined but i think this is a temporary calm because there are sleeper cells ready to resume their killings anytime
25862 also there are militiamen who have fled the country and might return as soon as possible
25863 must show repentance and regret before we can share communion with them
25864 even the pope is elected by his peers but what anglicans have is a man appointed by a secular government

25866 the spiritual leadership of a global communion of independent and autonomous provinces should not be reduced to one man appointed by a secular government

25868 for too many years libya has refused to accept responsibility for its horrific acts of terrorism against american victims

25878 we are pleased to report solid core financial results for the quarter and fiscal year given a challenging operating environment and competitive pressures economic conditions have resulted in weakened loan demand however our asset quality remains solid as evidenced by a non performing loans to total loans ratio of 0 11 at june 30 2008 compared to 0 09 and 0 13 for the previous two fiscal years we continue to focus on improving our core earnings while maintaining sound asset quality
25879 thats what we pay in toronto well just slip off the path and find our own
25880 its interesting because i think what we accomplished the most at the trade deadline is beginning trade discussions for the offseason there are some clubs in the pennant race that we had good discussions with but at the end they couldnt make moves because to trade those players would affect their season this year and they have more interest in continuing the discussions in october we came a long way in those discussions we feel that we have a couple of things going for october that were already planning on discussing

25882 the revised regulations simplify how franchisers report franchise turnover transfers and terminations for the past three years which again should make a potentially troubled franchiser easier to spot
25883 under the old rule it was fairly easy to disguise store failure from a new franchisee coming in
25884 like the 30 year old rules they update the revisions deal only with presale matters not issues that might arise after a franchisee has signed up
25885 it will be dedicated to educating young people on the value and the importance of public service

25917 our drivers are trained to provide the safest travel for all our passengers and every time an incident occurs they know to pull the bus over and call 911
25918 were never closed to looking at how canadians can be more safe and more secure

25921 when we saw the head we knew he was dead
25922 i dont think the guy knew him at all i think he was really crazy the poor guy he didnt see it coming
25923 i felt bad that all the young people and old people had to see that
25924 the first thing i heard was something like a terrible type of yowl and that was from the guy who got stabbed
25925 my daughter said oh my god and everybody else started screaming
25926 we are going to do whatever we need to provide the passengers with counselling or any other measures to make sure theyre taken care of

26570 overall inflation remains robust even though a price increase in utilities accounted for almost half of the total monthly increase
26571 if this is the case the peak in yearly inflation that looks to have formed should be confirmed
26572 the monetary policy deliberations from the rba board next tuesday will be a tug of war between these recessionary indicators and the still high rate of inflation as shown in the inflation gauge for july
26573 i remain of the view that this demand component is unlikely to be removed without further tightening of monetary policy

26584 i find a certain music in conservative writing that i never find in that of liberals michael oakeshott speaks of affection attachment familiarity happiness and my point is not the inane one that these are very nice things but that oakeshott thinks of them as considerations pertinent to political thinking he knows what normal life is what normal activities are and his first thought is that politics should not disturb them
26585 the one thing arguably the only thing the mccain candidacy has going for it is a sense among voters that they dont know what barack obama stands for or believes why then would mr mccain give voters reason to wonder the same thing about himself youre supposed to sow doubt about the other guy not do it to yourself

26596 i think that when the course is set up like this you have a chance to recover and hit shots and be creative and that gives the top players an opportunity to showcase their talents i feel
26597 were slowly getting my swing to where we want it to be just a matter of getting out there and playing
26598 everything is starting to fall together my putting is a little bit better i think as well
26599 if i can get that putter going and keep hitting good shots ill be ok
26600 you know this golf course is going to give you some and going to take a lot away
26601 just keep shooting in the 60s this week and i think well go close
26602 last time when i played over here it was hartford where he finished fifth and we had that great weather at the british

26604 i went back to the belly putter and felt a lot more comfortable so now im just going to focus on that more than anything else
26605 ive been changing putters back and forth and really not getting any consistency out of it

26610 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
26611 would rather lose a war than lose a political campaign
26612 we wanted to show that obama is vacuous the way these celebrities are
26613 we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
26614 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
26615 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong

26626 the proposed sale of the kosher gym has spawned rumors misinformation and allegations
26627 consumers have a right to air their grievances on blogs in forums etc kosher gyms clientele should feel they have someone to turn to who will be proactive in examining the purported deficiencies in service oriented goals
26628 i have therefore set up a kosher gym consumer helpline to explore and address client complaints we are urging those who have encountered difficulties with kosher gym practices to contact our office via email at hikindd assembly state ny us or to call my office 718 853 9616 we intend to evaluate complaints and thoroughly survey the issues involved to protect the consumer
26629 portray barack obama as unpatriotic john mccain and his surrogates are accusing him in a tv commercial and elsewhere of canceling a visit to wounded troops at the landstuhl regional medical center a military hospital in germany because he was not allowed to take reporters and camera crews with him
26630 although news outlets have reported charges that sen barack obama canceled his trip to landstuhl regional medical center in germany because the media werent allowed to cover the event u s european command officials say plans were in place to allow limited press coverage

26636 we have campaigned hard for every vote in every corner of the state and were going to finish this race working for the support of everyday missourians in small towns and big cities alike
26637 missourians want an attorney general who will be their voice and who they can count on to stand up to the special interests this tour is one more example we can offer the voters of just how hard i am willing to fight for them
26638 telstra like a number of other major australian companies is affected by changes to superannuation laws made by the previous government we must of course comply with the law
26639 the take home pay of the majority of our employees is unaffected by this legislative change
26640 this is no surprise to our staff affected employees were informed of this before these changes occurred
26641 he just loved living life and having a good time
26642 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
26643 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
26644 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
26645 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
26646 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
26647 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
26648 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
26649 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
26650 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
26651 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
26652 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
26653 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
26654 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
26655 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
26656 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
26657 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
26658 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
26659 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
26660 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
26661 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
26662 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
26663 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
26664 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
26665 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
26666 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
26667 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
26668 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
26669 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
26670 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
26671 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
26672 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
26673 this years crop of peanuts has been in the ground for weeks and 2008 production contracts were signed months ago changing the loan differential formula after the peanut crop has been planted would have been detrimental for our growers domestic demand for peanuts and peanut products has increased and the federal government should allow growers to respond to this demand without interrupting current systems in place i applaud usda for recognizing the importance of maintaining the historically recognized practice of establishing loan differentials for the 2008 crop year
26674 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
26675 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
26676 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
26677 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
26678 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
26679 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
26680 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
26681 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
26682 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
26683 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
26684 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
26685 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
26686 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
26687 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
26688 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
26689 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
26690 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
26691 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
26692 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
26693 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
26694 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
26695 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
26696 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
26697 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
26698 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
26699 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
26700 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
26701 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
26702 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
26703 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
26704 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
26705 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
26706 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
26707 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
26708 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
26709 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
26710 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
26711 who are open to doing something on the production side
26712 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
26713 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
26714 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
26715 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
26716 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
26717 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
26718 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
26719 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
26720 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
26721 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
26722 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
26723 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
26724 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
26725 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
26726 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
26727 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
26728 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
26729 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
26730 you could start to play on monday nights and look at other various things to squeeze it in but then theres issues like the surface and so forth
26731 improbable looking rock formations thin and spindly life forms and flying as a common form of locomotion
26732 no central authority exists rival governments compete for control law level refers to the government nearest the starport
26733 following tuesdays earthquake rick hoffman who heads coldwell bankers residential brokerage for greater san diego and the desert region joked
26734 a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
26735 race will not have any role in my campaign nor is there any place for it im disappointed that hes used it
26736 run negative ads on me continuously and i might point out for the record that his was the first
26737 youd think wed be having a serious debate but so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton and britney spears i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can come up with
26738 our politics is small when we need to be thinking big
26739 i admire his obamas campaign but what we are talking about here is substance and not style and what were talking about is who has an agenda for the future of america campaigns are tough but i am proud of the campaign that we have run
26740 yesterday he suggested that we put air in our tires to save on gas my friends lets do that but do you think thats enough to break our dependence on middle eastern oil i dont think so
26741 the mccain campaign has very clearly decided that the only way to win this election is to become very personal and very negative we believe that people will see that as nothing more than the same old politics and the same old policies of the last eight years
26742 mr fukuda said that he wants to reshuffle his cabinet today
26743 the prime minister asked us for our cooperation in the reshuffle
26744 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
26745 theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
26746 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name
26747 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies
26748 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
26749 we think the tenor of his campaign is unlikely to change that is what he is offering voters increasingly harsh character attacks personal attacks while people are out there struggling every day
26750 if you came out here with us youd see that we have supportive crowds who really ask us about the issues
26751 i think tasmania could play an integral role in our national competition and theyve got a rich history of people they are very decent people they have served us very well with their relationship with hawthorn theyve invested very heavily in york park
26752 announcements like that last night make it very real and theres a lot of good will obviously
26753 eso no es un problema especial el problema es que por las dificultades organizativas se nos est n presentando inconvenientes lo que necesitamos es entrenarnos y entrenarnos bien
26754 its a bad thing because it says that in our country if you are an extremely wealthy person you can run for office and get elected
26755 what does it say to the common man who this country was founded on about their ability to get elected to office
26756 en segunda se encontrar defensas muy duras aqu en espa a tampoco se regala nada

26826 mr fukuda said that he wants to reshuffle his cabinet today
26827 the prime minister asked us for our cooperation in the reshuffle
26828 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
26829 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
26830 to make things even trickier if the police come to your door to ask you about a crime in the neighborhood and you immediately
26831 would a typical police officer willingly abuse his authority to intimidate and possibly injure you no
26832 actually if you try to help the police and later become a suspect according to law they cannot use anything against you that you say before they give you the miranda warning
26833 would a typical police officer willingly abuse his authority to intimidate and possibly injure you no
26834 you do not have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court
26835 police should not be trusted because they are told at the highest levels to do whatever it takes
26836 it isnt possible for anything you to say to help you
26837 no i never confessed to that in fact i refused to talk to them at all
26838 michael ash is helping the police realise they have to reform
26839 what would you have the detective do shrug and let everyone go or break the deadlock by throwing dice and randomly promise one of the suspects immunity thus risking that the villain once identified cannot be convicted
26840 youre underestimating how strong my interest is in living under the rule of law where there is a fighting chance that criminals will get caught
26841 baleiloa is still on life support but slowly improving moving and opening his eyes
26842 this is an old charge that karadzic started in 1996
26843 such a deal would have been immoral and unethical it obviously didnt happen
26844 ambassador holbrooke and we have repeatedly made clear that no agreement was ever made in which radovan karadzic was provided immunity from prosecution or arrest
26845 and in order to explain this to his own people he put the story out then and he has embroidered it over 12 years but there is zero truth to it i have testified to that account
26846 if holbrooke still wants my death and regrets there is no death sentence at this court i want to know if his arm is long enough to reach me here
26847 what i said was that i know that the hague does not have a death penalty but if anybody deserves the death penalty its radovan karadzic because he was responsible directly or indirectly for 300 000 deaths
26848 its a little bit like a free lunch without the calories
26849 i see the temperature between india and pakistan intensifying rather than cooling
26850 india is the biggest market in saarc but they have been slow to allow competition to come in india has instead struck trade deals with individual member countries like sri lanka nepal and bangladesh
26851 i cant see things moving forward in the free trade area in the near future
26852 everybody prefers bilateral deals because its easier to agree on what can be imported and exported
26853 it took the european union 50 years to get the euro out were still just 23 years old well try to get there to lower trade barriers and forge a currency union much faster
26854 die gegend ist eine kriegszone wir verlangen dort eine waffenruhe damit wir sie freilassen k nnen
26855 seien auf einem berg der region freigelassen worden und dort etwa eine halbe stunde sp ter von sicherheitskr ften gefunden worden
26856 the spiritual leadership of a global communion of independent and autonomous provinces should not be reduced to one man appointed by a secular government
26857 even the pope is elected by his peers but what the anglicans have is a man appointed by a secular government over the past five years we have come to see this as a remnant of british colonialism and it is not serving us well
26858 the ordination of women to the episcopate blocks substantially and finally a possible recognition of anglican orders by the catholic church
26859 we hope for the continuation of a theological dialogue between the anglican communion and the catholic church but the latter development directly undermines our goal and alters the level of what we pursue in dialogue
26860 it was a good day you cant be displeased with a 65 on this course or any course
26861 i hate to say it i think i could have shot a 61 or 62 today
26862 i mean his was the open championship mine was the senior open championship but still when you have it in your grasp like that you have something a little bit in common
26863 so it was a nice walk on tuesday with these guys and i got up and struck the ball nicely i said ok new week lets just go at it again
26864 i played well i just couldnt get it over the hump
26865 some were very mushy very soft they put a lot of moisture in some greens and not in others
26866 it was tough judging especially the second shot not knowing what the golf ball was going to do it got into a bit of a guessing game at the end of the day
26867 its such a mental brain drain by the time you do your calculations and try to figure out whether its 20 percent or 30 percent or 18 percent
26868 by the time you do the math in your head then you have to figure out what shot you want to hit
26869 our markets are very challenging this year with lower seedling orders resulting from the current downturn in the forest industry
26870 our customers are dealing with the combined effects of the sharp downturn in us housing starts low lumber prices and higher canadian dollar and the resulting reduction in timber harvesting has impacted our industry
26871 no more messages to the palestinian authority so that it will act
26872 made clear that what mofaz said was not to be understood as an order and should not be treated as a directive for action
26873 they are not there to be fondled kissed or felt they are there to be admired discussed lusted after and photographed the moment they are touched and i mean in the heat of passion rather than out of curiosity or in the interests of scientific research then the spell is broken and this is true of all fake breasts no matter how much money has been spent on this act of female self mutilation
26874 hardbody blonde trophy girlfriends in the eighties was a fiction and remains so
26875 why arent there armies of thinking women protesting about the grotesquely booming trade in bogus breasts
26876 breast surgery has become just another part of the beauty regime like applying make up and its unnecessary and unpleasant
26877 its treated the same as getting a haircut its become normalised i think any woman considering breast surgery for cosmetic reasons should spend a month in darfur and then decide if body image is a really important issue
26878 fake breasts have become inescapable but i think the main reason why women do it is to please men theyre trying to fulfil a male fantasy and i dont think we can blame them for this it might make them feel more confident but it is ultimately for men
26879 fake breasts simply look false they lack any kind of beauty or the softness associated with real breasts implants look like two oranges stuffed in your top theyre nothing like real breasts
26880 three were cosmetic and two were reconstructive one of the cosmetic operations went wrong and the implant leaked so she had to have two reconstructive operations after that
26881 a lot of them were very scarred from all the surgery
26882 there was one lady in particular whose boobs didnt even look like boobs any more
26883 very few of my patients are the glamour model types we see in the media
26884 i tell them to go to somebody else if they say they want to be like jordan
26885 big implants cause drooping over time they stretch the skin and squash the breast tissue women whove had them will definitely need more operations over time which will in turn cause more scarring
26886 freddie bowled a fantastic spell and brought england back into the game
26887 there is a little bit in that wicket and he put it in the right areas to make life tough
26888 any time you get good battles in test cricket it is great people are saying with twenty20 around that test cricket is going to die but i dont think it is people still want to come to watch it and to get exciting afternoons like that what more do you want
26889 it was just a mindless rant emotions were running a bit high ive been in to apologise and were friends again
26890 we have completed restoring mail service including historical messages to all of the 1 of affected members
26891 thank you all for your extreme patience during this trying time
26892 so the status page says service has been restored and if you are still having problems get help via chat
26893 i sign into chat i get a computer pretending to be chris and another computer pretending to be jamal both tell me that i am not having problems and kick me out of chat
26894 i tried to contact them five times and got booted off saying i wasnt affected wasnt affected then where are my e mails
26895 my problems followed the exact pattern of the mail outage but even after explaining this was booted out of the chat
26896 john im sorry according to our records you were not one of the members affected by the email outage that began on july 18th mobileme mail 24 hour chat support is a temporary measure designed specifically for users whose accounts were affected by that outage
26897 by completing this restoration of mail services we hope we have put the vast majority of mobileme mail problems behind us and can now focus on improving other aspects of this new ambitious service

26908 considering how it could have been it is relatively minor injuries lots of walking wounded
26909 everyone involved has been incredibly lucky if it hadnt been for the soft landing on the verge i think the injuries would have been a lot more serious
26910 if the bus had rolled on to the roadside rather than on to gorse it could have been more serious the driver did his best to get the casualties out of the bus so they were very lucky
26911 it is regrettable we have had to take the difficult decision to restructure our glasgow office but falling demand for passports means ips must make decisions to maintain our high standards across the business
26912 customers will still receive the same first rate service when applying for passports and glasgows public counter will remain open to provide assistance including issuing urgent and emergency passports
26913 i am very disappointed and fear this is the nail in the coffin for the future of passport services in scotland
26914 this is a very serious situation with nearly 50 per cent of the posts going it is a huge blow
26915 when the government is attempting to talk up its border security credentials it is nonsensical for them to be making swingeing cuts to the last remaining passport office in scotland
26916 the passport office is a vital public service and people across glasgow will be affected by the decision to axe over 100 staff
26917 like a parody of jewish survival olmert has persisted indestructible
26918 it can force people to follow you which means all your twits will be showed in their twitter home page including potentially malicious links
26919 technical details will be added as soon as this vulnerability will be fixed
26920 im working on several ways to abuse twitter as a platform and ill publish my research in this blog when im done
26921 i dont want to seem like a heartless creature but in all my years i never considered this could happen
26922 this is a serial killer and what kind of mercy did she show her victims when you torture someone you have no compassion how do you ask others to give it to you it is her duty in order to pay for her crimes to die in prison
26923 she has been disciplinary free for most of her incarceration
26924 of all the women currently incarcerated in california she has been in prison the longest
26925 she showed no compassion she told my sister as she slit her throat that she didnt care for her or her unborn baby
26926 i dont think that she ever really saw the real me
26927 im not in my court room and i dont have my robe so im not judging im just telling you
26928 this impressive level of continuing support for bowdoin faculty is confirmation of the importance of their work on a national and international level
26929 we are very fortunate to have faculty who are making important contributions to their fields and involving undergraduates in their research and scholarship
26930 eucalypt growth in past and future environments a novel approach to understanding the impacts of atmospheric co2 and climate
26931 this court is without authority to grant a compassionate release unless there is a positive recommendation by the secretary of the department of corrections and rehabilitation or board of parole hearings
26932 sometimes standing on rigid ceremony is a waste of everyones time and money requiring a cancer victim to die in prison on the publics dime for symbolic purposes does nothing for public safety or crime prevention and we have better things to spend the money on in these difficult times
26933 by not trying to get out every fucking chance she gets by not filing writs and appeals and shit yes she is in prison and yes it sucks and yes it is because of her notoriety but i would consider letting her out if she were contrite and bitch is so not contrite
26934 van houtens reputation as an ideal prisoner should not affect the decision of the parole board
26935 after 37 years in the slammer i think most of us would do anything at all to get out grasp any straw however flimsy or any legal recourse or loophole however tenuous something to do with the survival instinct
26936 i am sure that yahoo management will take a verbal beating
26937 i just dont think that the annual meeting is where the debate over yahoo strategy is going to take place
26938 no matter how strongly a large number of shareholders feel about the boards previous actions
26939 demand for fuel efficient vehicles is so strong that the customer is willing to buy used ones at a significant premium
26940 at the end of the month i wont have a prius on the ground
26941 they will probably sell for the price of a new one
26942 i hate to say it i think i could have shot a 61 or 62 today
26943 i mean his was the open championship mine was the senior open championship but still when you have it in your grasp like that you have something a little bit in common

26950 i think some studios go to something like comic con mainly because theyre afraid that if they dont go and their movies dont work someone above them will say why didnt you go to comic con
26951 says one producer whos had movies with large fan campaigns
26952 our marketing strategy with fall release choke is to get all the chuck palahniuk fans in
26953 the problem is theres no real way to measure how big that base is
26954 sometimes that small group can be loyally fanatical and will never grow to the point of critical mass
26955 there are some shows youre never going to find profitability with no matter how much a fan base loves it
26956 the total number of people in the blog world is probably only a few hundred thousand and as much as they might hate to hear it for most movies thats not going to make the difference between a success and a failure
26957 you sit there and think six thousand people are cheering for us we must be doing something right
26958 i think some studios go to something like comic con mainly because theyre afraid that if they dont go and their movies dont work someone above them will say why didnt you go to comic con
26959 says one producer whos had movies with large fan campaigns

26975 the cumulative results show that oberweis plain and simple is not liked
26976 what has to happen before he understands this someone to drive a political stake through his heart
26977 its too early to say that this race is in the bag for foster but it is very rare that a candidate wins a special and then loses next time around
26978 he just has this confidence that i dont know where it comes from or how he maintains it goes beyond confidence just outright knowledge that he can make a difference
26979 i get to meet ethan canin i get to meet ethan canin
26980 im jodi and you sent me an e mail that made my summer
26981 this is the first mistake ive made on this book tour
26982 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
26983 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
26984 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
26985 but he has no plausible way to achieve it his budget would actually move things in the opposite direction away from balance
26986 government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem
26987 the american society of civil engineers estimates that were going to have to spend 1 6 trillion over the next five years to rebuild our infrastructure
26988 weve let things lapse for 20 years the pipes wires asphalt bridges and radar systems are old and everything seems to be falling apart at once
26989 he hasnt talked very much about his vision for modernizing american infrastructure
26990 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
26991 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
26992 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
26993 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
26994 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom
26995 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
26996 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
26997 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
26998 put more simply usage of 64 bit windows vista is growing much more rapidly than 32 bit
26999 based on current trends this growth will accelerate as the retail channel shifts to supplying a rapidly increasing assortment of 64 bit desktops and laptops
27000 if you start from almost zero its easy to triple
27001 two things have to happen people have to begin deploying vista in a broad way and have to believe that all of their applications are fully compatible with a 64 bit environment
27002 its nice to see 64 bit use tracking this way
27003 but im not going home to the wife and saying its finally the time i have to go out and buy a 64 bit windows pc i just dont think people are excited by this kind of thing the way they used to be
27004 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
27005 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
27006 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
27007 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
27008 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
27009 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
27010 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
27011 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
27012 thats a no brainer of course its a violation of international law thats why its a covert action the guy is a terrorist go grab his ass
27013 the music industry is a business like any other but at the helm of this industry is a pool of artists whose work often serves as a barometer to the social and environmental challenges our society faces
27014 its a bit patronizing for us 21 year olds to try to start to change the world
27015 especially when were using enough power for 10 houses just for stage lighting itd be a bit hypocritical
27016 ill be the first to admit that the music industry has some big unavoidable emissions associated with their business
27017 with upward of 60 vehicles getting seven miles per gallon for a single national tour the impact can be pretty staggering
27018 a majority of pollution and waste associated with music tours is actually an effect of the fans themselves driving to and from shows producing waste at the shows littering in parking lots and venues using one use plastic containers for all their food and drink etc
27019 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
27020 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
27021 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
27022 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
27023 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
27024 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
27025 you know life shouldnt be hard its all about connecting and finding a reason for it
27026 how many times has she gotten me involved in things even when ive said no im not doing it
27027 its just something about jaki she has a way of talking people into doing things without them even realizing it
27028 you cant help but get sucked in shes so approachable
27029 my business is my life and im ok with that
27030 i think she would love to have a significant other an equal whos really the key person in her life
27031 she needs someone to share it with because shes accumulated so much and i dont just mean wealth
27032 in 10 to 12 years we will reach the tipping point
27033 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
27034 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
27035 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
27036 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
27037 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
27038 i am in keeping with the vision of one ronald reagan
27039 theres a lot of us voting against obama more than anything else
27040 over the years there are a lot of issues ive disagreed with you about and i would like to know how do you assure me and other conservatives that you will hold to our values and give me something to be excited about
27041 everywhere i go i am hearing the same thing i am uneasy about obama and i think mccain is going to win
27042 it is win win all the way this fiery take no prisoners attitude is what will do it for him for the first time he is really beginning to get his moorings
27043 climate change my friend i have to tell you with all due respect is real its real and the question is how do we address it
27044 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
27045 unlike barack obama john mccains words are backed up by his votes and his many conservative achievements and conservatives take great comfort in his remarkable record
27046 that was just resting there as a negative issue but the approach he is taking is making it a positive
27047 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
27048 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
27049 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
27050 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
27051 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
27052 integrated into a mainstream investment process in a way that enhances profitability
27053 an inconvenient truth the planetary emergency of global warming and what we can do about it
27054 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
27055 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
27056 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
27057 hes the only naked man that will ever be in my bedroom
27058 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
27059 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
27060 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
27061 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
27062 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
27063 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
27064 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
27065 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
27066 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
27067 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
27068 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
27069 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
27070 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
27071 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
27072 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
27073 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
27074 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
27075 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
27076 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
27077 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
27078 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
27079 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
27080 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
27081 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
27082 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
27083 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
27084 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
27085 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
27086 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
27087 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
27088 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
27089 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
27090 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
27091 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
27092 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
27093 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
27094 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
27095 there is not much that evangelicals have in common with the policies promoted by barack obama
27096 despite his best efforts to court people of faith voters understand the difference between lip service and public service and john mccains record is much more in line with the values of the evangelical community
27097 one thing that it clearly is indicative of this poll is that this nation cares about the christian values and ethics of a candidate for national office and it makes enough difference that the news media reports on it
27098 people of faith have always been involved in the political process they have a patriotic and scriptural obligation to do so it is to be ignored at the candidates peril
27099 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
27100 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
27101 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
27102 if only al gore had stopped with the invention of the internet instead of going on to invent global warming
27103 it represents a challenge to all americans in every walk of life
27104 the survival of the united states of america as we know it
27105 the tendency to offer old solutions to each crisis separately without taking the others into account
27106 when we look at all three of these seemingly intractable challenges at the same time we can see the common thread running through them our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three
27107 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures that are needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
27108 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year
27109 and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
27110 the quickest cheapest most efficient and best way to start using all of this renewable energy is in the production of electricity
27111 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
27112 it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
27113 get us off oil make us energy independent invest in clean energy and create a new generation of high quality green collar jobs
27114 one more rustbowl outpost that crawled out of the wrong side of the 1980s
27115 our families cant stand 10 more years of gasoline price increases
27116 im convinced that the marketing and pr experts surrounding the obamas clued in to the enormous influence that celebrities have had on the american public particularly women over the past seven years since the emergence of us weekly star and other celebrity newsweeklies and the subsequent explosion of celebrity news and they want to take advantage of the deep affection that americans have developed for celebrities
27117 more than most presidential candidates the obamas have to introduce themselves and make sure the american public is comfortable with them they havent been on the national stage that long
27118 and they need to go in short lead publications like people and us weekly they cant wait another month or two for monthly magazine interviews they want the american public to understand who they are and who they are as a family immediately
27119 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
27120 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
27121 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
27122 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does
27123 i hope the eagles now can win it the sixers mo cheeks and those guys can win it
27124 its amazing how many people have texted or e mailed or called
27125 coach tom coughlin from the giants andy reid bill belichick bob kraft doug flutie john elway al gore youd be surprised at the people who were glued to their tv sunday charlie weis
27126 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
27127 today i challenge our nation to commit itself to becoming 100 apple users within the next ten years
27128 ask not what ford can do for you ask what gm product you can buy
27129 esto un derecho a r plica nos demuestra que estamos en vivo
27130 gore s talking about electricity generation and what hes really substituting out is one of our most abundant resources that makes us energy independent and thats coal
27131 and if oil can be obtained from our own domestic locations either the outer continental shelf or anwr or oil shale in utah and the rockies and it can be done without environmental harm now not 100 percent guarantee of no environmental harm but reasonable kinds of risks of environmental harms that would not be catastrophic then why wouldnt we why wouldnt we do that
27132 we need to explore all avenues that we can for energy many factors should be taken into consideration it has to be safe cost effective and timely we cannot be limited in our thinking
27133 did democrat mary landrieu not read the gore memo she now 21 years later for the purposes of reelection wants drilling in the gulf she and democrats have oppposed it for 21 years vote em out and join drill now drill here polar bears eat the baby seals democrats protect how stupid of democrats to save everything and lose their own souls respectfully john mcintyre
27134 how soon we forget old gore has lost it take a look at his scare brain ideas he tried to legislate when vp population control acid rain etc and now his global warming placing the blame on we the people have you read the scientific reports who disagree its costing us billions amp we the people are paying for his errors
27135 i think coal is a very good partial solution to our energy needs there is coal for hundreds of years there is also a system close to final stages of development that will use electron technology to remove toxic pollutants so2 and nox as well as particulants this system is near production just a couple of miles from congress at escrub in alexandria va add this to wind solar hydrogen nuclear and domestic oil and we would have a smooth steady and possible transition to the future sources that are not available now
27136 how thankful i am that god did not allow gore to be elected to an office
27137 dr chiltons ideas are practical and need to be implemented without further delay
27138 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
27139 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
27140 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
27141 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
27142 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
27143 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
27144 climate change is the greatest environmental crisis that humanity has ever faced but it is not the only serious challenge confronting us there is a simultaneous source problem known as peak oil arising from the depletion of the fuels we are burning particularly petroleum the solution to both climate change and peak oil is to develop renewable sources of energy to use less energy to use energy differently and to make this shift as rapidly as possible
27145 al gores ambitious goal provides a national focus and call to action now whats needed is a clear sighted plan for achieving it one that recognizes the complex issues of energy depletion the vulnerability of the supply chain and the limits of technology we are taking up gores call and presenting a powerful framework to realize this vision a vision that would revitalize america and make it genuinely sustainable
27146 al gores generational challenge to repower america which places energy at the forefront of the national agenda should be the top issue debated by all candidates this fall
27147 energy touches almost every critical issue facing our country including the economy security and the environment gores courageous and rational plan to move to 100 renewable energy sources in 10 years has my full support our 10 point plan provides the stepping stones to achieve this target
27148 we thank al gore for articulating the most urgent action needed to safeguard americas environmental economic and societal future and that of the entire world our mission is to get society off of fossil fuels fast and we embrace the need to move to 100 renewable energy with this plan
27149 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
27150 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
27151 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
27152 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
27153 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
27154 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
27155 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
27156 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
27157 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
27158 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
27159 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
27160 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
27161 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
27162 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
27163 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
27164 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
27165 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
27166 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
27167 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
27168 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
27169 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
27170 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
27171 demands coincided with the democrats highly publicized trip to iraq
27172 bush administration is preparing to join multilateral talks with iran on nuclear policy
27173 the central front in the war on terror is not iraq and it never was
27174 the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
27175 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
27176 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
27177 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
27178 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
27179 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
27180 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
27181 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
27182 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
27183 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
27184 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
27185 we should tax what we burn not what we earn
27186 meanwhile the war in iraq continues and now the war in afghanistan appears to be getting worse
27187 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
27188 of course there are those who will tell us that this cant be done
27189 but even those who reap the profits of the carbon age have to recognize the inevitability of its demise
27190 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
27191 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
27192 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
27193 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
27194 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
27195 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
27196 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
27197 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
27198 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
27199 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
27200 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
27201 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
27202 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
27203 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
27204 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
27205 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
27206 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
27207 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
27208 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
27209 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
27210 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
27211 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
27212 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
27213 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
27214 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
27215 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
27216 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
27217 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
27218 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
27219 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
27220 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
27221 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
27222 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
27223 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
27224 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
27225 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
27226 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
27227 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
27228 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
27229 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
27230 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
27231 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
27232 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
27233 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
27234 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
27235 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
27236 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
27237 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
27238 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
27239 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
27240 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
27241 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
27242 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses
27243 enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
27244 if america could land a man on the moon in 10 years why cant it
27245 the apollo program cost 25 4 billion about 150 billion in current dollars to land just 12 astronauts on the moon
27246 the interstate highway system was originally estimated to take 12 years and cost 25 billion to construct
27247 it actually took 35 years and cost 114 billion over 800 billion in current dollars
27248 fastracks is an overly ambitious bloated proposal that would raise the sales tax in many metro communities to near the limits of voter tolerance
27249 from each according to ability to each according to need
27250 capitalism works for the benefit of the smart hardworking and strong those are exactly the efforts that the left want to discourage
27251 if we can socalize a program and put a man on the moon why can t we
27252 from each according to their ability to each according to their need
27253 panic and fear co2 and demagoguery the sky is falling its too hot its too rainy really big hurricanes and more storms and tornadoes and lightning america awaken cease your evil ways and lift your eyes and arms and wallets to the man from tennessee heal oh mother earth heal heal heal please write for special carbon dispensation healing credits hurry calamity is knocking at the door already
27254 just two days ago 27 senior statesmen and retired military leaders warned of the national security threat from an energy tsunami that would be triggered by a loss of our access to foreign oil and also the undeniable warming the planet is currently undergoing
27255 when we look at all three of these seemingly intractable challenges at the same time we can see the common thread running through them deeply ironic in its simplicity our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
27256 we must now lift our nation to reach another goal that will change history our entire civilization depends upon us now embarking on a new journey of exploration and discovery our success depends on our willingness as a people to undertake this journey and to complete it within 10 years once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
27257 ok no offense without putting us all to sleep how is he going to meet the 10 year challenge
27258 one thing that can begin to get us on that road to independence
27259 al gore won the energy debate over the last seven years we have no drilling and gas is 4 bucks a gallon surprise surprise what the media need to do is reconcile the fact that the american people want more energy production
27260 h e promised sharply higher energy prices for everybody in the next 10 years
27261 where does that money come from for a new president who is facing a 400 billion deficit has two wars going on needs an economic stimulus if its a democrat as obama has outlined we have a housing crisis in this country and probably diminished tax revenues
27262 there have been no major sweeping initiatives coming out of this democratic controlled congress
27263 you can put it on the agenda and try to move the country
27264 devastating effect on main street and especially on rural america
27265 do you think that right now climate change is as much a threat to our country as terror
27266 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
27267 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
27268 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
27269 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
27270 it represents a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
27271 its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
27272 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
27273 we cannot do the job with renewables and energy efficiency alone
27274 we have to have a balanced energy portfolio that includes all those things in even higher percentages but also has to include nuclear and we frankly think that nuclear should be increased
27275 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
27276 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
27277 its a very aggressive bold comprehensive proposal and its great to challenge the politicians to go where they need to go
27278 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
27279 i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president
27280 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on
27281 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
27282 former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
27283 we cannot do the job with renewables and energy efficiency alone we have to have a balanced energy portfolio that includes all those things in even higher percentages but also has to include nuclear and we frankly think that nuclear should be increased
27284 the vice presidents main effort is to mobilize the american people behind meaningful action and less talk about global warming
27285 its a very aggressive bold comprehensive proposal and its great to challenge the politicians to go where they need to go
27286 none of us can walk away from this issue without agreeing with him that we do have a very serious problem and its only going to get worse unless we do something about it i hope to be a part of that and i would like to see the free market take the lead not the government
27287 it pointed out that the only way we have a chance to drive down oil prices is if we become free of the slavery of oil if we can give americans choices of electrical cars or biodiesel cars then and only then do we have a chance of dealing with this cost issue that is why 4 a gallon gas is not an enemy of action its an ally of action
27288 lazer inoxs consistent and strong track record is a testament to the exceptional quality of management led by the companys president patrick dore the combined entity is positioned favourably to realize on significant growth opportunities across canada
27289 we are proud to add another high quality asset to our portfolio lazer inox is a well recognized and respected brand name in a highly specialized niche and we are eager to assist them in executing their growth plan
27290 you know its not about you its about your country
27291 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
27292 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
27293 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
27294 our dangerous reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all these problems economic environmental national security
27295 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
27296 even those who reap the profits of the carbon age have to recognise the inevitability of its demise
27297 the stone age didnt end because of a shortage of stones
27298 we should tax what we burn not what we earn
27299 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
27300 we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels
27301 its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
27302 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
27303 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
27304 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
27305 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
27306 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
27307 for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall shew great signs and wonders insomuch that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect
27308 its a declining revenue source as people cut down on their driving
27309 a new drug halts the devastating progress of alzheimers disease say british scientists
27310 you must have known that i had feelings deep enough to swim in
27311 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
27312 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
27313 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington
27314 there is nothing more to this than the fact that he was describing that he was new to the political scene he was referring to the fact that he didnt come into the race with the history of others it is not about race
27315 what he meant to say was only that he has no experience
27316 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
27317 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
27318 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
27319 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
27320 i know you dont want to hear it but i think the marine is really into you like i think he says what you want to hear and is hoping that youll fall for him eventually
27321 okay now dont go falling in love with me or anything because i dont want that crap im going to be really cool and make it hard for you not to develop feelings for me but dont fall in love with me okay i know its difficult just try to be strong
27322 marine i know the other day you said its cool that we have the kind of relationship that we do because it takes a lot of the pressure off but im worried that you are trying to make this more serious than i intended i have let some things get out of hand which i understand could make it hard for you not to be mislead i just want a friends with benefits sort of deal not exclusive not some big deal where we meet each others parents and talk about our future together i want to have fun and leave it at that
27323 hey marine ive got something i want to ask you um do you want chinese or greek for dinner tonight chinese great ill be back twenty minutes after never byeee
27324 its easy to turn stupid when youre having mind blowing sex right right anyone
27325 you know it could just be about the sex we have fantastic sex especially now that we figured out what condom to use its easy to turn stupid when youre having mind blowing sex right right anyone
27326 i just wanted to make sure we both understood our relationship goodnight
27327 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
27328 it was a politically motivated action to disrupt anwar s political career
27329 we should take a trip somewhere together imagine how much fun we would get into if we were both single
27330 please use public transit bicycling or other climate friendly means
27331 have to go back 15 years to find ice expansion so far south
27332 responsible individuals throughout the industrialized world are trying to come to grips with the harm being done to the global environment
27333 yeah what was that about i thought you wanted to do that with me
27334 well she backed out so we can go want to leave saturday

27340 oh my god vixs boyfriend is hot why the hell is he dating her
27341 i dont think annika could come out here and finish you know 15th or 12th on the money list and live with herself
27342 eight pounds and five ounces doesnt sound necessarily big but it felt big
27343 a bit stuck to be perfectly honest they dont want to move
27344 i dont think we can have changes until we can free your hips up to let them move
27345 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
27346 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
27347 the guy looks like he knows how to eat pussy
27348 sweetie hes not into you he called you by the wrong name for fuckssake
27349 im prettier than that bitch on your arm is xoxo
27350 hi and please remember to pick up the dry cleaning this time sweetie
27351 hi i miss you i love you i hate it when you go weeks without returning my messages but dont worry im not going anywhere
27352 this would be even better if another guy were here make that two other guys
27353 when we make love in my imagination it is so breath taking that i cry
27354 happy anniversary weve known each other for 1 year 3 months 3 weeks and 6 days and i hope today is the day you return my undying love for you
27355 i know what will help cure that sore throat baby
27356 please note that i just sat down and made this up
27357 love possesses not nor would it be possessed for love is sufficient unto love
27358 him at some point likely not too much afterward you will discover he is not
27359 i could have met you in a sandbox i could have passed you on the sidewalk
27360 having his first real vacation in years and with a cute girl who puts out
27361 so are you still cool with how things are going between us
27362 yeah its cool i like being able to enjoy things without worrying about stuff like i usually do with a girl its nice the way it is i like it
27363 i dont wanna go back to work i want to lie around and be naked i did not think this through damnit
27364 would you call the client and ask him yada yada
27365 tis better to be fucked at lunch than not to be fucked at all
27366 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
27367 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
27368 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
27369 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
27370 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
27371 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
27372 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
27373 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
27374 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
27375 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
27376 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
27377 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
27378 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
27379 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
27380 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
27381 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
27382 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
27383 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
27384 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
27385 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
27386 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
27387 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
27388 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
27389 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
27390 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
27391 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
27392 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
27393 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
27394 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
27395 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
27396 if you ever get me pregnant i will smack the crap out of you
27397 but how do you know when its worth the risk
27398 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
27399 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
27400 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
27401 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
27402 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
27403 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
27404 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
27405 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
27406 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
27407 the regional fugitive task force is a program that works with local law enforcement to take the worst of the worst criminal offenders off the street florida is experiencing an increase in violent crime and this program is a priority
27408 this additional 10 million will help to expand the task forces presence in florida
27409 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
27410 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
27411 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
27412 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
27413 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
27414 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
27415 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
27416 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
27417 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
27418 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
27419 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
27420 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
27421 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
27422 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
27423 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
27424 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
27425 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
27426 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
27427 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
27428 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
27429 what shawna lindy did after the crash was directly contrary to the core basic human values that we are based upon
27430 on the one inclination you have a fine young man who died just as he was starting out his adult life and died tragically so as a judge i say what if he were my son if i did it emotionally id probably want her to serve forever
27431 but if im going to do that then i say what if shes my daughter what do i want in that case so there is a balancing its not just simply saying im going to decide one way or the other i have to do both
27432 parents family and friends an ongoing nightmare i am sick and tired of the daily reminder of this torment and loss
27433 still has problems there are days we dont talk about joshua
27434 our hearts yearn to have him with us and i would do anything to just have him smile again
27435 there is nothing that can be said that will bring joshua back or erase the tragic scene that is now forever implanted in zacharys memory
27436 he taught me to dribble a basketball without looking down
27437 i know that if he could he would be there for me i also have faith that he was there in spirit but thats not the same as being there in real life cheering me on
27438 a young mans head was smashed into her windshield and a man was on her hood for 149 feet
27439 she didnt stop because she feared the consequences to herself
27440 anybody would know to stop and find out if there is anything that could be done
27441 theres a legal and moral duty that we are talking about even if there was a dog that was struck or a deer that was struck
27442 she had to know it was a person and she would not extend the same courtesy that the normal person would for an animal lying in the road
27443 she knew what she had hit and that it was a person and thats exactly why she didnt stop
27444 she knew she was on probation in gloucester for two drug charges
27445 shes morally depleted of basic human values and the commonwealth is concerned what she will be like when she is released
27446 i dont know what sentence beyond incarceration will do because shes shown what shed be like outside of jail
27447 struck on the roadway as there was no indication of the vehicle traveling into the grass
27448 there is nothing we can do to change that night there is nothing we can do to bring this young man back
27449 we could give her a life sentence if the court had the authority to do that but it wouldnt change the circumstances that were enunciated from the witness stand by the halstead family
27450 medicare fraud wastes taxpayer dollars hurts legitimate businesses and shrinks the important resources that should be going to care for our seniors and disabled
27451 our bill will give cms and hhs the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred from pay and chase to detect and prevent
27452 each year roughly 30 to 60 billion a year in taxpayer dollars is wasted because of medicare fraud and abuse this hurts not only taxpayers but medicare recipients and legitimate providers as a result congress should do everything in its power to eliminate fraud and abuse this legislation we are introducing moves our efforts from a pay and chase model to one that takes proactive tangible steps to stop fraud before it begins i hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this important effort to protect taxpayers and medicare recipients
27453 the facts of this case to me are quite clear he knew what he was doing he intended to kill a human being and he knew that it was wrong

27472 ok its been a long day im tired hot and pissed off if you can for just once give me an excuse for your terrible driving ive not heard before ill consider letting you go
27473 well last week my wife ran off with a cop and i thought you were trying to bring her back to me
27474 the only way to wear an outfit is with hot shoes a killer smile and a great attitude
27475 the next doom game will look like its built on another engine as it uses three times the horsepower
27476 im using cheap earth abundant materials that you can mass manufacture as long as you can charge the surface you can create the catalyst and it doesnt get any cheaper than that
27477 you cant think about an energy economy or a global energy system only when the sun is out
27478 you could imagine during the day you have a photovoltaic cell you take some of that electricity and use it in your house then take the other part of that electricity for my catalyst feed the catalyst water and you get hydrogen and oxygen
27479 suddenly i saw a clearing in the dark drive ahead and a patch of sky and in a moment the dark trees had thinned the nameless shrubs had disappeared and on either side of us was a wall of colour blood red reaching far above our heads we were amongst the rhododendrons there was something bewildering even shocking about the suddenness of their discovery the woods had not prepared me for them they startled me with their crimson faces massed one upon the other in incredible profusion showing no leaf no twig nothing but the slaughterous red luscious and fantastic unlike any rhododendron plant i had every seen before
27480 we were not far from the house now i saw the drive broaden to the sweep i had expected and with the blood red wall still flanking on either side we turned the last corner and so came to manderley yes there it was the manderley i had expected the manderley of my picture post card long ago a thing of grace and beauty exquisite and faultless lovelier even than i had ever dreamed built in its hollow of smooth grassland and mossy lawns the terraces sloping to the gardens and the gardens to the sea as we drove up to the wide stone steps and stopped before the open door i saw through one of the mullioned windows that the hall was full of people
27481 i completely believe that a game could come out and be more successful than wow im hoping that were working on it right now
27482 i think a lot of other companies have had great opportunities to do what wow has done usually for whatever reason they miss the mark
27483 i actually feel really bad a lot of times when new mmos come out and dont do really well because im not thinking of it from a business perspective i know what its like to be a developer on a team that you believe in on a game that you just love and for some reason you dont get enough time or someone makes a bad decision everybodys making a lot of small choices and when those go wrong your game ends up not successful
27484 not making choices based upon being different but making choices based upon whats good for your game
27485 if there was an mmo out there that had a tone different from wow but was executed as well i actually think there could be a huge audience for that when i get disappointed its because i dont see that level of execution
27486 the same challenge is on us are we going to make the right decisions i dont believe that just because we made wow were guaranteed on the next mmo that we make to have the same success
27487 i really believe youre only as good as your last game i really think you gave to prove it every time

27489 hmm who knows what the big to do is about
27490 algo que nunca ha ocurrido desde tiempos inmemoriales una joven mujer tir ndose un pedo sobre las rodillas de su esposo
27491 run around turn things evil pee on stuff and buttstomp the ground a lot
27492 we believe that when it comes to budget policy we have done the right thing it is the right course of action
27493 and as i said a 22 billion surplus is the best way you can position this economy going forward it gives you a buffer for the future
27494 the big challenge is as you know getting the balance right between not having an economy which is plagued by high levels of inflation forcing interest rates up over the long term while at the same time ensuring enough activity continues to be generated in the economy
27495 we have got our fiscal settings as right as we can but it is going to be tough tough in the sense of the impact on peoples family budgets
27496 look at the overall profitability levels of our banks they are huge therefore i believe they have got a responsibility to pass on
27497 we have had inflation running at 16 year highs as of when we came into office that then flows into interest rates and we have had 12 of those on the trot going up
27498 that then affects the level of activity in the economy and that in turn affects ultimately employment but when it comes to the statistics provided by the abs australian bureau of statistics it is not appropriate for politicians or prime ministers to speculate on future data
27499 the bottom line is we have an impact on the global economy flowing through to australia from the credit crisis coming out of the us sub prime
27500 we have had the further shock to the economy coming off the back of the global oil shock the biggest that weve seen since the 1970s
27501 the key challenge is that we have a course a pathway through this and thats got to be built on a strong approach to budget policy and a strong approach to long term economic reform so that we can come through this in better shape
27502 to join in a day of prayer and fasting that such offenses never happen again
27503 we must win in afghanistan there is no other option
27504 i think the banks will be under huge pressure in the market place to act in response to official interest rate changes
27505 operating in the market these banks have a responsibility to act despite recent adjustments both by the nab and by anz in response to some bad decisions lending decisions made in the past
27506 look at the overall profitability levels of our banks they are huge therefore i believe they have got a responsibility to pass on
27507 i met him once and he was very kind to me i never got a chance to tell him what i thought that he was my hero

27530 hes still taking his time and he hasnt given us an indication if hes going to keep playing or not
27531 you know when he was speaking in sweden about august for making a decision a lot of people picked up that he meant the 1 st of august but he meant sometime in august he would definitely decide whether hell be in a training camp
27532 i dont think the demand will slow down if he takes longer

27535 last year the rough here was almost out of control this year the rough is very average and its part of an experiment theyre doing theyre trying to see if the rough height has any effect on scoring
27536 im not saying its playing easy but the rough is not nearly as thick as it was last year
27537 you fall in love with a golf course when you have a setup thats as wonderful as this
27538 the greens are fast the pin placements are great the rough is challenging but fair and it lets you hit some recovery shots this year firestone is one of my favorite golf courses that we have on tour
27539 the guy thats won here every year is not here and all the losers are still here
27540 its got length its got rough its got tough greens so you need to be on your game

27543 we believe were definitely going to have to hit more in the second half than we hit in the first half
27544 when i talked to junior he said he was very honest and thats what we want from our players
27545 i said were not looking for that guy from seattle what were looking for is for you to use your instincts
27546 center field is actually the easiest of the outfield positions to play from a health perspective i know that doesnt sound right because youve got to go a lot of left and right but trust me its a little easier to play center field
27547 instinctively we feel hes going to give us at least what we were getting out there
27548 remember we didnt have the prototypical guy out there in the first place swish did a heck of a job and hell continue to get some time out there but he isnt the most prototypical guy that you can put out there and you dont have to be if you have good baseball instincts
27549 im going to put the best guys i think we have to give us a better chance to win the game
27550 we brought junior to play but if junior dont play the way we think he should be playing then were going to have guys here to replace we are here to win and we will see how it works
27551 ill deal with that at the end of the season
27552 were just trying to win the 2008 championship but its in the back of our minds
27553 one of the things that factored into this is hes a guy whos had a great career but has not won a championship
27554 how motivated hes going to be to get one that is a factor and will always be a factor to me
27555 its never a bad thing to be in a pennant and have help walk through the door i dont get caught up in the names i get caught up more in fits and need
27556 that is very good news for anyone who believes in the constitution of the united states the separation of powers and the system of checks and balances so we will look forward to reading that ruling more closely and of course it has ramifications for other contempt initiatives that we are considering in the house
27557 resolution recommending that the house of representatives find karl rove in contempt of congress for refusing to comply
27558 this resolution recommends that the house pursue statutory contempt against mr rove and pursue other legal remedies to enforce the subpoena as appropriate it is regrettable but it has become necessary to pursue this course because we have been left with no other option

27572 celebrities are coming onboard because theyre excited about obama like the rest of america
27573 anyone who knows and listens to barack obama doesnt think hes empty headed
27574 if you like exercise you like the idea of getting more bang for your buck
27575 if you dont like exercise you love the idea of getting the benefits from a pill

27578 the whole arena of auto thefts has been a significant problem for us in the past four to five years
27579 watch closely see the white car passing by quick did you catch that plate probably not but with new technology cops will automatically scan plates of all cars driving by and even save them to a database
27580 the advantage of having it in a marked car is if it sees something recognizes it as a stolen license plate then the officers are in a car that they can immediately effect a traffic stop
27581 i actually do think its a good idea i know if my car was stolen id want it back pretty fast
27582 you know i think its be a lot easier to find
27583 if it got my car stolen id be on the phone telling somebody i got it stolen i wouldnt be waiting for a police officer to watch my car drive by and then have them put it into a database
27584 we feel these operations might prey on people with insecurities and fears who actually need psychological help
27585 they are also not very anatomically based and have the potential to cause serious harm
27586 in one case we heard of a man bringing in a brazilian pornographic photo and saying make my girlfriend look like this
27587 we dont think it is ethical behaviour to agree to do that
27588 it is often not clear where the g spot is or if it even exists at all in some women
27589 so the procedure is done without that being verified often causing problems in sex

27595 i would be surprised if someone made a change without at least informing
27596 but i really do not know the detail i only know the ground rules on censorship have changed but have only been announced here it must have related to a former understanding to which i was not a party
27597 this certainly isnt what we guaranteed the international media and its certainly contrary to normal circumstances of reporting on olympic games
27598 i suspect an agreement has been reached or an understanding has been reached
27599 it may well have been done by the executive board done in another place by very senior people in the ioc it may have taken into consideration new circumstances in this year leading up to the games where there has been quite a lot of trauma around china and within china
27600 must show repentance and regret before we can share communion with them
27601 even the pope is elected by his peers but what anglicans have is a man appointed by a secular government

27628 in my estimation and many people in hockey feel the same way steves the strongest candidate in hockey at the executive level that wasnt a gm
27629 we realize there are more and more demands in this business at this level in order to get the job done you need many people doing it ill still be involved in the hockey operations side
27630 i met daryl katz and listening to his plans for this hockey club moving forward big things are coming here
27631 for me watching people in that leadership role with no ego bob nicholson wayne gretzky kevin lowe pat quinn and his coaching staff was so impressive
27632 i knew right away i could get to another level working with those people
27633 this is an opportunity that steve could not pass up and we are in full support of his decision to advance his career
27634 quite frankly when we worked together with team canada i never envisioned this happening
27635 but hockey is an interesting business my favourite motto is expect the unexpected and the unexpected happened in the last four to six days
27636 i do know theres a tremendous amount of potential from our young players this is an exciting team
27637 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
27638 we didnt plan in advance how to move things around
27639 during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
27640 tell you one thing and behind your back they do another thing
27641 i have to share this with the people i love i cant do this justice with my description i have to take photos
27642 its really funny because when we first started seeing each other we both said to each other you know the one thing i missed is i didnt get to see you compete when you were at your best thats what i miss about me too that he could have watched me compete at my best theres no way ill ever compete again but its almost like im seeing him nearly at his best and seeing him play some great golf its a real treat for me this month the wedding the brtitish open this month has been like the best month of our lives i think
27643 when i look back at the british open that he came in third its hard to believe in a good way that he still has that talent and that fire in him now whether its going to be consistently there is another question
27644 i think whats really important is the environment around an athlete and the atmosphere and the dynamic of a family because i see that with our junior tennis players and i think hes just really relaxed and at a good place and feels like hes done it all and doesnt feel pressure if i receive any credit its just to make him feel relaxed but i im not out there hitting the ball
27645 everybodys been so friendly because ive been here before i was here when they dedicated the club and my former coach dennis ralston used to be the pro here
27646 i went to denver for three days and spent three days with my boys because theyre in aspen for the summer with their father they were skateboarding at woodward skateboard park i just watched them the whole time i havent seen them in a month so that was fun
27647 it was one of the toughest decisions ive had to make in golf i was torn i talked about it with chrissy a lot i talked about it with bob collins the president of my company a lot eventually it was my decision
27648 i feel great that i played my way into augusta so i can look forward to that come april
27649 in my whole career i never wanted to be the best in the world i just wanted to be the best i could be my business is definitely like that im very very passionate about it
27650 i mean we all know im not the lone wolf here but we all know if youre happy in life everything else in the world seems pretty darn good
27651 its going to be interesting to see hes a great driver of the golf ball he should be driving the ball in most every fairway long he hits the ball very high
27652 i dont play very much but when i play i play in stretches
27653 i played five weeks in a row and by the end of the five weeks i was pretty good and greg this is his third week in a row and hes got that competition now under his fingernails hes got it right there and so hes fine tuning it and i think that gives him somewhat of an advantage
27654 i could have easily said i was happy with third place in the british open and quite honestly i was upset and disappointed same with the senior british open so thats a good sign for me when i look back on things and im not content with the result
27655 im thinking you know you should have been better you can improve you can improve and hopefully im going to do that this week
27656 i know every human being sometimes feels like theyre the only one at the end of the branch and nobody else is with them when things are going bad
27657 but when things are going great and youre happy about everything it permeates through everything you have in life my golf is where it is now because i love being where i am now
27658 but theyre identical with your mental attitude about wanting to get out there and do well and win so its wonderful to have a companion and your wife to be able to sit back and talk about it sometimes you make a lot of mistakes because you dont have that support team that helps you get around the humps and hollows and ive got one now and its a beautiful thing
27659 we are committed to ensuring that the products that come into america are safe for consumers and that the regulating agencies have what they need in order to do their job
27660 we still have a few concerns but not enough that would keep us from signing the bill

27912 and quite honestly the plywood industry has been dead flat in canada for 10 years weve produced the same volumes for 10 years despite huge increases in wood products demand
27913 stopping the peace process could lead to a violent outburst
27914 we plan to continue the talks on both fronts but that doesnt mean there will be agreements
27915 it is now clear to everyone that this is not about political survival or the desire to attract voters
27916 he could have said i am not going to work any more apres moi le deluge and just dealt with urgent problems
27917 se7en stopped his activities in korea and japan to go to the us but he didnt do that to increase his popularity in korea and japan by creating a buzz about his crossover
27918 the fans have been complaining because there has been little news on se7en there was even an article about se7en having problems with people at yg entertainment
27919 yg entertainment is basically not good at using the media but now we just try not to release news about him to help him
27920 se7en did not go to the states only to help increase his popularity in korea and japan and we are only being cautious about his crossover thats why we do not report details on his current situation in the us so please excuse us
27921 were so addicted to oil that were bathing our children in it

27929 if the politicians have their way our utility bills would increase on average more than 400 a year for 30 years
27930 get the facts on the boards 4 billion takeover plan the board of supervisors could issue bonds in any amount to take over pg amp e without a vote of the people giving city politicians a virtual blank check the city would lose more than 20 million a year which pg amp e pays in taxes and fees so our taxes would need to go up or basic services would need to be cut our utility rates would increase more than 400 per year for 30 years the november election is shaping up to be the most expensive ever for san franciscans we simply cant afford the boards takeover
27931 i really must speak with the other villagers before i can give you an answer
27932 if you look on the web site im no 5
27933 i looked at the depth chart i peeked at it one time just to see
27934 i know that thats obvious im the guy in the preseason game who comes in when all the vets got their reps and i try to show out i try to get 100 yards
27935 if he asks me to go out with the 10th team im going to go out there whenever he calls my number i just want to go out there and do the right thing
27936 i was the air it out champion every year at receiver

27939 i even threw a halfback pass for a touchdown in college
27940 scientists have devised a cheap and simple method of turning water into rocket fuel using solar power in a development that could generate a new source of green energy for the home and workplace the researchers used electricity from solar panels to split water into oxygen and hydrogen the constituents of rocket fuel with a technology that scientists believe could be a way of storing solar energy as a chemical fuel that can be used to power pollution free electricity generators known as hydrogen fuel cells
27941 daniel nocera of the massachusetts institute of technology in boston said the discovery could remove one of the major obstacles that has prevented solar power from being taken up widely as a viable alternative to fossil fuels such as oil and gas
27942 go in the army once i get out of high school and then hopefully go to trade school
27943 we determined the cause of death for this young man was drowning there was no evidence of any foul play on the body and there was nothing to indicate there was any other person involved in anything we found nobody really knows what was going on when he went down there is no evidence of medical problems it may have been he could have simply had a charlie horse
27944 there were counselors who remained there who were concerned about him because he was in fact living with counselors over there those folks waited and worried just as much as if they were parents
27945 the key mission for the united states looking forward is to maintain the cease fires and prevent people from going back to the warpath
27946 their purpose in iraq is increasingly changing from fighting a war to keeping a peace
27947 there is a reason to hope that its going to stay very low
27948 dealing with holdouts rather than trying to break the back of an ongoing insurgency
27949 we received far fewer bodies because of the improved security situation the current rate is close to any normal country
27950 i am optimistic that the worst has passed and we will not see many bodies in the city anymore the iraqi people are no longer interested in continuing the cycle of violence
27951 the number of bodies has declined but i think this is a temporary calm because there are sleeper cells ready to resume their killings anytime
27952 also there are militiamen who have fled the country and might return as soon as possible
27953 think about how i got to the nfl think about how i got to the position im in now i was undrafted man ive been cut three times

27961 takkan menjadi negara pertama yang memiliki senjata nuklir di wilayah tersebut
27962 until the fires extinguished we cant do our full examination and obviously that will be limited by whats left at that stage
27963 i would be surprised if someone made a change without at least informing him rogge
27964 but i really do not know the detail i only know the ground rules on censorship have changed but have only been announced here
27965 this certainly isnt what we guaranteed the international media and its certainly contrary to normal circumstances of reporting on olympic games
27966 ioc spokeswoman giselle davies linked some of the problems to misunderstandings but said late thursday the ioc had met with the chinese organizers and they will remedy the situation
27967 we met today with the organizers because having understood yesterday that there were difficulties with access to some sites which obviously goes against our desire to always have had media having access they need we understand that the organizers tomorrow will confirm how they have remedied the situation
27968 its important to stress that there has not at any stage been a deal where the ioc has entered into an agreement with china to censor the internet there has been no deal with china to censor the internet
27969 sites for amnesty international links to tibet or information on the 1989 tiananmen square massacre for instance are all blocked for reporters working at olympic venues and the main press center
27970 some of our guys have inherent breathing issues and to put them in this environment its worrisome for sure
27971 every athlete the clean ones and the not clean ones should clearly know that we mean business
27972 the ioc will do everything that is humanly possible to have the cleanest possible games
27973 ive come all the way from california for this its going to be my 11th eclipse i try to see them all
27974 nowadays the equipment works well enough that we do have time to look up at the eclipse
27975 its very dramatic and awe inspiring when the darkness suddenly comes thats why thousands of tourists go to see
27976 i took out two canadians maybe the people will start to hate me now
27977 in those two matches the crowd was obviously against me
27978 playing a canadian in front of a home crowd its not too easy to be in this kind of atmosphere im pleased how i handled the whole situation
27979 i just play to win a grand slam champion shes really a great player it was a really tough match
27980 but it was a fun match i enjoyed myself it was a good fight
27981 people just wouldnt bother travelling that distance its too far they would just give the whole board system away they wouldnt get the vets to brucellosis test their sheep or they wouldnt get their dogs vaccinated theyd just give up
27982 the only reason i would leave the land is the finance
27983 the pressure of not being able to get a wage at the end of the weekend do what you like with it
27984 a lot of my mates have gone off farm to get the quick buck at the mine and its not usually by choice they are forced to because we need to make a living
27985 encouraging young people back into farming if they get that first farm buyers grant i really think it would be a step in the right direction to getting people back on the land
27986 i dont think its any different to people getting a handout to their houses i think its an investment in food production in this country and people are talking about the rise of food costs and this sort of thing well its only getting higher because of the cost of farming
27987 definitely potential in agriculture the price of commodity at the moment is quite good it just depends if the weather comes our direction and we can crack a crop and some decent seasons for the livestock as well
27988 not attended by sufficient doubt to warrant the grant of special leave
27989 knowable to the australian federal police and therefore should not be regarded as fresh evidence
27990 the ioc would like to stress that no deal with the chinese authorities to censor the internet has ever in any way been entered into
27991 the issues were put on the table and the ioc requested that the olympic games hosts address them
27992 we understand that bocog will give details to the media very soon of how the matter has been addressed
27993 the deal may well have been done by the executive board done in another place by very senior people in the ioc
27994 slipped on a wet floor awkwardly but denied australian radio suggestions he had been drinking excessively more olympics cycling news
27995 i discusse d that with cadel and after a three week long tour de france all the teams have a team dinner bannan said
27996 my understanding is that what happened was completely accidental and that alcohol was not a factor
27997 theres having a couple of wines to celebrate finishing second in the tour de france and theres binge drinking
27998 knowing cadel hes the ultimate professional and he knows the olympic games is coming up after the tour de france he would not have been binge drinking
27999 with or without alcohol if you slip on a wet floor in the way cadel described it to me you are going to do some damage
28000 so i had to consider going to see a specialist who recommended cancelling my ride in the criterium in belgium on tuesday in favour of getting some scans done evans said
28001 its not a major injury but its something i will have to manage
28002 i recognised i might not be at my absolute best in the race against the clock time trial but i can still make a significant contribution to the team effort for the road race
28003 ill be training and getting treatment over the next few days to confirm my participation by monday
28004 but i will not take a place in beijing if everything doesnt go according to plan
28005 the intensity of the time trial makes it difficult for cadel with his injury bannan said
28006 maybe we have to turn off the life support tomorrow and take him home
28007 the government is very satisfied with the swift action of the greek police in pursuing the perpetrators of this crime and appreciates the high level involvement of very senior police officials in the investigation
28008 we are so ashamed for what happened this is not what we are
28009 el jueves a la noche nos enteramos que faltaban los cuatro y el viernes fue un hermano m o a la casa

28014 it seems the only thing consistent about college costs is that they are going up and going up rapidly
28015 to address soaring costs this legislation will address the transparency and the accountability of the tuition pricing system shining a bright light on the prices set by colleges and universities
28016 theres worry obviously yes we will think about it of course hopefully hes not fighting anymore and going after a guy in the stands
28017 i havent talked to ron yet so its hard to say i have to find a way to talk to him and see what we can do as a basketball team he has a history but we know he is a physical player he is a good player he really can help us and ron is on a contract year too i think ron artest is a good player if coach rick adelman can control the team well
28018 i dont know anybody that knows him personally so im not gonna judge him for anything that i dont know
28019 in places like where i grew up and where i worked there are incredibly high hiv and std rates
28020 this card opens up the conversation for people to talk about it
28021 people in our community dont take the time to check each other and it puts a lot of lives at risk
28022 this card will keep people from lying and get it all out in the open
28023 it will let you know whos safe and whos not its definitely a good idea
28024 our goal is to make it easy for people to get this done
28025 during and after working hours both on and off the premises and with the actual knowledge of his peers and superiors he used and continues to use his position of power and authority over vulnerable economically dependent and emotionally vulnerable subordinates to seduce or compel as circumstances might warrant intimate sexual relations of conventional as well as deviate nature
28026 im not this awful person and the allegations are not true
28027 i never heard any such claims until after she was fired and most of the allegations occurred while we were both with another firm and before i was with my new firm she called and asked to come to work for us
28028 you can file anything and the district clerk has to take it there is a quality control mechanism at the eeoc and she never made a complaint there
28029 she left the oquinn law firm went to work for another firm reapplied to the oquinn firm and was hired back then she left to work with laminacks firm if there is a long history of a hostile work environment why do you voluntarily subject yourself to it not once but twice
28030 it should be like at airports everything gets checked even your body gets checked
28031 it should be the same thing for buses people should be safer on the bus because now i dont feel safe
28032 a lot of people have talked about airport style security but the rural nature of our network doesnt allow us to have that type of security
28033 i also want to acknowledge the driver and the other passengers on the bus
28034 since all the votes have been cast before the meeting all thats really left is the theater
28035 i want to hold this board and management team accountable for the last year
28036 it will not do shareholders or yahoo any good to have the annual meeting turn into a media event for no purpose
28037 i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship
28038 a whats good yeah im free and ready to do me but its still dip set 4 life its just going to be a new chapter

28058 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
28059 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
28060 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
28061 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
28062 is using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
28063 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
28064 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
28065 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
28066 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton
28067 i respect and admire sen obama we just have stark differences
28068 campaigns are tough but im proud of the campaign we have run
28069 im proud of the issues we have tried to address with the american people all i can say is we are proud of that commercial
28070 we can most assuredly tell you that voters around the country do not think theres anything substantive about this latest ad do not think its something that john mccain should be proud of
28071 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
28072 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
28073 the new york jets are in serious talks with the green bay packers and brett favres agent about acquiring the legendary quarterback a source said today the jets and tampa bay buccaneers are the only teams that have permission to speak with favre about a potential trade for now favres agent bus cook has been in talks with the jets who have shown a growing interest but cook has not been working closely with the buccaneers according to two sources favre would have to sign off on any trade before a new team would be willing to give up compensation for him because if he refuses to report to the new teams camp the trade would be voided the extent of cooks talks with the jets means favre at least is considering playing for them
28074 all but over favre to go to jets its over favre traded to jets

28081 we finally have a team that threatens the all blacks
28082 look no further than luke burgess for years we had a half back who they just didnt see as a threat now we do all those guys need to do is back themselves and enjoy it
28083 there was a fantastic feeling out of that win over the all blacks
28084 i dont know about the scars of the past i wasnt part of it that was my first test against the all blacks but we also know this one in auckland is going to be ferocious and amazing
28085 he talked about being able to focus on your own potential and your own goals and having that clear definite one pointed focus where nothing else stands in your way
28086 wayne actually sent me a happy 7th birthday card through some friends that year i loved the tigers
28087 his pluck he gives and gives and he loves playing
28088 sometimes ive got to tell him to stop rein himself in at training
28089 weve got to keep backing that and mastering the when and where you pull things out
28090 you just cant play conservatively at test level and achieve what wed like
28091 if burgo is threatening the defence theres always more space outside
28092 yeah mummie got that started and phil waugh wont let it go
28093 im not too happy about it i think its because he considers me intelligent and mclovins a hit with the ladies
28094 youd not meet a more genuine guy he energises a team but id advise a chocolate ban at nights because its like hes on a sugar high all the time
28095 robbies brought in that fresh open mind and with luke hes got the most complete young halfback of the past decade

28098 were not in the situation that the afl in melbourne is in where clubs are actually getting financial assistance
28099 but if it gets to that point well have to consider that to maintain our saturation coverage across the city
28100 im not a fan of the idea that cutting teams in sydney is the answer
28101 people are quick to say lets cut clubs but theyre not so quick to say which ones culling sydney teams ignores the huge advantage we get with saturation in the most competitive market in the country
28102 apart from the pain it causes for fans it leaves holes for other codes to fill
28103 i dont think perth and adelaide will be ready there wont be the interest by then
28104 weve got quite isolated communities in some of the places that i just named
28105 manly is an example of a community that is actually reasonably isolated there are people who drive over the spit bridge on friday night and have no intention of going back until monday morning
28106 theres a good chance if theres no team playing out of brookvale those people are not going to the footy
28107 penrith the same cronulla the same in melbourne people tend to travel into the city to the grounds with relative ease
28108 the simple fact is that coffs harbour and the sunshine coast dont have the facility or the community to support a football club that needs to be turning over at least 12million a year
28109 we certainly want to do some work to research growth areas and look at where our best returns will come from
28110 gina cobb is proof that not all lawyers deserve the death penalty
28111 our focus as a company right now is on the atom platform but im sure other people in the community will drive it in other directions
28112 i want to see the community that really takes this project and runs with it and makes it their project
28113 open source is something that we believe really helps change the game
28114 sun has given use more free hands to do what we want to do
28115 if we didnt play that game we would never have known we are good enough to play that way against the best side in the competition and possibly the best side we have seen for a while
28116 to know that we can do that in times of adversity like this we can draw on those moments to give ourselves a bit of belief had we not played that well what are we going to draw on
28117 mick malthouse always says you learn so much about someone in times of adversity
28118 we have got a lot on the line and i certainly have full confidence in my teammates
28119 i have seen it before last year everyone doubted us but we believe we can play good footy and make an impact
28120 we are really looking forward to the challenge of playing hawthorn given what happened last time
28121 our form hasnt been great in the last couple of weeks but we have learnt a lot as a team and learnt a lot about each other since then
28122 sono solo 20 giorni solo 480 ore solo 28800 minuti solo 1728000 secondi solo solo

28133 no matter how strongly a large number of shareholders feel about the boards previous actions
28134 it is not going to be a retirees board the benefit of having icahn on the board is the status quo is broken it is going to be under an awful lot pressure to act
28135 some of the bigger shareholders want to push for a new ceo
28136 there is a small possibility that shareholder disappointment results in jerry yang being moved aside in a sort of bloodless coup

28143 as a private club phoenix country club does not discuss internal affairs especially membership issues
28144 most men are indifferent to the policy or are against it
28145 but you become a leader of the club by being visible and you become visible by being seen in the mens grill and the way the mens grill is set up suits those men
28146 it became clear to me that there is a silent majority here that wants these changes or recognizes that its time for them to go

28153 its tragic but the means of his death trying to save his wife is the way he lived his professional life
28154 steve had all the qualities you would want in a friend or attorney passion loyalty and a pronounced sense of fairness
28155 when a lawyer had a question or needed to counsel needed somebody to talk to they would go to steve i cant tell you how many people have called and referred to steve as their very best friend in the world
28156 its a complete abuse of the criminal justice process to try to resolve civil complaints or civil disputes by using the hammer of the criminal justice system
28157 as a trial lawyer he was fearless but always fair and his adversaries left the courtroom even after a tenacious battle respecting him im going to miss him more than i can imagine
28158 nice is such an insipid word but he was such a fine person to work with he always gave it his all
28159 steve chaykin was a loyal and thoughtful alum and trustee
28160 he loved his alma mater and we all loved and respected him the entire university community joins me in mourning his loss
28161 what we dont like to see are ugly signs leaning up against buildings and taking up the right of way
28162 we actually think this going to be kind of fun its a way to give incentive to people to make some quality signage
28163 that little placard has done a lot of work for us we try to make it look pleasant we try to keep it out of peoples way
28164 for some small business this is the kind of things we need to grow
28165 the president made very clear that he would use this 45 day period to assess the dprks north koreas cooperation including on reaching agreement on a verification protocol and respond accordingly
28166 a little more than 10 days left before the first opportunity for the president to open that window and de list the north
28167 i will say that without this action which we hope the north will take the de listing will not occur on that time line
28168 agree to a verification protocol that included the plutonium program the highly enriched uranium activities and the proliferation efforts
28169 if verification must cover the three big issues that certainly makes it more difficult than if you only focus on plutonium
28170 all future negotiations with north korea except those specifically dealing with hugh downs reports
28171 mr fukuda said that he wants to reshuffle his cabinet today
28172 the prime minister asked us for our cooperation in the reshuffle
28173 i think most people parents and children appreciate the choice
28174 you can decide what school you want to attend and that appeals to people
28175 if you run a good operation then you make a profit but you wont get any students if you are bad
28176 you have to do a good job to get money that is even more important for a private school
28177 today i think we have at least as good quality if not better than some independent schools because we have really joined the battle and use our money in a much better way
28178 they just put their child on that yellow bus and bus them to another failing school
28179 these kids are trapped in those schools and the parents dont have a clue
28180 if im looking for current information i just call the school or i go on the california education website
28181 we found through a lab test that there were dangerous chemicals but it began with the school accountability report card
28182 we love the intent of the school accountability report cards
28183 but the public probably has very little interest in reading 14 pages of text and tabs of data that are a couple years old those who are interested are realtors and attorneys
28184 it levels the playing field and we owe it to our customers
28185 its a useful tool in spite of the hours it takes to do it

28188 for too many years libya has refused to accept responsibility for its horrific acts of terrorism against american victims
28189 but after the pressure we applied libya can finally be held accountable for these devastating events now these victims and their families can get the long overdue justice they deserve
28190 we think that for the families of the victims this is the right move
28191 we think it will allow them the fair and just compensation that theyve been seeking in an expeditious manner

28197 if the dating remains as inconclusive as what we have had so far a homicide inquiry is unlikely
28198 if the dating is more specific a homicide inquiry is a possibility
28199 qualcomms counsel participated in an organized program of litigation misconduct and concealment throughout discovery trial and post trial
28200 mental impressions conclusions opinion or legal theories of an attorney
28201 thus we sometimes see a petitioner in a reply brief abandoning weak arguments
28202 or attempting to answer for the first time the most difficult arguments against her position
28203 could save a lot of time and the cost to their clients by not preparing a reply brief
28204 a properly drafted reply brief can offer insight into the issues most in contention between the parties
28205 regrettably replies are frequently ill conceived and simply reargue the opening brief
28206 perhaps this is done in the hope that what is read last makes the lasting impression
28207 these types of reply briefs do make an impression but an unfavorable one
28208 positions are staked out in the opening and response briefs
28209 and one would start consideration of the legal issues and modify ones tentative conclusion based on the reply brief
28210 my experience is that the supreme court is very very liberal at granting requests for more words
28211 but one sentiment among appellate lawyers is why should we invite all these requests just double the number of words
28212 this helps narrow the issues for me before i read appellants brief
28213 theres nothing more frustrating than spending a lot of time struggling with something in appellants brief only to find respondent concedes it or attacks it on a completely different basis than the one anticipated by the appellant
28214 appellant may abandon something he spent 20 pages on in opening brief after hearing respondents reply or may have a devastating comeback or devastating lack of a comeback to something respondent says
28215 the reply brief to me was the most important document in the process
28216 its the appellants last attempt to show why notwithstanding what the respondent says the appellant should win
28217 they are not only your best opportunity to convince the court of the bankruptcy of your adversarys arguments they may also be your only opportunity given the limited time available for oral argument
28218 it gives you a clue its not a strong case
28219 if the proceeding was a joke and stated to the court youre going to sit your ass up there
28220 the defendant argues that it is irrelevant whether or not the producers intended to portray king in a negative light
28221 but i thought we had enough here to get by summary judgment
28222 it comes as no surprise king may have associated with people who were unsavory or labeled as con artists
28223 a proxy for the principal location of the insured risk
28224 although the location of the risk can be a compelling factor in a choice of law analysis it is necessary for courts to modify the location of the insured risk rule when the risk is located in several states
28225 the hudson river the single biggest site to have been contaminated might cost more than 1 billion
28226 new york laws are more favorable for insurers because of the application of pollution exclusion clauses which other states interpret more favorably for policy holders the late notice requirement which in new york does not require a showing of prejudice and allocation issues which under new york laws would spread ges damages across insurance policies rather than allowing them to lump damages as they want under a single policy year
28227 in a purely procedural decision the court applied new yorks choice of law rules and determined that new york law should be applied rather than the law of the site or massachusetts law
28228 ge has resolved its environmental coverage claims with the vast majority of its insurers
28229 against the few remaining insurers and ge expects to recover insurance proceeds from those remaining defendants
28230 full coverage for its claims for any policy in effect during the time period of the injury or damage
28231 rather this dispute concerns the extent to which ge or the insurers must bear the cost of the environmental cleanup
28232 it would be not only an enormous burden to consider the laws of numerous states on every issue in this case but such an approach would make uniform interpretation of the contract impossible
28233 we think that the courts decision is extremely well reasoned and fully comports with all of new york conflicts principles
28234 this was an important threshold question that will narrow the issues and reduce the claims to be addressed in the case
28235 people will land on their feet but it is going to take a bit of time and people may be forced to reinvent themselves
28236 the need for mortgage backed securitization expertise has constricted dramatically
28237 there is no way every lawyer that was doing that work 18 months ago can find that work next month
28238 there are so many lawyers in the market for those few positions that might draw that background
28239 sixth and seventh year associates and counsel are going to have a much harder time
28240 when you get to that stage in your career it is really difficult to slot into another firms partnership track
28241 this decision should send a clear signal to the bush administration that it must cooperate fully with congress and that former administration officials harriet miers and karl rove must testify before congress
28242 i have not yet talked with anyone at the white house and dont expect that this matter will be finally resolved in the very near future
28243 harriet miers is not immune from compelled congressional process she is legally required to testify pursuant to a duly issued congressional subpoena
28244 that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law
28245 if the administration appeals the ruling our congressional prerogatives will once again be put at risk
28246 we look forward to the white house complying with this ruling and to scheduling future hearings with ms miers and other witnesses who have relied on such claims
28247 we hope that the defendants will accept this decision and expect that we will receive relevant documents and call ms miers to testify in september
28248 i look forward to working with the white house and the justice department to coordinate the long overdue appearances
28249 im sure it will be appealed and it will go on into next year and it will become a moot issue
28250 under the plaintiffs trial plan at least 6 000 individual trials on exposure injury causation damages and other individual issues will have to be prosecuted whether or not a class is certified presumably by the lawyers already retained by the personal injury claimants this is not a case where class certification avoids clogging the federal courts with innumerable individual suits litigating the same issues repeatedly if class certification is denied these cases will go forward in essentially the same manner they would if a class were certified only without an expensive unnecessary meaningless and largely uncontested common issues trial
28251 it was one of the ways we proposed to deal with the masses of cases
28252 now we simply need to deal with all the cases that are here
28253 a number of cases in state courts throughout the country
28254 we actually dont comment on litigation i can tell you that we do remain committed to addressing any consumer concerns related to our peanut butter recall
28255 it goes without saying that class certification is impossible where the fifty states truly establish a large number of different legal standards governing a particular claim
28256 have failed to carry their burden that there are no material variations in state law
28257 the many differences among jurisdictions would prevent the court from finding that common issues of law predominate on this claim
28258 at oral argument the plaintiffs counsel suggested that the damages formula would be based upon the retail value of all the peanut butter sold during the class period or conagras profits from peanut butter during the period
28259 thus the actual injury to the plaintiffs purchasers class and the proposed remedy are completely disconnected
28260 the issue then is whether non litigation alternatives may be considered when making a judgment on the superiority of class action litigation
28261 the defendant claims that it has paid nearly 3 million directly to consumers for claims relating to more than 941 000 jars of peanut butter
28262 in addition conagra has paid more than 30 665 293 to retailers to compensate them for refunds they issued to consumers or for product they had in their possession at the time of the recall
28263 for these reasons the court does not share the plaintiffs concern that the refund program is minimal or even illusory
28264 this is not a case where damages may be calculated using some formula statistical analysis or other essentially mechanistic method
28265 although conagra has not formally admitted liability it is highly unlikely that it will deny that salmonella contaminated peanut butter is a defective product and makes people sick who eat it the court is not convinced that an issues class would promote judicial economy or materially advance the litigation
28266 for example can eating peanut butter that is contaminated with the bacteria listed above cause illness but why bother having a trial on issues of such abstract generality
28267 such as what the defendant knew or should have known and the adequacy of its general plant sanitation practices in relation to the onset of illness for thousands of people would require special interrogatories and a verdict form of unimaginable complexity
28268 i cannot imagine how to fashion a verdict form that would provide meaningful answers to overarching epidemiological questions in this case
28269 congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof

28277 as a matter of policy we do not comment on pending litigation however as soon as this matter has been cleared in the courts we will inform our readers as to the outcome of the litigation

28296 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
28297 when he was attacking him he was calm like he was at the beach
28298 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
28299 was cutting his head off and pretty much gutting him
28300 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
28301 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
28302 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting
28303 he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal

28310 if he has surgery im going to obviously do all i can to try to come back next year and help this team win

28418 the crime has signs of premeditation mohamed ali called cara to his apartment put the music on high volume and killed her with knife blows he then took her body to the bathroom and then he went off to a party it said
28419 it was only the following day he dismembered the girls body he took various photos of the chopped up body with his cellphones camera including photos like those of the taliban where the decapitated head is placed on top of the body it said
28420 every new governor general has the right to decide who her or his official secretary should be

28422 she no hurt anymore she play with max she happy
28423 overall inflation remains robust even though a price increase in utilities accounted for almost half of the total monthly increase
28424 if this is the case the peak in yearly inflation that looks to have formed should be confirmed
28425 the monetary policy deliberations from the rba board next tuesday will be a tug of war between these recessionary indicators and the still high rate of inflation as shown in the inflation gauge for july
28426 i remain of the view that this demand component is unlikely to be removed without further tightening of monetary policy
28427 like all australian financial services companies our result for the 2008 financial year has been affected by external factors including the global credit crunch volatile equity markets and a succession of severe weather events
28428 this is purely an accounting and timing issue which will reverse as the investments redeem or as credit spreads contract
28429 our businesses are in good shape integration is progressing well and delivering the synergies we targeted our customer base has grown and satisfaction across all brands continues to improve
28430 this assumes weather events remain within the groups normal provisioning and there is no further widening of credit spreads across the groups technical reserves portfolio
28431 what is this protected space that they are entitled to that the rest of us are not entitled to
28432 paris hiltons out of town things are quiet lindsay lohans got a new girlfriend thats keeping things quiet and evidently britney spears has gone straight now in terms of cleaning her act up so basically paparazzi are losing interest
28433 i am not ashamed of what i do everybody benefits from the paparazzi retail hotels tourism
28434 the suncorp announcement this morning is having an impact across the financial sector further dampening confidence
28435 uncertainty continues to linger particularly over the financial and industrial sectors
28436 no is he anywhere near miguel cotto no is he anywhere near cory spinks no is he anywhere near micky ward no way
28437 these are some of the opposition ive dealt with mayweather was the pound for pound king and i went 12 rounds with him for the first six rounds he didnt know what to do with me the only way he really got me was i ran out of gas
28438 god forbid i had a full tank of gas what would have happened
28439 i just came in and started working out so im acclimated to the weather the heat and altitude and i just feel a whole lot better
28440 i feel so much more confident and at ease with the way things are going i can only say that saturday youre going to see one of the best performances youve seen zab judah do in a long time
28441 destroy him way worse than how cotto did it last year
28442 and after beating judah i want to go in the ring again against margarito
28443 a lot of wrestling interviews are boring plain and simple they dont say anything you never heard before
28444 your basic wrestling interview is you ask me how am i going to do and i say im going to do my best
28445 im going to china for a gold medal of course its a big challenge
28446 if you expose your back to the mat in freestyle and do collegiate wrestling you give up points
28447 ive watched every match on video from the 2005 2006 and 2007 worlds
28448 i said ok im not as good as i want to be
28449 his commitment to a work ethic day in and day out doesnt waiver
28450 ive learned that what he says is going to happen
28451 i took out two canadians maybe the people will start to hate me now
28452 in those two matches the crowd was obviously against me
28453 playing a canadian in front of a home crowd its not too easy to be in this kind of atmosphere im pleased how i handled the whole situation
28454 with what happened in his last start its kind of hard for me to be as confident as i was for the derby and his other races
28455 but i cant see him doing something other than run his race i dont see any reason why he wouldnt
28456 im expecting to see the same big brown we saw in the kentucky derby and preakness
28457 but id be lying if i didnt say there is a nagging thought in the back of your mind that maybe the belmont is a sign that not all is right thats what makes the haskell so interesting
28458 we are privileged to welcome the legendary scotty bowman to the chicago blackhawks family
28459 his hockey genius vision and energy are a perfect fit with our goal to win the stanley cup
28460 lord i dunno man but we better call the authorities he needs an ambulance
28461 its been 6 months since the entire world went green and got rid of all motor vehicles all we have are bicycles and dog sleds
28462 well something more than a bicycle ran this guy over im calling for help
28463 nah you can mangle a guy like this with a skate board oh god is his arm is hanging by a thread
28464 i called the medics ol pal someone will come right away
28465 diya think theyll put him in the compost heap or the organic dump
28466 its going to come down to the little things like squares and circles and double triple and so on
28467 what theyve done is taking a step in the right direction but i dont think its a big enough step
28468 will evaluate every situation individually and take actions as appropriate
28469 what we hear from our customers is that they really want the iphone not just because its a cool device but they want to do stuff with it and i dont think thats been catered for in the market so far
28470 we heard pretty loud and clear from customers that they want data one gigabyte per month is fair but its not generous we want customers who scoff at one gigabyte to have the option to get more
28471 its odd that wireless broadband pricing seems to be different to mobile data pricing and so were shooting to rectify that
28472 i think as customers become more savvy they will start to realise that data over a network is just data over a network regardless of the device used
28473 we dont think it was a violation or any negligence on his part
28474 more than 100 california physicians bought it thinking it was suitable and received reprimands from the board
28475 the doctors were looking for a product that was cheaper for their patients
28476 he identified the mass he referred the patient for a mammogram and an ultrasound she did not follow up
28477 we got rid of cronyism kick backs and sweetheart deals
28478 a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
28479 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
28480 race will not have any role in my campaign nor is there any place for it im disappointed that hes used it
28481 for example i made a pdf of todays digg homepage that includes links to no less than three
28482 edmonton has become a trash bin the cuban athletes were poorly attended
28483 to what is owed the fear by the rich and powerful of our small and blockaded island
28484 last week senator obama skipped a visit with wounded u s troops at landstuhl regional medical center in germany because the pentagon would not allow campaign staff or media to accompany him into the hospital i served as director of trauma surgery at that hospital for nearly four years and saw the effect that a visit from a celebrity like senator obama could have on morale during that time i do not recall a single member of congress canceling a visit with the troops despite being just a few hours away but senator obama seems to have been more concerned with how the visit would affect him than how it would affect the soldiers recovering from wounds received in the service of their country
28485 what is amazing this year is how many people have bought the fundamentally childish notion that if you dont like the way things are going the answer is to write a blank check for generic change empowering someone chosen not on the basis of any track record but on the basis of his skill with words
28486 the fourth fleet will send a strong signal to all navies operating in the region
28487 whats good for latin america is good for the united states of america
28488 the touchstone will be fairness which in relation to establishment early termination prepayment and default fees will be linked to cost or loss
28489 default fees will include the sorts of fees labelled as exception fees by the australian bankers association all other fees will be reviewable for unfairness which will not carry an express definition
28490 a contractual term which has not been individually negotiated shall be regarded as unfair if contrary to the requirement of good faith it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations arising under the contract to the detriment of the consumer
28491 we can expect one of the worst months in the auto industry so far
28492 when the threshold was introduced in 1979 only 2 5 of vehicles exceeded the limit and now it is more than 11
28493 it would surprise many people to know that australias top selling luxury vehicle is not a porsche ferrari rolls royce or bentley but in fact it is a toyota landcruiser families and particularly those living in rural and regional areas will increasingly be adversely affected if the proposed tax increase goes ahead
28494 the reports findings indicate that a greater respect for workplace relations laws has led to improved productivity
28495 oakland raider musings random thoughts from the dark side on the raiders training camp to date
28496 quick jabs more margarito cotto de la hoya pacquiao 2008 so far and ahead more
28497 i wouldnt say hes close ive been saying all along and well leave it at that when hes ready hell let us know
28498 my knees been shaky for a while now it was nothing that was ever too much of a concern to let me play or anything like that but its been like that for a while it wasnt too long after i got it initially fixed that it was like that
28499 it gives us some flexibility its a little bit but its not a little bit when youre talking about the cap and getting close to the luxury tax its the flexibility it gives us its more about where we are salary wise
28500 i just got off the phone with steve kyler of hoopsworld and he told me that we will be signing shawn kemp to participate in training camp he says otis is looking for pf depth with veterans which is why he let augustine go expect to see this on the wire in a couple of hours
28501 packers training camp can be fun even if you dont like football
28502 i cant say enough how sorry we are and its our responsibility being nascar that we dont go through this situation again
28503 the race didnt come off like we had hoped the fans didnt get what they exactly wanted and well do everything in our power it wont happen again i can tell you that much
28504 75 percent of the world is covered by water the rest is covered by smoot
28505 shes from south carolina country girl actually shes a tweener shes what i call a tweener play as a linebacker and a d end you know her moms white her dads black
28506 he is a hall of fame quarterback and a hell of a talent that is all people who hold petty grudges against a character flaw that is not really hurting anyone should be just as accountable as fans of favre who love him and are willing to overlook it
28507 papers are signed and sent brett favre files for reinstatement
28508 i am fired up for this season i want to be a green bay packer and lead the team to a super bowl
28509 hey i dont catch the ball i knock the s down ok
28510 in oakland we only had handful of plays and just disguised them up to look different here were actually running different plays
28511 oakland raiders news todays camp a hit for jarrod cooper and a miss for jamarcus russell
28512 i think as he continues to progress this way we can start thinking about getting him back
28513 its the old setback if he can avoid the setbacks i think we can continue to be optimistic that hes going to return and i would have to say relatively soon
28514 we are taking a good look at him right now and he has been responding very well seems to be that the recovery is a little bit quicker so well see
28515 the pirates are deep into trade talks with the tampa bay rays
28516 yeah it was good to see michael bush today that is the most we have done as far as allowing him to lower his pads we dont want to bring guys to the ground but he looked really good in short yardage and goal line hopefully he carries that over to the games
28517 he has looked great he is really showing a lot of leadership in the huddle and in the classroom as i said before with michael huff being a shadow right now to him he is paying off extremely well for us with his play but also with his affect on the rest of the secondary
28518 there was the first play which i was fine with
28519 you got grown men out here playing football bumping into each other somebodys going to get mad and today i got mad yesterday somebody else got mad but i took the mad role today it worked
28520 i got a little heated on the second one i probably shouldnt have tackled the rookie but first of all hes a rookie so im not worried about him but you got to be smart
28521 no we have a competition for number two between those guys they will both play a ton in pre season to see who can move us and who can make really good decisions the backup quarterback will be decided by who takes care of the ball the best
28522 he has made a number of plays for us down the field on balls
28523 raider nation is known for many outlandish and menacing costumes during raiders events and games theres a raider a gorilla darth vader but i dont think theres a batman
28524 yeah we continue to try and put him in situations we are working on a lot of press coverage we have told our corners to come up and press him to really challenge him we need him and jamarcus to understand that when guys are pressed up that we have to go at them its a mentality that we develop and that those two develop
28525 in fact the one double he allowed making a bad dive for the fukudome ball
28526 cameron got a web gem for his play at the wall on a lee blast it was a good play but a web gem especially when he and hart combined in the miscommunication game to allow a double to ramirez huh what does a different play have to do with the web gem play
28527 it all depends on how good the report is if it is real hot do the dance and hope it is not an hr violaton
28528 this is the one year i didnt want the angels to make a trade
28529 angels get teixiera analysis of the deal and its impact
28530 were a little disappointed because he plays the nickel for us he really needs working at it
28531 we had some specific things we thought we could help him with so its going to slow down that process but hell just have to study those three weeks
28532 im not too happy with my role but im going to ball anyway
28533 thank you for 10 great years youve touched our lives with your kindness love and generosity we are forever grateful

28546 chemistry is not destiny of course lightfoot hopes to use his research to help determine which patients may need a bigger boost to get moving he thinks that perhaps close supervision by trainers or rewards for exercising will encourage genetic lazybones to get to the gym and maybe one day he speculates there might even be a drug to compensate for what your genes wont give you a drug that makes you want to exercise now thats a pill worth swallowing
28547 tourists are really discovering austin and theres so much demand we have people call all the time and say what do you mean youre full theres plenty of room for others
28548 we are very pleased to put an end to the speculation and rumors by announcing that we have completed construction of the 10 story base and have begun construction of the residential tower sales have exceeded expectations and this project is full steam ahead

28551 you could have gone into your brothers room got them and cleaned them
28552 then you would have complained about me going into my brothers room
28553 to do this business you have to have a generous spirit because youre taking care of people
28554 in this day and age the word service is somewhat lost
28555 we never really had a total concept of what we were doing kind of naive on our part when you think about it we never really thought everything through
28556 for me the most important thing is the freshness and the flavour of the food we generally dont mess with it too much letting it stand on its own so it will work in combination with other things
28557 there are no lines here ill have clients come into the kitchen and talk to me while im cooking some of them even cook their own meals
28558 i remember one regular slipped his shoes off while eating she stole them and for dessert brought them back stuffed full of parsley
28559 i actually get into trouble when i try to change the menu we put specials on which are very seasonal but the regulars want to come in and eat their favourite thing
28560 im at the point where people say well you should hire somebody back away but i just love cooking i love going to the market to see whats new whats exciting whats coming out thats how i get jazzed
28561 for me i have only one other passion and thats monica

28580 indestructible as the memories we have of them those killed
28581 a lot of families ideas were included in the design its very different the stelae remind me that prior to july 7 these 52 people that died stood tall in this world the material itself is as indestructible as the memories we have of them we wanted a proper memorial so we have taken our time
28582 using the language of architecture to make order out of chaos this monument is an opportunity for loss victims to be in contact with the living through a process of discovery where the memorials structure becomes complete through the presence and body language of the curious visitor
28583 it is a shocking indictment that after 100 years of the state pension we still have millions of older people living in poverty and many more struggling to make ends meet

28608 so it was a nice walk on tuesday with these guys and i got up and struck the ball nicely i said ok new week lets just go at it again
28609 i played well i just couldnt get it over the hump
28610 some were very mushy very soft they put a lot of moisture in some greens and not in others
28611 it was tough judging especially the second shot not knowing what the golf ball was going to do it got into a bit of a guessing game at the end of the day
28612 its such a mental brain drain by the time you do your calculations and try to figure out whether its 20 percent or 30 percent or 18 percent
28613 by the time you do the math in your head then you have to figure out what shot you want to hit
28614 it was a good day you cant be displeased with a 65 on this course or any course
28615 i hate to say it i think i could have shot a 61 or 62 today
28616 i mean his was the open championship mine was the senior open championship but still when you have it in your grasp like that you have something a little bit in common

28621 its such a mental brain drain by the time you do your calculations and try to figure out whether its 20 percent or 30 percent or 18 percent
28622 by the time you do the math in your head then you have to figure out what shot you want to hit
28623 it should be like at airports everything gets checked even your body gets checked
28624 it should be the same thing for buses people should be safer on the bus because now i dont feel safe
28625 a lot of people have talked about airport style security but the rural nature of our network doesnt allow us to have that type of security
28626 i also want to acknowledge the driver and the other passengers on the bus
28627 its going to come down to the little things like squares and circles and double triple and so on
28628 what theyve done is taking a step in the right direction but i dont think its a big enough step
28629 will evaluate every situation individually and take actions as appropriate
28630 its amazing how many club officials read fire brand of the american league

28640 im writing because to do otherwise is to think we rang the hospital my father has just come back from surgery i want to say no more not for reasons of discretion but just because i dont think its right to do that i try not to think about let alone verbalise certain things i can only exist from minute to minute as i have been doing for the last few days my thoughts are elsewhere i wait for another hour another phone call writing this is an escape and i wouldnt write it if i wasnt going to post it it has been a long morning in the longest three days of my life since monday evening i have done so much sitting waiting thinking and changing in however small a degree as a person my attitude towards bloggers has also changed the very act of blogging it strikes me now has always been a positive thing i have always made much about writing comedy as a means of making a moral statement about how we should live ive always been inspired by lord byron whose early life was couched in writing bleak melancholic poems such as childe harold but in later years chose to write don juan one of the finest comic poems ever composed he clearly made a choice i never thought of bloggers doing the same i never before realised how much we are a community that we choose to contribute for whatever reasons of whatever ways we are contributing to something that is wholly good we have rebels we have conservatives i have always seen myself as a rebel i would always do things that ran counter to the prevailing current even in the last few weeks i have annoyed people when i only wished to amuse them its to be expected people who appreciate my humour the things i want to say would find me eventually some might enjoy or see the point in what i try to do that a few have understood me has always been of great pride for me the real world is not much of a world at least not in the north west and living in my words and through my words i tend not to want too much an outer world i dont drink i dont smoke i dont go clubbing i just write and be with a family they sustain me its only friends that i meet online that i come to know and choose by reading their blogs that have become some of the closest friends i have i quote them daily as though i have only just met them that morning its hard to convey but as an anonymous commenter puts it a blogger becomes a secret family member and best friend and they are a special breed however i never really truly understood this until i witnessed the depth of the support ive received in the last few days there havent been hundred of emails but there have been a few all of which have been very meaningful to me some make me cry some make my heart swell when it has only been feeling small and insignificant the messages have sustained me but not in large obvious ways i feel like somebody has reached out and shared a moments warmth with me in this theres everything that we forget about being human being civilised being together i questioned when i wrote my previous post feeling like hell lying in bed at six am yesterday after three hours of weak broken sleep that i was reducing my fathers suffering to a blog event i disabled comments because i didnt want to make it feel like some fiction i am glad that i did that but i am even happier that you still reached out to me i still wait i still worry i still feel so much hurt but i am also proud to have discovered so many real and decent people

28667 nonetheless if there are concerns about how gtech is addressing the problem of vacant land and our approach to community development it is my responsibility to take responsibility for misconceptions or inadequate communication
28668 were trying something really new here right before we started someone dumped a huge load of asphalt on black street and were just past cleaning that up
28669 i know is that it is important to connect the burgeoning green economy to marginalized communities that role of connectivity is one that we at gtech hope to work toward
28670 i am truly saddened to think that friends peers and members of the community would question our intentions i will certainly try to improve lines of communication there is no doubt that we could do better fortunately everyday presents a new opportunity to do so

28706 oracle is a very complex product set and i think theyre trying to get some new products into the lower end of the market
28707 time will tell if they can do that with ingram but theyve had other distributors in the past that havent been successful
28708 this arrangement is designed for organisations that make ad hoc enquiries and limited sales per year
28709 ingram micro sells to many thousands of resellers those most likely to see our strong value proposition will have software licensing as part of their portfolio because there are good opportunities to make reasonable margins on our products
28710 they will also be attractive to partners selling services and we are keen to nurture that
28711 itx has a number of very strong products like sun and hp that they represent strongly and attract a certain type of reseller

28738 while thankful to be safely outside of eritrea emmanuel explains that in addition to the general problems of refugee camp life such as insufficient food rations and health concerns like malaria it is not easy to get out of the camp to carry out normal activities such as using the internet
28739 he upraised this standard of the oneness of humanity in prison when subjected to banishment by two kings while a refugee from enemies of all nations and during the days of his long imprisonment he wrote to the kings and rulers of the world in words of wonderful eloquence arraigning them severely and summoning them to the divine standard of unity and justice he exhorted them to peace and international agreement making it incumbent upon them to establish a board of international arbitration that from all nations and governments of the world there should be delegates selected for a congress of nations which should constitute a universal arbitral court of justice to settle international disputes he wrote to victoria queen of great britain the czar of russia the emperor of germany napoleon iii of france and others inviting them to world unity and peace through a heavenly power he was enabled to promulgate these ideals in the orient kings could not withstand him they endeavored to extinguish his light but served only to increase its intensity and illumination while in prison he stood against the shah of persia and sultan of turkey and promulgated his teachings until he firmly established the banner of truth and the oneness of humankind i was a prisoner with him for forty years until the young turks of the committee of union and progress overthrew the despotism of dethroned him and proclaimed liberty this committee set me free from tyranny and oppression otherwise i should have been in prison until the days of my life were ended

28741 anytime you cut workers pay add on top of that the fact that hes cutting workers pay to the federal minimum wage which is much lower than the california minimum wage we think is anti worker we cant figure out why the governor thinks he should penalize them for the inability to get a budget passed
28742 were going to create up to five million green jobs that will pay well but cant be outsourced by investing in a clean energy future we are going to create 2 million more jobs by investing in our infrastructure by building roads and bridges and levies and locks and dams all of which need heavy machinery all of which need steel all of which will create ripple effects throughout our economy and put people back to work
28743 workers really need to stick together were going to be reaching out to sympathetic organizations throughout the country were reaching out to many different labor unions through organizations like jobs with justice theres a lot of people that we have that are ready to support us on saturday night

28769 like all australian financial services companies our result for the 2008 financial year has been affected by external factors including the global credit crunch volatile equity markets and a succession of severe weather events
28770 this is purely an accounting and timing issue which will reverse as the investments redeem or as credit spreads contract
28771 our businesses are in good shape integration is progressing well and delivering the synergies we targeted our customer base has grown and satisfaction across all brands continues to improve

28780 i thought we had grown up as a society not even brothels would be this brazen to promote their services
28781 some of the other galleries have turned up their noses but weve been told brisbane is not doing anything lively this has more of a melbourne or new york feel
28782 were more laidback where an exhibition is more of an event than just paintings on a wall

28796 even pelosis own california neighbors oppose her efforts to block new drilling far off american coasts
28797 i will not give the administration an excuse for its failure
28798 im not going to be diverted for a political tactic from a course of action that has a big picture view a vision about an energy independent future that reduces our dependence on fossil fuels and focuses on those renewables that are protective of the environment
28799 a solid majority of americans want us to have more drilling for more american made energy and they arent going to take no for an answer
28800 speaker pelosi senators harry reid and barack obama are defying the will of the american people and theyre doing so at their own risk
28801 republicans feel like they have an opening because of the gas price issue to push for domestic drilling but we havent seen any empirical evidence or tangible evidence that its hurting democrats
28802 maybe this fall the issue will develop into a republican advantage but i dont see that were there yet its a battle of messages between the two parties more than an anvil around the necks of democrats
28803 this president is making it impossible for congress to do oversight of the intelligence community
28804 the only effective oversight that can be done is out of the executive branch and this is the fox guarding the chicken coop
28805 we have secret laws governing secret agencies that are engaging in secret spying against americans and theyre using our own tax dollars to do it this isnt keeping us safer its only making all americans suspects in the eyes of the government
28806 issues such as operational coordination and the management of foreign liaison relationships can indeed be complex but in our profession the guiding standard is one of common sense the best solutions are those that get the job done most effectively
28807 intelligence is at its core a practical calling that by definition means a strong voice for those on the front lines those who do the day to day substantive work of intelligence
28808 in the view of so many officials here in beijing these games are not about the world so much as about china and that is the way that they are cast in the media here again and again
28809 the flame has become a symbol of possession of chinas pride and place in the world protests against the relay that occurred overseas were presented in the state media here as the attempt of foreigners to deny the chinese people that place
28810 officials here had a choice to cast matters differently but that would have meant a very different mind set than what currently prevails here in beijing
28811 as a symbol of china arriving among the great nations even though it had already arrived enabling the party to be the hero that brought the olympics to china
28812 symbols are important in china they were supposed to be paragons of manhood young physically fit and so forth
28813 but when they started hitting people it destroyed the image

28815 once they are here the opportunity is easy to understand
28816 they invest in vacation property or a second home then they start spending more personal time here they begin to realize they can work from here bring their skills here and become part of the growth that is happening soon they start spending a majority of their time in costa rica and then look to moving here full time they love it and so do we
28817 i estimate we are in the first 20 percent of the cycle of growth here
28818 if you take other coastal resort areas like hawaii or cancun as a model you find development expands after major hotels are in operation in this region more than a dozen hotel projects have been announced with key flagships like the four seasons in place already with more visitors more people fall in love with the area and want to come here and live
28819 our team consists of the people who developed the four seasons the top service providers in latin america definitely in costa a great costa rican team not a foreign team they know how to work here they have the contacts and the track record theyve already done it
28820 we wanted to build a resort community that would allow our investors to live here year round and totally enjoy the day to day lifestyle at the same time if an owner plans only to vacation here and wants to rent his property out for the rest of the year we wanted to make that easy for them too our goal was to create a community and the amenity set that would inspire anyone who visits this area to want to stay at coco bay estates because of all that it offers
28821 there arent too many places in the world where you can go to the beach go to the rainforest go surfing visit a volcano go atving hiking or play in waterfalls all in the same day and then go home to a community that is comfortable safe and in what we call affordable luxury
28822 we love it our families love it our friends love it and were pretty sure lots of other folks are going to love it as well
28823 the speak out for military kids program provides a venue for military kids to get together and share their experiences
28824 it helps them learn and polish presentation and speaking skills so they can help others understand the challenges faced by military families during a deployment
28825 in the somk program military and non military youth apply and are chosen to be trained to go out into the community to raise awareness of military family issues and foster community support
28826 during program training they acquire knowledge and develop their leadership organizational teamwork and speaking skills while making new friends and having fun
28827 and through the speak out for military kids program they get valuable presentation coaching and build confidence in public speaking so they can be equipped to go out in the community and tell their stories
28828 provides an opportunity for accenture to give back to the community
28829 one percent of americans who say i will support and defend
28830 one of the things we can do is have people understand what military service members and their families go through as part of the military by speaking out and raising awareness
28831 the most important thing about the program is helping others cope with their problems
28832 i like letting other military kids know theres someone out there for them and i like letting the community know what they can do for the family
28833 a military parent can be asked to leave a family behind at any time
28834 effective communication is the key to the speak out for military kids program
28835 communication is what draws the community to us and what draws those of us in the program together to support one another
28836 my daughter kayla 20 attends hendrix college in arkansas and recently received a scholarship contingent on her community service which included speak out for military kids participation
28837 this gives kids a positive outlet for the roller coaster of emotions they must go through during a deployment
28838 the somk program in texas is growing and we hope some day to have a presence in every area of the state
28839 this program is a wonderful way to support and to show appreciating for those military families who sacrifice so much for their country
28840 well if thats true im humbled im delighted to learn of salmans achievement i think its very funny actually its like men boasting about the size of their sexual no such thing as bad publicity
28841 its high time that we celebrate our vibrant independent bookshops ive always admired and shared independent booksellers passion for books and reading and i feel they play a crucial role in local communities i hope that this initiative will encourage people to visit their local bookshops and discover for themselves what makes them so special

28846 yeah you damn right she did and it felt good too
28847 i think the lease is a bad idea the numbers theyre predicting theyll get from the lease are too high and ive got a major problem with giving one of our major assets to a foreign country maybe our governor better take another look at what hes doing
28848 but as gov rendell has expressed it needs to be determined if leasing the turnpike will produce significantly more funds to finance the needed improvements to our transportation infrastructure and i can only consider the idea of a lease if that is proven to be the case
28849 but they also want more toll roads so theyre dealing with two conflicting priorities
28850 theyre going to do a quick but thorough study of the application
28851 i dont think it can qualify there was no impact study no diversion study im not discouraged after talking to them
28852 im worried that a amp rs degree of aggression and incompetence will infiltrate borders management

28863 the president made very clear that he would use this 45 day period to assess the dprks north koreas cooperation including on reaching agreement on a verification protocol and respond accordingly
28864 a little more than 10 days left before the first opportunity for the president to open that window and de list the north

28877 im not surprised theyre doing this this thing was wildly popular for whatever reason this incarnation of their version has just resonated with people and scrabble just hasnt im not surprised theyre back at it again with a different name and a slightly different experience hoping they can still tap into that zeitgeist going forward

28880 were encouraged that the developers of scrabulous are continuing to build new and innovative games for users
28881 one of the things thats important with all of the new innovation from third parties on facebook platform is that as part of the developer terms of service developers own the intellectual property for the applications they build and attest that their applications do not infringe on any copyright or trademark laws we recommend application developers consult with an attorney who can give sound legal advice whenever they have questions
28882 the scrabulous game was an interesting take on an established and well known game for many reasons the new game was popular because of the old game which had the same rules very similar name and other indications making people think that new game was sanctioned it was not and we know the consequences
28883 blogger compensation costs were exceeding allocated budgets and needed a breather before major restructuring from now all on each weblogs inc blog will have its own budget and run as a semi independent business

28897 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
28898 theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
28899 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name
28900 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies
28901 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
28902 we think the tenor of his campaign is unlikely to change that is what he is offering voters increasingly harsh character attacks personal attacks while people are out there struggling every day
28903 i think voters did expect different from john mccain it is clear what they are going to be offering the american people over the next 96 days selling voters short
28904 if you came out here with us youd see that we have supportive crowds who really ask us about the issues
28905 i need to come by to get my lockbox and my sign

28913 we commend our industry partners like xantrex for making this city tour a reality
28914 industry partners are necessary because solar energy is complex there are key concepts like interconnection standards net metering and others that national state and local officials need to understand in order to make the right decisions about solar for their communities we are simply bringing the knowledge to them as an industry so cities can deploy cost effective solar energy when and where it makes sense to them

28930 violence is down to its lowest level since the spring of 2004
28931 there now appears to be a degree of durability to the gains we have made
28932 because of these operations extremists who once terrorized the citizens of these communities have been driven from their strongholds
28933 was able to walk the streets of sadr city last wednesday
28934 this operation is iraqi led our forces are playing a supporting role
28935 the iraqis will continue taking the lead in more military operations across the country
28936 beginning tomorrow troops deploying to iraq will serve 12 month tours instead of 15 month tours
28937 this will ease the burden on our forces it will make life easier for our wonderful military families
28938 al qaida is on the run in iraq but the terrorists remain dangerous and they are determined to strike our country and our allies again
28939 in this time of war america is grateful to all the men and women who have stepped up forward to defend us
28940 but the key for life on mars is to have a sustained long term presence of water in its liquid form
28941 maybe tomorrow we will have to turn off the life support and just take him home
28942 why isnt the government doing anything to reinforce public order and citizens safety
28943 romania does not approve i repeat does not approve in part or in large part of measures taken by the italian government
28944 we understand part of the measures taken by the italian government but we cannot agree with treatment going beyond the norms of the european union
28945 we recognise that we have an unresolved problem at home that of the roma minority we propose to the italian government to collaborate to resolve this problem
28946 the combination will create an industry leading electronic components company with a strong presence across customer sectors and regions
28947 we are pleased to have reached an important milestone on the road to a promising joint future
28948 my personal opinion is they shouldnt have stopped at griffey they should have had a fire sale dunn arroyo encarnacion
28949 the season is already over with so they need to go to next year this frees up a lot of money for next year you needed to do something
28950 i still wanted to see griffey retire as a red
28951 cincinnati management is a bunch of morons they showed griffey in a white sox cap and i was appalled
28952 they got two players who wont add up to what griffey is
28953 right now these players look like crap on paper but you dont know what youre getting yet
28954 i dont know theyre still my team they made a foolish mistake
28955 its right and proper that those brave men who lost their lives at fromelles are buried with the honour and dignity befitting their ultimate sacrifice
28956 the new cemetery will be a lasting tribute to their bravery and a place of pilgrimage for families who lost a relative in the battle it will ensure the memory of their actions lives on for future generations
28957 ive been to the site and theyre not at peace
28958 i hope each of them is recovered and given the dignity of an individual reburial at a new pheasant wood cemetery
28959 the crime has signs of premeditation mohamed ali called cara to his apartment put the music on high volume and killed her with knife blows he then took her body to the bathroom and then he went off to a party it said
28960 it was only the following day he dismembered the girls body he took various photos of the chopped up body with his cellphones camera including photos like those of the taliban where the decapitated head is placed on top of the body it said
28961 look hes doing well and i have done well in the past
28962 this year was hard i guess with the start of the year but nevertheless i still think its been a good year i just hope i can show it now at the olympics and the u s open
28963 im looking forward for the next two tournaments those are really the ones that can make this season from a good one to a great one again
28964 i already played against him six times and it was always close so i knew that im going to have a chance today
28965 the ban imposed by fifa is illegal and eff will take its case to the international court of arbitration for sport
28966 its going to come down to the little things like squares and circles and double triple and so on
28967 what theyve done is taking a step in the right direction but i dont think its a big enough step
28968 will evaluate every situation individually and take actions as appropriate
28969 what we hear from our customers is that they really want the iphone not just because its a cool device but they want to do stuff with it and i dont think thats been catered for in the market so far
28970 we heard pretty loud and clear from customers that they want data one gigabyte per month is fair but its not generous we want customers who scoff at one gigabyte to have the option to get more
28971 its odd that wireless broadband pricing seems to be different to mobile data pricing and so were shooting to rectify that
28972 i think as customers become more savvy they will start to realise that data over a network is just data over a network regardless of the device used
28973 nearly 14 percent of the pregnant women in wisconsin smoke compared to the national average of 10 percent
28974 that puts wisconsin at number 18 in the overall u s ranking
28975 according to new tobacco treatment guidelines released this spring by the u s public health service counseling can increase a smokers chance of quitting by as much as four times versus trying it alone
28976 pregnant women who smoke not only compromise their own health but that of their baby
28977 cigarette smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of complications premature delivery low birth weight infants and still birth
28978 we are hoping that with the quit line coaching extending past the birth of their babies more women will remain tobacco free
28979 nursing mothers who smoke pass on nicotine to their babies through breast milk
28980 plus secondhand smoke has been linked to sudden infant death syndrome
28981 the impact for us obviously is we cant sail out or into the harbour while that ship is there ms evans told aap
28982 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
28983 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
28984 and how many mericans do you have on your committee
28985 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington
28986 this is because of the hugely negative impact the changes will have on these schools
28987 the teachers know whats going to happen the government only have to look at other states to see how its going to impact
28988 this is a tax on city of milwaukee residents and will increase the cost of registering their vehicles from 75 per car to 95 per car a 26 percent increase for every vehicle in a household

28990 he preached much to them who believed in the grace of god
28991 we have only heard that there was an holy ghost
28992 jesus is the messiah for whom john came to prepare the way and as you have em braced johns doctrine you ought now publicly to acknowledge that redeemer by baptism in his name
28993 in the dwelling house of one of the great men
28994 and he taught daily before the court and the governors
28995 for the contagion of this superstition has not only spread through cities but also through villages and country places
28996 ecclesiastical center for the entire region as indeed it remained for a very long period
28997 they lock you into long term contracts and then they allow all these charges to be put on your bill we have to make sure that consumers are protected
28998 i dont know of any state that has gone to this extent
28999 a consistent uniform national framework of standards is the best case scenario for consumers and for the industry to serve consumers
29000 if you allow 50 states to regulate and legislate in 50 different ways you can create a very confusing and obviously inefficient service
29001 sprint did no damage analysis that considered the lost revenue from contracts the avoidable costs and sprints expected lost profits from contract terminations
29002 the unregulated corners of our economy did much to contribute to the meltdown in our housing market and the accompanying spillover to our financial markets
29003 what do i care if the broker gets paid a commission by the lender its not coming out of my pocket
29004 i knew a guy who made 50 000 one month off excessive fees and went out and bought a mercedes
29005 minorities get taken advantage of a lot more than caucasians
29006 unfortunately ive seen the good and bad in this business especially with foreigners who come here and get taken if the broker and the homebuyer are the same nationality its worse
29007 i once saw an indian broker take an indian customer for seven points on a loan
29008 if you can only have energy when the sun is shining youre in deep trouble and thats why in my opinion photovoltaics havent penetrated the market
29009 if i could provide a storage mechanism then i make energy 24 7 and then we can start talking about solar
29010 i can turn sunlight into a chemical fuel now i can use photovoltaics at night
29011 opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
29012 on the oxygen side it doesnt work well and you have to put way more energy in than needed to get the oxygen out
29013 its cheap its efficient its highly manufacturable its incredibly tolerant of impurity and its from earth abundant stuff
29014 i hereby assert my right to request that you halt any further communication with me
29015 to find links to certain member counties as well as cities and other development agencies near you
29016 theres a government mandate to create 30 000 affordable homes which makes for an even stronger market
29017 its not a credit score program its based on dti
29018 the good thing about this program is that you can literally get 100 financing with a 550 credit score
29019 the 3 down payment can come from a gift and it doesnt have to be seasoned
29020 its one of the few programs that are quick in the federal government
29021 because its hard to find comps comparable sales or to find people to do the work
29022 the race factor will be doubly bad an obama powell ticket will hurt obamas chances of beating mccain
29023 this is a tax on city of milwaukee residents and will increase the cost of registering their vehicles from 75 per car to 95 per car a 26 percent increase for every vehicle in a household
29024 i do not want milwaukee to become a tax island
29025 thats what i look at every day thats what i consider to be our paradise back there
29026 it goes back to the safety of the entire city and the stability of
29027 we are working very hard to minimize the impact to the landowners
29028 its just a question of whether private property is required to protect the levees and whether they have a right to use that private property
29029 in southeast louisiana there is no more paramount purpose than flood protection a lesson painfully inculcated and never to be forgotten
29030 this is a tax on city of milwaukee residents and will increase the cost of registering their vehicles from 75 per car to 95 per car a 26 percent increase for every vehicle in a household

29051 when the facts change i change my mind what do you do sir
29052 recent reports of the budget deficit are troubling not because of the size of the deficit indeed we had proportionally larger deficits in the eighties and nineties but because talk of the deficit threatens to limit the measures congress and the president are willing to take to turn this economy around

29054 i regret that it now appears bocog has announced that there will be limitations on website access during games time
29055 i also now understand that some ioc officials negotiated with the chinese that some sensitive sites would be blocked on the basis they were not considered games related
29056 it is necessary for all olympians to be able to learn about the real situation in china and to point out human rights violations freely whenever and wherever in line with their conscience
29057 financial regulation needs to be extended to cover a much wider range of institutions basically the financial framework created in the 1930s which brought generations of relative stability needs to be updated to 21st century conditions if the government is going to stand behind financial institutions those institutions had better be carefully regulated because otherwise the game of heads i win tails you lose will be played more furiously than ever at taxpayers expense
29058 proponents of expanded regulation no matter how compelling their arguments will have to contend with very well financed opposition from the financial industry and as upton sinclair pointed out its hard to get a man to understand something when his salary or we might add his campaign war chest depends on his not understanding it

29060 we dont mind john mccain going after us if he sticks to the facts
29061 but we are sick of the distortions about our record
29062 both of us strongly favor off shore drilling to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
29063 they both have pasty white faces and totally creepy smiles

29078 even if oil went down to 110 or 100 a barrel the airlines have a tremendous amount of costs that they have to recoup
29079 this increase is in response to the high price of fuel and matches the increases set by some of our competitors
29080 we are fairly bullish on what we see for september through december after we get past the summer
29081 what we need is the average fare paid to go up
29082 many people are asking with oil now in the 120s and not in the 140s when are we going to see air fares come down
29083 rim is a competitor and has done a reasonable job in a space that is traditionally ours so its no great surprise that we see this as an opportunity to give consumers a proper choice on what e mail solutions they want

29111 weve had process servers court officials very experienced people in serving documents of this nature on people trying to track him down
29112 the process servers went to sydney airport to see if that was the case but after spending most of the day there there was no sight of khoder
29113 we knew he was staying at the hotel ibis before the fight but he refused to come downstairs and with privacy laws the hotel quite rightly wouldnt say what room he was in
29114 the process servers had been at the hotel in the foyer for some period of time hoping hed come out
29115 they saw people came in and out of his room but no sign of khoder
29116 we hoped to get him at the fight and he didnt turn up to that
29117 to me personally it was quite a surprise that he didnt front
29118 i dont know any other fights that he hasnt attended but without having been able to contact the man to find out what he was up to we can only speculate
29119 its very frustrating were only trying to get to the bottom of whats going on here with williams sudden departure from the club
29120 ultimately well find these things out but this just puts another hurdle in our way
29121 if the court is satisfied that hes just taking evasive action to avoid coming to court to avoid they can make alternative methods such as allowing us to serve on an address known to be the address of khoder or on someone known to be close to him

29164 when news of the takedown notice spread protest groups with tens of thousands of members sprung up on facebook asking hasbro to rethink its decision

29183 as far as this administration is concerned the best oversight is no oversight

29198 barack obama has finally pulled the race card against john mccain and the republicans
29199 you know mr i transcend politics has finally tacitly admitted he is just a typical politician by accusing those who dont like him of being racist
29200 is it arrogant or above obamas station for him to meet with the chairman of the federal reserve if im not mistaken he is a sitting united states senator and also the presidential candidate of the democratic party such meetings are actually the norm
29201 will think twice before deciding such a high profile case
29202 this is a weapon for villagers like us which an army cant defeat
29203 they taught us how to tie ourselves to a tree and blind soldiers with mirrors
29204 i then show them a documentary of bilin and i pause at the different strategies we have like stuffing ourselves in barrels and rolling in front of bulldozers
29205 people are now unemployed their sons are leaving university because they cant afford tuition
29206 now i tell the protesters take a camera take a camera
29207 i am under a virtual house arrest and have been directed by the police personnel not to move out without seeking their permission
29208 i am ruined but have no qualms with anybody i was destined to lose my life partner at this age what aggrieves me is the trail of miseries that have been inflicted upon my parents family my three brothers have been jailed for none of their faults
29209 a large contingent of police and paramilitary troopers raided their house at the twilight on that fateful day at daulatpora in chadoora and arrested my three sons tasveer irfan and ishfaq what was their sin

29211 theyre more pro life than their parents but theyre anti religious right
29212 we are belief making machines we would invent religion within a month if it did not exist it explains meaning and the meaning of life how do we want to deal with sorrow and hurt the stories of religion play a very important social function there is no question to me that the our brains are built to generate these ideas for social purposes
29213 brain imaging allows you to study moral beliefs you can now ask the question what is the neurobiology of morality indeed is there a detectable brain mechanism or are the rules of morality learned so many of our moral beliefs seem to be a function of built in mechanisms in our brain
29214 what is interesting about this is how it confirms some biblical ideas including man is designed to believe in god
29215 we were excited we told our friends and family the good news did whatever little things we could to prepare ourselves to be parents
29216 to finally be matched up with someone and to think we found this person it was just tough
29217 i feel really really sad for her to think whats going on in her life to do something this terrible to someone else
29218 im also pretty angry and i want to make sure she gets whatever punishment she has coming to her she certainly deserves it
29219 it doesnt get much lower than that ive got to say
29220 its a little bit of egg on the face i guess for all of us concerned
29221 these are excellent requirements to protect and preserve the natural environment that were all working so hard to maintain and improve in the naples bay area
29222 im surprised the neighbors didnt see me wailing like a crazy person in the street i was heartbroken
29223 theyre even watching their children closer because if they did it to four cats whos to say they wouldnt do it to a child

29237 were deeply sorry for the loss i just want to tell the news to please let both rest in peace
29238 he was a good man with a good heart im shocked
29239 the dept of corrections has decided typewriters are a luxury inmates can do without for access to the courts

29248 ships aircraft and industrial equipment burn huge quantities of fossil fuel and cause massive greenhouse gas pollution yet president george w bush stalls with one bureaucratic dodge after another
29249 because bushs environmental protection agency continues to wantonly ignore its duty to regulate pollution california is forced to seek judicial action
29250 im using cheap earth abundant materials that you can mass manufacture as long as you can charge the surface you can create the catalyst and it doesnt get any cheaper than that
29251 you cant think about an energy economy or a global energy system only when the sun is out
29252 you could imagine during the day you have a photovoltaic cell you take some of that electricity and use it in your house then take the other part of that electricity for my catalyst feed the catalyst water and you get hydrogen and oxygen
29253 so ive made your house a gas station and a power station its all enabled because we can use light plus water to make a chemical fuel which is hydrogen and oxygen
29254 in the next 50 years the world needs 16 terawatts by the end of the century well need around 30
29255 theres a heck of lot of energy stored in chemical bonds
29256 when it comes to the war on the poor youre either with the poor or against them
29257 if 5 gallon gasoline isnt an emergency i have to ask what is an emergency
29258 if we can increase our ability to produce energy we can control the building of the bridge to the long term future when we are no longer as dependent on fossil fuels as we are now
29259 if we want to get to renewables we have to build a bridge to get there
29260 i think it helps to have a craftsperson on the board of trustees
29261 this shows our claims on emissions are simply a big lie
29262 the government has known about this for a very long time but has just refused to face up to it
29263 there is no way the government can hope to achieve any of its emissions targets without cheating unless it changes its policies on encouraging flying and hoping to satisfy peoples insatiable demands for buying more and more stuff
29264 it cant be absolutely precise but it is a best estimate of where we are it is very much in line with other studies on the subject so we are fairly confident of it it is very interesting background information
29265 would not want to be held to an international target on it
29266 holding china and india responsible for emissions from manufactured goods they sell to us is going to prove very hard to negotiate
29267 it would be much easier to base any future deal on emissions at the point of consumption that feeds into the equity debate in which poor countries will be allowed to increase their co2
29268 its at the very least misleading for the uk government to claim reductions while we export our emissions this is a problem no government wants to face
29269 in emissions terms we are constantly battling against increases of wealth every year we dont even manage to improve our energy efficiency to keep up with wealth increases let alone to cut emissions
29270 theres a very fundamental problem here that no one really wants to talk about
29271 australia has already squandered 12 years due to the denial of the howard government

29285 from the perspective of john q public whos wondering what can i do to reduce emissions saying certain activities count and others dont doesnt pass the laugh test
29286 and we need credibility with the public on this issue
29287 the environment kind of got more important as we went along
29288 its hard to be preachy when you eat a lot at subway and burgerville
29289 but i think its important to be aware of the consumer culture and not just go along with what its dictating i think oregon is really ripe for that
29290 we got rid of cronyism kick backs and sweetheart deals
29291 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon
29292 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
29293 it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
29294 the findings of this assessment suggest the need for immediate action to buttress efforts to protect health from current climate hazards
29295 but have not been as successful adapting to extreme heat
29296 climate change could tip the ecological balance and trigger outbreaks of disease previously rare or unknown in canada
29297 this report makes it clear that if you have bad health outcomes now youre likely to be more impacted by extreme weather events than if youre at the top of the health ladder
29298 the findings of this assessment suggest the need for immediate action to buttress efforts to protect health from current climate hazards
29299 this report makes it clear that if you have bad health outcomes now youre likely to be more impacted by extreme weather events than if youre at the top of the health ladder

29302 what the ballpark does is heal that cut between the warehouse district and the north loop
29303 what we are going to do is improve a land

29316 ieder bad heeft een ander reglement ze bepalen zelf wat ze toestaan als het gaat om zwemkleding
29317 ik kan daar absoluut in komen het dragen van een onderbroek in het zwembad is niet hygi nisch
29318 zwembaden hebben groot gelijk dat ze proberen om hier een stokje voor te steken
29319 voor de hygi ne in zwembaden is het funest als mensen erin stappen met een onderbroek die ze al de hele dag hebben gedragen
29320 we hebben in een afgesloten doucheruimte allerlei tests gedaan om te bekijken hoeveel vuiligheid mensen meenemen naar het zwembad
29321 we vingen het afvoerwater op en hebben dat geanalyseerd gebleken is dat de verschillen enorm zijn de meest vieze bezoeker bracht twintig keer meer vuiligheid met zich mee dan de meest schone
29322 douchen helpt maar je kunt ook denken aan verplichte badmutsen of verplicht naakt douchen voordat mensen hun zwemkleding aantrekken en een duik nemen

29328 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
29329 race will not have any role in my campaign nor is there any place for it im disappointed that hes used it
29330 run negative ads on me continuously and i might point out for the record that his was the first
29331 youd think wed be having a serious debate but so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton and britney spears i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can come up with
29332 our politics is small when we need to be thinking big
29333 i admire his obamas campaign but what we are talking about here is substance and not style and what were talking about is who has an agenda for the future of america campaigns are tough but i am proud of the campaign that we have run
29334 yesterday he suggested that we put air in our tires to save on gas my friends lets do that but do you think thats enough to break our dependence on middle eastern oil i dont think so
29335 the mccain campaign has very clearly decided that the only way to win this election is to become very personal and very negative we believe that people will see that as nothing more than the same old politics and the same old policies of the last eight years
29336 paul has incorporated his natural gift of laughter his wonderful personality and his need to make a difference in the world and has become an uplifting speaker as a certified laughter leader he left all who attended in awe laughter and appreciation
29337 if he runs poorly this race theyre going to throw everything at him hes off steroids he has been running against weak horses anything you can imagine will be thrown in his direction and its unfortunate
29338 ill put it this way if he didnt run that way in the belmont stakes id come into this race saying hes going to run the best race of his life

29592 its something we need to wake up to here just because we have it doesnt mean were going to be able to sell it
29593 the main challenges that face barrick and i think i may as well speak for the industry at large are the cost factors
29594 we still believe that the canadian economy will avoid an outright recession but it could be on the edge

29604 i was thrilled to have the opportunity to work with this program and the amazing group of artists i led
29605 it was wonderful to see how the foundations of each previous lesson build up the students interest and ability as the weeks progressed
29606 you got up early in the morning and cleaned house and there was a doctor and his wife
29607 they had a little girl i had to feed her and be very quiet so i didn t wake up the doctor s wife and give her breakfast and then when it was time for me to go to school i d knock on her door and the little girl would go into her room and then when i came home if i was more than five minutes late i was reprimanded and then every night i would have to clean thoroughly a different room and then when i was all done with my work then i could do my homework
29608 just about the time we thought we ve about seen it all and it just wasn t as interesting anymore and then i was hit with cancer
29609 so we thought well we sure did that in time
29610 the federal government is going to have to put more into the states that support it in the next couple of years before we have what will be a national crisis
29611 i dont have to tell state officials the areas that were obviously going to have to cut there going to be the areas where we spend a lot of money in our educational system which we desperately need as an investment for our future in our health care facility when we have so many people sick in this country
29612 shes still mad ill wait until she signals things are okay
29613 im not mad i wish hed reach out hes so stubborn and hes not very affectionate that makes me mad again

29616 steve newton started the law enforcement equipment program as a way to provide used gear for american armed forces units to use in training or equipping friendly foreign police forces the program accepts donations of used equipment from u s law enforcement departments and helps get it overseas
29617 we simply act as a go between for the american law enforcement community and the military
29618 this may be the most severe economic downturn since the depression
29619 i dont know everything cuomo did i know he was trying governor pataki was trying governor spitzer was trying
29620 the candidate that would help john mccain win new york would probably be a resurrection
29621 i had an 18 footer for par that broke six feet the last two feet it went sideways almost stopped then trickled in
29622 that was big because even though it was early in the round it really kept my momentum going
29623 i maybe hit it a little better in canada and it was one more birdie and no bogeys
29624 i came back from there and i was still playing well no top 10s but still good showings
29625 the swing got a little out of kilter but i got it back on track and felt good going in to today
29626 all in all i did everything i was supposed to im not used to holing 25 foot putts so when i make those its an extra bonus for me
29627 it was nice to go bogey free i havent done that in a while
29628 it may be an advantage to have played early as the wind is picking up and some footprints on the greens could make it tricky later today
29629 i hit a solid tee shot but it bounced left and i was lucky to be in bounds
29630 i got a good break and turned it into a par almost made birdie you sure dont want to give one back on that hole particularly when you have a good round going
29631 im feeling pretty confident with the putter this week which is huge out here
29632 i wasnt too happy with the way i hit it today but putting makes up for a lot i guess im putting well because im hitting it closer
29633 i had an 18 footer for par that broke six feet the last two feet it went sideways almost stopped then trickled in
29634 that was big because even though it was early in the round it really kept my momentum going
29635 i maybe hit it a little better in canada and it was one more birdie and no bogeys
29636 i came back from there and i was still playing well no top 10s but still good showings
29637 the swing got a little out of kilter but i got it back on track and felt good going in to today
29638 all in all i did everything i was supposed to im not used to holing 25 foot putts so when i make those its an extra bonus for me
29639 it was nice to go bogey free i havent done that in a while
29640 it may be an advantage to have played early as the wind is picking up and some footprints on the greens could make it tricky later today
29641 i hit a solid tee shot but it bounced left and i was lucky to be in bounds
29642 i got a good break and turned it into a par almost made birdie you sure dont want to give one back on that hole particularly when you have a good round going
29643 im feeling pretty confident with the putter this week which is huge out here
29644 i wasnt too happy with the way i hit it today but putting makes up for a lot i guess im putting well because im hitting it closer
29645 youre not going to make this team that way youre not exactly freaking dick butkus out there
29646 i dont feel him in a way that i feel i have to call ghostbusters but ive been haunted by elvis in the sense that when i knew him he was very sweet but also seriously into drugs
29647 ive been haunted by wishing he could have lived longer because im from memphis and ive had the fame thing too
29648 the college is particularly concerned that such surgery may exploit vulnerable women
29649 we feel these operations might prey on people with insecurities and fears who actually need psychological help
29650 they are also not very anatomically based and have the potential to cause serious harm
29651 in one case we heard of a man bringing in a brazilian pornographic photo and saying make my girlfriend look like this
29652 we dont think it is ethical behaviour to agree to do that
29653 it is often not clear where the g spot is or if it even exists at all in some women
29654 so the procedure is done without that being verified often causing problems in sex
29655 but that ad diminishes him and makes him look silly
29656 the theme of the gala will focus on celebrating diversity and promoting cultural awareness
29657 surrogates and high profile supporters have their place in the campaign
29658 they can help draw crowds raise money and communicate enthusiasm for the campaign like every other asset they need to be leveraged carefully
29659 celebrities are coming onboard because theyre excited about obama like the rest of america
29660 anyone who knows and listens to barack obama doesnt think hes empty headed
29661 i do my own math and i know at the end of the day whats at risk i dont call it a roll of the dice i call it a calculated risk
29662 i dont want to have to worry about how the pre sales are going i want to make the movie
29663 it had been around and some companies had tried to make it but interest had waned
29664 are you a participant or are you an observer thats what i liked in the story
29665 they want to raise it on your name but youre not actually benefiting from that
29666 so i looked to my wife and said why dont we just do this
29667 i dont make art that i can put on my refrigerator
29668 i want to make good movies that could potentially be a hit
29669 the ordering of attitudes and dispositions in the soul is dysfunctional if at or near the center of these there is no deep gratitude by which i mean gratitude that this world exists and that one lives in it
29670 they leave huge destruction in their wake and they are not a wild herd
29671 we could protect the crops somehow we could reimburse the farmers that have crop damage and call it a day
29672 i think the data at this stage in the united states are not suggesting recession
29673 were right on the brink and i would be more surprised if we didnt have a recession than if we did given the financial state
29674 at this stage i think they are the major reason why in the very short term were fending off inflationary pressures
29675 that is a fiscal policy operation essentially something that should have been set up in the treasury department
29676 what we should not do is have the central bank involved in its balance sheet
29677 that balance sheet is the creator of the monetary base and if you allow major fluctuations in that base as a result of other than monetary policy reasons i think youre taking undue risks with the notion of the stability of the financial system and very specifically the feds control of inflation
29678 the race card on thursday citing his remarks that republicans would try to scare voters by pointing out he
29679 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck rick davis mr
29680 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me mr
29681 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
29682 we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
29683 i agree with it and im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
29684 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues hell continue to talk about
29685 we know what kind of campaign they are going to run
29686 mitigate the effects of the advertising downturn and to manage its balance sheet conservatively and these are key factors in moodys affirmation of the existing ratings
29687 theres carnage in the newsrooms overseas particularly in the states where some five thousand people have lost their jobs this year alone
29688 theres also been a massive reduction in reporting on foreign news and certain categories of news
29689 cost cutting alone is not a good enough strategy while locally we are seeing investigative journalism taking a back seat in the us cost cutting is not affecting investigative journalism which is seen as a unique benefit instead certain categories of jobs are being cut were seeing photographers and subs leaving newsrooms while more shrewd newspapers are reinvesting the wall street journal is investing in online subs online video and other web skills
29690 this will allow us to continue our transition to new media while further controlling the rapidly rising costs of newsprint and transportation both of which have increased more than 30 percent in the past year
29691 this decision to move to a five day print newspaper was a difficult one for me and for our colleagues at the new york times co but we believe it is a necessary one and not unlike changes that all newspapers and media companies are currently experiencing
29692 to continue to be the primary source of news and information for all of davidson county
29693 voltear la p gina en el tema de los secuestrados
29694 if some buyers consider assets are worth more to them than they are to us then we dont rule that out
29695 i accept that the rights issue was a very tough process
29696 we have pursued a strategy of supporting the housing market attracting a greater proportion of house purchase applications than the market average and consequently reducing the remortgage proportion of our total lending compared to the market
29697 the continued effect of the 2007 financial markets dislocation has contributed directly to a lower supply of mortgage funding and therefore a smaller market and to increased competition for deposits in mortgages our share of new lending was unchanged from the first half of 2007 which after all allowing for the smaller markets and repayments resulted in a reduced level of net lending
29698 the economic outlook is clearly challenging with rising fuel and utility prices increasing affordability stretch the reduced supply of mortgage finance and generally less benign prospects for the economy are continuing to contribute to lower levels of housing transactions and falling house prices in this environment we will continue to favour profitable mortgage lending over market share and will maintain our cautious approach to growth in credit cards and unsecured personal loans
29699 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
29700 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
29701 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
29702 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic
29703 this particular incident as horrific as it is is obviously extremely rare
29704 this really is the last chance for households to avoid the energy price rises
29705 consumers have to act within the next few days by switching to a capped tariff today we predict this could save a typical home 300 400 over the next year
29706 those type of kids should be in a school of their own
29707 all quotes attributed to me on imao are made up including this one
29708 in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and he did despair for in his omniscience he did know that his creations had but three fifths of the splendor of that which would be imao
29709 i dont want to see my sister hurt i hate to see her cry im only crying because she is crying
29710 theyre marketing their services to not only foreign governments but to fortune 500 corporations
29711 this is a company that has been accused of murdering iraqi civilians
29712 of shooting the bodyguard to the iraqi vice president of causing blowback attacks on united states troops of hurting the morale of the united states military that has cost united states taxpayers over a billion dollars for its operations in iraq
29713 when i woke up the canadians came and gave us some treatment after that i collected some of the pieces of the children my wife was crying she was in a very bad way
29714 congress change the rules talk to us on our social networks http letourcongresstweet org let our congress tweet loct08
29715 there are some people with government portfolios who are supporting us because they are worried about their own security
29716 they inform us of the movements of u s and nato troops there have even been some instances where they have assisted us in carrying out attacks
29717 blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted
29718 i dont mind being punished for something i did not for something i didnt do
29719 alternative teaching methods as used in a dc public high school classroom
29720 weve taken this action as a prudent response to the current extraordinary market conditions that have resulted in higher than usual redemptions in the fund not matched by fresh investment
29721 although id kill my husband if he were home every day
29722 we overestimate what we could accomplish in short periods of time and we underestimate what we could accomplish over long periods of time
29723 can i and will i be motivated to duplicate this life for the next 5 or 10 years or longer
29724 as fast as possible in the least amount of time
29725 a for a n o deve ser usada nem para o mal durante as batalhas e nem para mal nenhum
29726 it could so easily have been a very different result
29727 the group tried to evacuate but only half the party got across the river
29728 they set off their emergency beacon and managed to walk a couple of kilometres to the road and raise the alarm
29729 they were cold and wet and we were concerned about hypothermia
29730 not seem to be a wise decision to have gone there in the first place
29731 we got smacked heaps we could not get out and i blanked out
29732 i heard a crack and the whole tree tipped over
29733 there was a lot of heat complaints from texas to the point of beyond what it had been seven or eight years ago
29734 we want to try and move it back so it is cooler and we know it cant work for everyone because it may be too cold up north to have the event in october
29735 there has been no dialogue they just shove papers across the table
29736 i personally find it hard to believe they would strike with that kind of money on the table
29737 i think we have a reasonable proposal on the table
29738 i dont think ive ever really done anything really scary
29739 its about putting myself into a situation thats so uncomfortable and so scary that if i can do that i can do anything
29740 i just had this flash like oh my god how cool would that be to go on a journey of doing something scary every single day for 30 days with things that got harder and harder and harder i thought how would that motivate me and change me
29741 you know what dad im not afraid of anything except going downhill on my bike and im working on that
29742 definitely being buried alive full stop end of story because it goes against every single survival instinct i have
29743 you might see that once every 50 years at that sustained speed
29744 theres probably more damage in some areas that we are simply unaware of
29745 its another very important test obviously when you lose a couple its puts an extra emphasis on this particular test and i think thats pretty obvious
29746 that puts a bit of an extra edge on it a bit of extra stress id imagine
29747 so its very important test theres always a lot of tension in every test you are involved in particularly the big ones australia south africa and a number of others so theres always a lot of tension around a test match and thats the way it should be
29748 oh for sure its a big game for the bledisloe cup and the tri nations dead right
29749 we have put our bets foot forward this week the guys have trained well and they are very focused they have been very focused right through the six test matches we have played this year i couldnt ask any more of them
29750 as a group they are really trying to do the business whether we are good enough we cant do any more than we are doing
29751 we are building as a team hopefully we have built enough to have a very good performance at the weekend
29752 my logging guys are coming out today to see what we can do its just devastating but all we can do is take one day at a time
29753 ive never experienced anything like what happened the noise of the wind was just horrendous
29754 its an absolute mess but i havent yet been able to get in to have a proper look
29755 we tried to get up to the area to have a look around but the roads are blocked but id say theres definitely significant damage the main priority is the get the roads open
29756 we want to set the record straight and explain to the public that we consider there is a very small chance of tests finding mercury at non complying levels
29757 the council has agreed to do further sampling to remove any uncertainty about the soil being safe for the public and to protect the environment
29758 so homology and cohomology theories rule the day not as powerful as homology groups but infinitely more tractable
29759 its always good fun playing against quality opposition and hes exactly that i think hes about the same age has similar skills and its always a good rivalry coming up against him
29760 they did score one try when dan carter bumped me so that was something i was pretty disappointed about from a personal point of view
29761 obviously theres a lot of disappointment in the way were playing but this is what brings a team together this is where you get tight really dig in and want to do well
29762 theres some positives in the guys getting tight alongside one another
29763 the tri nations is up for grabs the bledisloe a couple of trophies that mean a lot to us were wanting to get this campaign back on track
29764 we werent playing the right end of the field and at times we were creating line breaks and it was bit disappointing we couldnt finish those off there were some good signs but weve got to finish off so i guess were looking to play a bit of a different game this week
29765 if we play better as a team it doesnt matter about any individual brilliance its a team game and we all need be on the same page if we improve as a team well be a lot better
29766 hes a world class player and hes just so awesome at those breakdowns where we lacked a little bit at the weekend but hes not going to come in and turn things round individually we have to step up our game as a team not be as soft as we were and get stuck in
29767 when times are tough you need your experienced players to step up so well be looking to do that
29768 the more precisely the position is determined the less precisely the momentum is known in this instant and vice versa
29769 refers to talk from previous conference assuming everyone had been there
29770 i bet you can think of ways that each of them could improve their presentation
29771 young man it would be better if you didnt say anything at all your talk was awful
29772 the poor guy was crushed obviously and his adviser livid and yet i feel sure that saunders meant no malice i think he honestly meant to be helpful and a day or two later he was seen talking privately at greater length with the student i think the student felt better as a result i even think something similar happened to mac lane when he was younger and mac lane felt that such frankness was necessary and salutary on occasion
29773 our software is popular throughout europe we have had many requests for a german version of our new updated tmpgenc 4 0 xpress encoder for its additional high definition video and blu ray functionality tmpgenc mpeg editor 3 has also been in demand worldwide we are pleased to offer both of these programs to our german speaking customers
29774 ewww im really disgusted that 25 of the people voted yes im just as disgusted if not more so at the people who think that judgment is needed to define pornography i am strongly against censorship in all its forms
29775 i run xp on four machines and ubuntu on another machine hell will freeze over before i install vista dells customer support may stink to high heaven but their marketing is smart to continue selling xp
29776 i might be naive on this but i cant see a backlash developing in future against local producers consumers grasp this is a global crisis with the skyrocketing price of a global commodity crude oil having a great deal to do with shortages and food price inflation
29777 he is a customer plus my husband did some remodeling work for this guy
29778 well please tell her that she thinks i am just being difficult
29779 i had it on your driver seat right here so that if you didnt have enough it would be right there if you needed more and now it is gone
29780 well she just got the 20 in the mail not 15 minutes ago for her birthday meanwhile my daughter was sobbing
29781 he is middle aged though i didnt trust him enough to believe he wouldnt take the money i knew he did no one else was near my car and my daughter wouldnt lie
29782 the new scofield reference bible holy bible editor c i scofield
29783 for a nation to commit the sin of anti semitism brings inevitable judgment
29784 2 god made an unconditional promise of blessings through abrams seed a to the nation of israel to inherit a specific territory forever
29785 3 there is a promise of blessing upon those individuals and nations who bless abrams descendants and a curse laid upon those who persecute the jews
29786 it has invariably fared ill with the people who have persecuted the jew well with those who have protected him
29787 2 and i will make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shall be a blessing
29788 3 and i will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed
29789 the contrast i know that ye are abrahams seed if ye were abrahams children is that between the natural and the spiritual posterity of abraham the israelitish people and ishmaelitish people are the former all who are of the precious faith with abraham whether jews or gentiles are the latter rom 9 6 8 gal 4 14 see abrahamic covenant gen 15 18 note
29790 8 37 all jews are natural descendants of abraham but are not necessarily his spiritual posterity cp rom 9 6 8 gal 3 6 14
29791 the israelitish people and ishmaelitish people are the natural posterity of abraham
29792 all jews are natural descendants of abraham but are not necessarily his spiritual posterity
29793 2 8 44 that this satanic fatherhood cannot be limited to the pharisees is made clear in 1jn3 8 10
29794 ye are of your father the devil and the lust of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speakest a lie he speakest of his own for he is a liar and the father of it
29795 he that commiteth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the work of the devil
29796 judging christianity by looking at the american evangelists is kind of like judging the british by watching benny hill
29797 this is not a war between jews and arabs it is a war between god and the devil
29798 the line between christians and muslims is the difference between good and evil
29799 were not in the situation that the afl in melbourne is in where clubs are actually getting financial assistance
29800 but if it gets to that point well have to consider that to maintain our saturation coverage across the city
29801 im not a fan of the idea that cutting teams in sydney is the answer
29802 people are quick to say lets cut clubs but theyre not so quick to say which ones culling sydney teams ignores the huge advantage we get with saturation in the most competitive market in the country
29803 apart from the pain it causes for fans it leaves holes for other codes to fill
29804 i dont think perth and adelaide will be ready there wont be the interest by then
29805 weve got quite isolated communities in some of the places that i just named
29806 manly is an example of a community that is actually reasonably isolated there are people who drive over the spit bridge on friday night and have no intention of going back until monday morning
29807 theres a good chance if theres no team playing out of brookvale those people are not going to the footy
29808 penrith the same cronulla the same in melbourne people tend to travel into the city to the grounds with relative ease
29809 the simple fact is that coffs harbour and the sunshine coast dont have the facility or the community to support a football club that needs to be turning over at least 12million a year
29810 we certainly want to do some work to research growth areas and look at where our best returns will come from
29811 if we didnt play that game we would never have known we are good enough to play that way against the best side in the competition and possibly the best side we have seen for a while
29812 to know that we can do that in times of adversity like this we can draw on those moments to give ourselves a bit of belief had we not played that well what are we going to draw on
29813 mick malthouse always says you learn so much about someone in times of adversity
29814 we have got a lot on the line and i certainly have full confidence in my teammates
29815 i have seen it before last year everyone doubted us but we believe we can play good footy and make an impact
29816 we are really looking forward to the challenge of playing hawthorn given what happened last time
29817 our form hasnt been great in the last couple of weeks but we have learnt a lot as a team and learnt a lot about each other since then
29818 we are attracting new monies as well it seems to be the options are getting less and less with collapses within the finance sector
29819 we finally have a team that threatens the all blacks
29820 look no further than luke burgess for years we had a half back who they just didnt see as a threat now we do all those guys need to do is back themselves and enjoy it
29821 there was a fantastic feeling out of that win over the all blacks
29822 i dont know about the scars of the past i wasnt part of it that was my first test against the all blacks but we also know this one in auckland is going to be ferocious and amazing
29823 he talked about being able to focus on your own potential and your own goals and having that clear definite one pointed focus where nothing else stands in your way
29824 wayne actually sent me a happy 7th birthday card through some friends that year i loved the tigers
29825 his pluck he gives and gives and he loves playing
29826 sometimes ive got to tell him to stop rein himself in at training
29827 weve got to keep backing that and mastering the when and where you pull things out
29828 you just cant play conservatively at test level and achieve what wed like
29829 if burgo is threatening the defence theres always more space outside
29830 yeah mummie got that started and phil waugh wont let it go
29831 im not too happy about it i think its because he considers me intelligent and mclovins a hit with the ladies
29832 youd not meet a more genuine guy he energises a team but id advise a chocolate ban at nights because its like hes on a sugar high all the time
29833 robbies brought in that fresh open mind and with luke hes got the most complete young halfback of the past decade
29834 be confident believe and not be too hard on yourself
