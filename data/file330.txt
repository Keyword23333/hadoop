3300218 i recognize that people across the commonwealth particularly retirees on a fixed income are facing difficult economic times
3300219 however i returned an earlier version of this legislation expressing concern about adding significant costs to the commonwealths already large unfunded retirement liability

3300255 de baptisten uit georgi vragen om gebed voor de jongens uit hun gemeenten die opgeroepen zijn om dienst te nemen in het georgische leger
3300256 dat is het enige communicatiemiddel dat nog werkt volgens onze contacten in georgi waren zowel de mobiele netwerken als de internetverbindingen belangrijke doelen van de russische bombardementen om zo het land te isoleren van de rest van de wereld
3300257 uiteraard spreekt men het verlangen uit dat er snel een einde zal komen aan deze oorlog
3300258 daar is op korte termijn geld nodig onder andere voor de aankoop van voedsel en medicijnen
3300259 elke avond proberen de gemeenten samen te komen om te bidden en te vasten voor het behoud van de jongens die opgeroepen zijn om dienst te nemen in het georgische leger
3300260 maandag was er contact met zaal chimchiuri een voorganger in een dorpje op 3 kilometer afstand van de grens met zuid osseti hij vertelde dat ze gehoord hebben dat hun dorp gebombardeerd zal worden de jonge mensen zijn richting tbilisi gevlucht de oudere bevolking is achtergebleven in angstige afwachting van wat er gaat gebeuren
3300261 confesso di aver scritto sempre per me stesso e mai pensando a chi mi avrebbe comprato

3300263 you really should see this shooting stars hundreds of them its amazing
3300264 and were also missing the pleasure of your burrito fueled company
3300265 did you see the perseids last night best show ive ever seen i swear there were a dozen shooting stars in the sky at all times sort of a once in a lifetime experience good thing we were all out here huh
3300266 too bad you couldnt both have had a second helping of bean burritos
3300267 oh you havent seen the new wing two bedrooms and another bath upstairs and up here my gallery
3300268 please ben statues are dead politicians this is sculpture please speak in a reverent tone lest i become violent here are replicas of some of the greatest sculpture this naughty globe has produced
3300269 well that hideous thing ive seen before but when did you acquire the rest of this ballast
3300270 do not listen ma petite chere he is a barbarian and knows no better
3300271 i know how you feel it cant be much longer patience my lovely
3300272 ben you will have to wait while i give you a lesson in how to look at sculpture youve been rude to a lady i dont tolerate that
3300273 huh dont be silly jubal youre rude to ladies live ones a dozen times a day
3300274 you know i wouldnt be rude to the old woman who posed for that
3300275 anne have i ever been rude to you or to any of the girls
3300276 you have never been rude to any of us jubal
3300277 have you ever known me to be rude to a lady
3300278 i have seen you be intentionally rude to a woman i have never seen you be rude to a lady
3300279 one more opinion what do you think of this bronze
3300280 when i first saw it i thought it was horrible but i have come to the conclusion that it may be the most beautiful thing i have ever seen
3300281 huh when i argue with anne that day i turn in my suit but i dont grok it
3300282 attend to me ben anybody can see a pretty girl an artist can look at a pretty girl and see the old woman she will become a better artist can look at an old woman and see the pretty girl she used to be a
3300283 how about this one i see its a girl but why tie her up like a pretzel
3300284 i wont expect you to appreciate the masses which make that figure much more than a pretzel but you can appreciate what rodin was saying what do people get out of looking at a crucifix
3300285 still you must know that representations of the crucifixion are usually atrocious and ones in churches are the worst blood like catsup and that ex carpenter portrayed as if he were a pansy which he certainly was not he was a hearty man muscular and healthy but a poor portrayal is as effective as a good one for most people they dont see defects they see a symbol which inspires their deepest emotions it recalls them to the agony and sacrifice of god
3300286 but shes more than good art denouncing bad art shes a symbol for every woman who ever shouldered a load too heavy but not alone women this symbol means every man and woman who ever sweated out life in uncomplaining fortitude until they crumpled under their loads its courage ben and victory
3300287 victory in defeat there is none higher she didnt give up ben shes still trying to lift that stone after it has crushed her shes a father working while cancer eats away at his insides to bring home one more paycheck shes a twelve year old trying to mother her brothers and sisters because mama had to go to heaven shes a switchboard operator sticking to her post while wmoke chokes her and fire cuts off her escape shes all the unsung heroes who couldnt make it but never quit come salute as you pass and come see my little mermaid
3300288 is one mike didnt give to me i havent told mike why i got it since it is self evident that its one of the most delightful compositions ever wrought by the eye and hand of man
3300289 which is excuse enough as with kittens and butterflies but there is more shes not quite a mermaid see nor is she human she sits on land where she has chosen to stay and stares eternally out to sea forever lonely for what she left you know the story
3300290 yes she sits by the haven of k benhavn and shes everybody who ever made a difficult choice she doesnt regret it but she must pay for it every choice must be paid for the cost is not only endless homesickness she can never be quite human when she uses her dearly bought feet every step is on sharp knives ben i think that mike walks always on knives but dont tell him i said so
3300291 i wont id rather look at her and not think about knives
3300292 shes a little darling isnt she how would you like to coax her into bed she would be lively as a seal and as slippery
3300293 and getting eviler each year we wont look at any others usually i ration myself to one a day
3300294 suits i feel as if i had had three quick drinks jubal why isnt there stuff like this where a person can see it
3300295 because the world has gone nutty and art always paints the spirit of its times rodin died about the time the world started flipping its lid his successors noted the amazing things he had done with light and shadow and mass and composition and they copied that part what they failed to see was that the master told stories that laid bare the human heart they became contemptuous of painting or sculpture that told stories they dubbed such work literary they went for all out abstractions
3300296 abstract design is all right for wallpaper or linoleum but art is the process of evoking pity and terror what modern artists do is pseudo intellectual masturbation creative art is intercourse in which the artist renders emotional his audience these laddies who wont deign to do that or cant lost the public the ordinary bloke will not buy art that leaves him unmoved if he does pay the money is conned out of him by taxes or such
3300297 jubal ive always wondered why i didnt give a hoot for art i thought it was something missing in me
3300298 mmm one does have to learn to look at art

3300309 weve been fairly fortunate so far you always knock on wood because sometimes these things happen and you really dont have much control over them
3300310 its something that well have to manage on our team at some point throughout the year but i think the fact that our players worked hard in the offseason are in pretty good condition weve improved the strength level we had all but two of our freshmen here for the entire summer all those things seem to contribute in a positive way maybe to being able to stay healthy
3300311 theres also a commitment on their part and how they take care of themselves and how they recover how they rest how they eat all those types of things that contribute to that as well

3300316 tens of millions of credit and debit cards and pin blocks associated with millions of debit cards
3300317 technical assistance from criminal associates in decrypting encrypted pin numbers
3300318 by encoding the data on magnetic stripes of blank credit debit cards and using these cards to obtain tens of thousands of dollars at a time from atms
3300319 the banks have encryption boxes that are claimed to be secure but the claim is of course untrue
3300320 im speculating here but more than likely to compromise that many pin blocks they would have to have gotten the encryption keys somehow
3300321 more than likely there was a breakdown in management of keys wherever the keys were compromised
3300322 armed with the keys and a little know how he said criminals could readily discern pin codes from pin blocks

3300326 they always pass these authorizations with a lot of fanfare as if they are going to spend the money immediately but a lot of these bond bills are over five or ten years
3300327 there is the issue of giving false expectations that theyll be spent in the near term
3300328 you just cant keep spending and borrowing at that rate and expect that taxpayers are going to continue to pay higher taxes
3300329 borrowing so much that hes going to turn around and ask for a very large tax increase
3300330 the bonding is based very much on an affordability analysis
3300331 our capital plan is not a wish list there are some choices that we made
3300332 we can even speed it up if things get really great or slow it down if we hit a wall

3300334 ow ow f ity ow bren when do i get that spinal tap thing
3300335 its called a spinal block and you cant have it yet honey the doctor said youre not dilated enough
3300336 you mean i have to wait for it to get worse why cant they just give it to me now
3300337 its not like i enjoy killing people its just a habit an urge like scrawny chicks have puke and jock dick
3300338 murders easy i just squeeze theres a flash a bang a thund simple
3300339 i had a good childhood parents stayed together i was never hit never molested by sweet but creepy uncle al my folks made enough money to keep us comfortable and we lived in a quiet safe neighborhood
3300340 so when i tell you my first kill was at ten years old i can imagine your shock
3300341 well to be absolutly fair it was an accident we were in his dads room when he showed me the gun i was taken with the weight of it the feel of it the sound of the hammer clicking back i mean i was just playing with it when it went off
3300342 the courts ruled it as an accident the news got a great story for a week before losing interest and everyone got free gun locks not a particularly bad way to pop my murder cherry
3300343 boys are my favorite most of them act all tough and in control and thats why its so great to switch it on them i mean i guess you could say its a sex thing but i dont usually kill the people i fuck sure its a matter of safety what with dna tests and such but mostly because i tend to get attached to them
3300344 and sure i get my heart ripped out but killing out of anger kinda ruins the pleasure of it ya know
3300345 i like picking off the religious too no no i know what youre going to say but follow me here most christians are just counting down the days til the rapture hell half the time they spend those days bitching and moaning about other peoples lives stirrin up trouble against the really good things so in my way of mind im helping them out
3300346 dont go reachin for your cross yet i tend to only go after the loud ones nothings wrong with prayin just keep it out of my laws
3300347 i guess im waiting to be caught admittedly i tend to travel around a lot but thats all part of the job but thats no excuse i say the cops are just damn lazy of course im a cute young white girl not the top of their most wanted list i mean they still have minorities to slam to the pavement

3300368 la detecci n de una nueva cepa del virus de gripe aviar en frica aumenta las serias preocupaciones mientras sigue sin saberse c mo se introdujo esta variedad al continente
3300369 parece ins lito que las aves salvajes hayan acarreado la cepa a africa ya que la ltima migraci n de stas desde europa y asia central a africa ocurri en septiembre de 2007 y la migraci n del sur al continente no ha comenzado todav a este a o
3300370 ciertamente pudo haber otros canales para la introducci n del virus comercio internacional por ejemplo o traslado ilegal y no denunciado de aves de corral esto aumenta el riesgo de que la gripe aviaria se extienda a otros pa ses del oeste de africa

3300455 when the bank boots on the other foot which we reproduce unabridged with acknowledgment
3300456 hello mrs carefree please sit down would you like a cup of coffee
3300457 im not too sure why you asked to come in but notice your business account is 12 512 this morning against an agreed facility of 12 000 i was going to drop you a line about it but now youre hear i wont have to bother
3300458 actually my visit really wasnt about that i have a cheque here in my favour for 125 381 which my aunt left me as the sole beneficiary of her estate i was about
3300459 but youve assured me in the past that you have no account with any mrs carefree indeed i havent but it occurred to me i might open one now
3300460 well the first question i want to ask is what will you do with it
3300461 i would credit to your account of course you might open an investment account with some of it but as a first step it would be credited to your current account
3300462 i dont think you fully understand me what i want to know is what the bank will do with my cheque when you have been prepared to let me have an advance in the past you have always required a fully document case with cash flow forecasts repayment schedules the whole caboodle i thought you might let me have a similar statement
3300463 i dont think i could let you have that your money would become part of the banks general funds to be dealt with in the usual way
3300464 thats whats worrying me how much has the bank lent on risky ventures has it or
3300465 well lets forget that for the moment what security are you offering
3300466 the whole of the bank or just this branch ive looked at the outside and with the
3300467 i seem to remember that you rejected out of hand a statement i made about myself to
3300468 well then what about your personal guarantee i see from the phone book that you
3300469 well we can return to that point later you mentioned putting my money in an
3300470 the banks rate on these accounts 11 5 percent at the moment and we could pay up
3300471 i couldnt afford to pay the 16 5 percent you were recently charging me and said so but you said it wasnt a question of what i could afford that was the banks rate and if you were to tell the banks directors that i couldnt afford the rate of interest and wouldnt be able to service the loan the the facility would not be approved
3300472 i think you must agree that nothing you have come up with this morning has been very satisfactory i think bank has put money into some very risky loans in the past but you were unable to give me any assurances that it wouldnt be putting my money into areas i consider equally doubtful in the future it seems you have no security that you are willing to offer and are reluctant to give me any personal guarantees on your own admission the bank is unable to afford to pay a rate of interest which gives me any real rate of return i suggest that you reconsider your position carefully and if you can come up with something more realistic come round to my office and submit your revised proposals good morning
3300473 please come in and have a seat would you like a cup of coffee
3300474 i imagine youve come in connection with my queries during our meeting yesterday
3300475 mrs carefree contrary to some alarmist media reports the position of australias
3300476 thanks you so much for troubling to provide these figures there are only one or two questions i would like you to answer the assets of our financial institutions in australia which show such astounding growth what are they made up of
3300477 well apart from the buildings land and fixtures owned by the
3300478 in other words the homes farms factories machines and other physical assets of
3300479 in other words the biggest proportion of the assets of our banks consists of the debts of the australian people backed by their property and production
3300480 well y eees but that is normal commercial procedure any where in the
3300481 oh i understand that however there seems to be some discrepancy i feel in the three years you showed me the total assets of our financial institutions were 1970 38 179 billion 1975 78 98 billion 1980 151 92 billion on the other hand for the same years the total volume of money in australia millions was as follows 1970 14 83 billion 1975 28 93 billion and 1980 49 16 billion shouldnt the two balance in each case the total debt to financial institutions was three times the amount of money in australia it seems a little one sided to me
3300482 passing over that one for the moment then may i ask you this if the security for overdrafts you extend are listed in your balance sheet as assets how would you list the deposit of my 125 512 should i finally decide to make it
3300483 it would come under the heading of the banks liabilities
3300484 could you explain then how you overcome the conventional banking acts under which your bank was chartered which prohibit the lending of liabilities
3300485 well if you believe we cant lend our deposits how on earth do you
3300486 if you are suggesting the banks create money out of nothing you have fallen for those oddball funny money theories peddled by strange organizations like the australian league of rights which were totally discredited back in the thirties
3300487 well you have the advantage of me there just what is the australian league of rights and just who discredited such theories in the thirties
3300488 i see not that your answer helps much if as you say you dont know anything about
3300489 well how do you answer its clear suggestion that trading banks create money from
3300490 it seems odds on that house prices will continue to head rapidly south
3300491 in the fall of 2003 after the world learned there were no wmd as habbush had foretold the white house ordered the cia to carry out a deception
3300492 the mission was carried out the letter was created popped up in baghdad and roiled the global new cycles in december 2003 conning even venerable journalists with tom brokaw the mission is a statutory violation of the charter of cia and amendments added in 1991 prohibiting cia from conducting disinformation campaigns on u s soil
3300493 i dont think people are looking at it too narrowly or suskind is when i read his book
3300494 thats where nixon had a problem for telling the cia to block the fbi for part of the watergate investigation
3300495 the central bank intervention on friday and monday indicates discomfort with the recent volatility so we dont expect significant changes in policy
3300496 as we think oil prices wont fall much lower and that the central bank seems unwilling to allow speculative ruble longs to really suffer we dont expect sustained outflows
3300497 there will be a lot of attention focused on the meeting with french foreign minister bernard kouchner in the hope that this can result in a breakthrough
3300498 in that case the markets will react positively but any bounce will be very limited as investor confidence in russia has been badly shaken with the recent sequence of events that includes bps dispute the mechel event and some bad economic indicators
3300499 recent volatility probably owes more than anything to global conditions especially the rally in the dollar and the drop in energy prices
3300500 russia really has little to offer foreign investors in a world where oil is cheap so a drop in oil prices from very expensive to quite expensive does do damage at the margins
3300501 serious damage has been done and investors also need time to reassess the political risk again and to make up their minds whether or not russian markets are worth consideration
3300502 every piece of news about the war in south ossetia is crucial to which way the pendulum swings

3300504 not since the 1930s facing the great depression and the impending danger of a fascist new world order and the 1960s with a previous illegal and immoral war has there been such a great outpouring of political art at the present a great many artists working in media old and new have again picked up their brushes cameras or computers to protest against a foul war destruction of the environment obscene fiscal gains and abnegation of constitutional rights to express their rage and speak to the public
3300505 if the banksters create in the way previously described and lend it by way of overdrafts and loans why is it that they do own the assets of australia lock stock and barrel
3300506 every loan overdraft or bank purchase creates a deposit and every repayment of a loan overdraft or bank sale destroys a deposit
3300507 truly i tell you unless you change and become like children you will never enter the kingdom of heaven whoever becomes humble like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me see that you do not despise one of these little ones for i say to you that their angels in heaven always look upon the face of my heavenly father what is your opinion if a man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray will he not leave the ninety nine in the hills and go in search of the stray and if he finds it amen i say to you he rejoices more over it than over the ninety nine that did not stray in just the same way it is not the will of your heavenly father that one of these little ones be lost
3300508 jesus christ is all my riches he alone is sufficient for me
3300509 all the faithful were edified by the fervor of his devout celebration of mass the efficacy of his deep humility his tender compassion his upright life the harmonious congruity in all his actions words and bearing who without wonderment could look upon a most charming young man the son of so mighty a king outstanding for his generosity raised to such dignity renowned for his influence preeminent for humility living a life of such mortification endowed with such wisdom clothed in so poor a habit yet renowned for the charm of his discourse and a shining example of upright life
3300510 so then let us pursue the things which make for peace and the building up of one another
3300511 um lindo espa o provavelmente um dos mais prestigiados centros culturais na em toda a cidade e n s estamos muito felizes em realizar o evento aqui este ano
3300512 its a beautiful venue its probably one of the most prestigious cultural centers in the whole city and were incredibly happy to be having it here this year
3300513 its really a dream venue for this type of thing
3300514 all that city you just couldnt see an end to it the end
3300515 if i havent created a new energy policy that speaks to our dependence on foreign oil and deals seriously with global warming then weve missed the boat

3300519 for centuries women have been distanced from religion from the pillars of islam
3300520 sometimes its as much about psychology as it is religion
3300521 the world is wide open we have satellite tv in the highest villages of the atlas mountains and we cant escape these alien influences all we can do is find an immunity within the body
3300522 these extremists say were infidels because we dont pray correctly even if im a muslim and i believe in allah and his prophet muhammad we didnt think these people existed here until they started blowing things up
3300523 we also know that moroccans are feeding into the pipeline of foreign fighters going to iraq
3300524 the police here arent very methodical they arrest 200 people to catch one terrorist
3300525 this is islam lite its like throwing powder in our eyes to distract us
3300526 we need to restore a version of islam that has less machismo

3300537 israel will almost surely attack irans nuclear sites in the next four to seven months
3300538 iran wants no war with any country and today iran is a friend of the united states and even israel
3300539 it is apparent that iran has not yet perfected uranium enrichment and as a direct result of u n sanctions irans ability to procure technology or items of significance to its missile programs is being impaired
3300540 the evidence shows that your excessive consumption of alcohol was a contributing factor in the incident
3300541 it was just so cruel and unthinking and so wrong because there is nothing you can do to prevent yourself being raped it is not illegal to go out and have a drink it is illegal to rape somebody
3300542 it was immoral my immediate reaction was there has got to be some way to fight this
3300543 it used to be that they were always blamed if they were wearing a short skirt today its that they were drinking
3300544 its very important for women whove been victims of rape to get compensation because often its the only acknowledgement you are going to get that you have been a victim of crime given that the conviction rate in this country is only 6
3300545 we have just completed a review of our staff instructions operating procedures and structure to ensure greater consistency in decision making
3300546 reduce the level of award to a victim of rape due to alcohol consumption
3300547 this stance supports our view that a victim of rape is not in any way culpable due to alcohol consumption

3300556 what is going to be the benefit of using it here and how can we express the benefit
3300557 i am delighted i thought it was an excellent performance
3300558 we have set our standards and the question now is can we maintain it
3300559 it was great to get a goal early on and that settled us but i am just delighted with how we played in general
3300560 i thought the fans got behind the team and it was an enjoyable afternoon three goals a good display and lets look to the next one
3300561 we have proved we can play but now we have to do it every week it is how we handle it
3300562 i think players have got to learn from games like tuesday night it is important they go out and enjoy and express themselves
3300563 i am looking forward to a championship side coming here the bottom line is it is 11 versus 11
3300564 can we produce the type of performance we did on saturday can we take our chances i dont think we have anything to fear
3300565 i watched qpr last week and they are a good side of course they are but it is a case of what we do in the game if we can play with the same commitment and keep the same possession then we have got a good chance if not the bigger and better teams like qpr will punish us
3300566 a cup run is vitally important for this football club
3300567 ive had fairly decent success in this competition over the last few years and i want to continue that with qpr
3300568 we werent at our best on saturday and there is a lot of room for improvement
3300569 defensively we werent as good as i know we can be and ill be looking for an improvement on tuesday
3300570 a good cup run is very important to me and well be heading to swindon with a very strong squad make no mistake
3300571 theyve brought a couple of new faces in and it certainly wont be easy for us at their place
3300572 its important that we really impose ourselves on the match from the opening whistle i want to see us get the ball down and pass it and be creative like we were against barnsley at the weekend
3300573 the county ground isnt an easy place to go but we head there in good spirits after our win on saturday
3300574 the early rounds come quite thick and fast in this competition and if things go your way before you know it you come up against one of the big boys
3300575 well take each game as it comes though and that starts with swindon town at the county ground
3300576 there are places that have got numbers of players competing for
3300577 you have to be on song because if you dont play another player might come in and take your place i guess it is the same on tuesday
3300578 if someone was rested because it was the cup and his rival hit a hat trick then you would lose your spot you want to be playing every game at the moment
3300579 getting off the mark on the opening day was brilliant i always want to score goals myself but the most important thing is getting three points for the team
3300580 i am out there now and it is all down to one person myself if i dont perform and lose my place then i will be angry with myself as long as i keep performing it will be hard to drop me
3300581 we want teams to come here and not to like it at all
3300582 bring on tuesday and hopefully the lads can put on the same performance or better than against tranmere
3300583 i think qpr are the chelsea of the championship arent they they have got money to spend but it is a normal football match
3300584 there are two teams out there and we dont care what players they have got the players that we have got if on song can trouble anyone out there
3300585 that will always be my outlook going into any cup competitions
3300586 if you look at the big picture then it is a fantastic opportunity to generate revenue and that is a part of my job the easiest way to do that is to have a good run although its a long shot we will give the carling cup everything we can
3300587 go into the world and tell them its true that i love them all just like i love u
3300588 we made it were here were here right now and were not leaving
3300589 now we have reports that more and more people are just taking on ramps onto the bridge and are just taking it over its just just
3300590 reports from protests from amman jordan amsterdam and beirut lebanon east timor florence italy london milano italy paris france in dozens of cities in spain reports in athens georgia and austin texas blacksburg virginia charleston south carolina colorado springs and defiance ohio denver colorado as well as durango geneva new york and houston texas hyannis massachussetts in hawaii as well lawrence kansas los angeles california and i am only naming a few
3300591 it isnt enough to talk about peace one must believe in it it isnt enough to believe in it one must work at it
3300592 peace is possible and even necessary so drop the sword and pick up the hammer and the saw and lets build a better world
3300593 we will not go to war for a selected president who wasnt even elected
3300594 thousands of people have taken over 3rd avenue and are marching north the crowd stretches at least 15 blocks from 44th street to 59th street the police have just simply given up
3300595 we will not sell out we will not back down we will not compromise we will go forward until peace is on the worlds agenda

3300600 im still trying to find someone but i dont think it will get any better in the foreseeable future
3300601 the process is very time consuming and i am already very busy as it is

3300745 this was a one off it was a very exciting stage a starting stage and the most important thing will be to turn up to every single test match like weve done this week
3300746 my main driving force for this team is to be every single day up for the challenge of improving having no comfort zones and testing the guys out to perform every single day
3300747 ive certainly done some thinking about australia next year a lot more than when i would have when i was a player because you want to get the structure right so guys can play in certain positions feel comfortable know their role and deliver

3300758 it was like going to war with a pen knife in a gun fight they were better conditioned fitter and technically superior
3300759 they took the game at a pace which surprised us
3300760 tunisia overpowered us in open play and broke through our line at will which is a big concern
3300761 players burn out turning for the national team and the local league there is an urgent need to revise the season so that it complies with the international rugby board calendar to give the national team more time to concentrate on assignments uganda have gone this way and we also need to follow suit
3300762 there was a system we were already working on and it was almost impossible for the new players to fit in at a short notice but we also need to pay attention to the conditioning of the players and gym work is paramount
3300763 it is good to be considered as favourites but i have always preferred an underdogs tag because i dont want to carry avoidable pressure on my shoulders
3300764 we want to play as hard as we can without unnecessary pressures but it is good to know that people consider us a team to be reckoned with and i hope we come out with flying colours
3300765 we are working extremely hard and our warm up trip to england is providing us the real platform from where we can deliver our best performance
3300766 the pre event tour is helping us to acclimatise as the weather in belfast will be close to what we are presently experiencing here lets not forget that we are coming from africa where the weather is hot
3300767 this leg of the tour is extremely important to our chances in the tournament because everything in stormont will happen so fast that there will be very little time to recover we have to enter the tournament fully prepared and equipped
3300768 every international tournament or match we play only helps kenya cricket while the team gets stronger and tougher more youth get attracted to the sport that helps to increase the pool of players
3300769 we played in the icc world twenty20 in south africa and although we didnt performance well we learnt plenty of things it was a new format for all of us and since then we have followed and tried to learn from watching most of the twenty20 matches that have been played across the globe
3300770 the team would love to translate the experience it gained in south africa into the belfast tournament so that we can come to england in 11 months time as an even better team
3300771 we are not short in motivation but i agree that the dream of playing in england is quite fascinating i played in the icc cricket world cup in 1999 and it is one of the highlights of my career
3300772 since twenty20 cricket is played at a fast pace the mindset has to be sharp to cope with the proceedings and thats where it can sometimes become mentally tiring
3300773 we had a discussion on this issue and thought it was better to have the players keep the money rather than buy them air tickets
3300774 we have to live with this we are professionals and these are some of the hardships we endure
3300775 we are glad that we were able to turn our troubles into success and thats what matters most
3300776 cecafa has been left with no option but to take stern action on yanga
3300777 we are considering a way to better reflect these rising costs in the prices of our next pcs
3300778 lifting prices as competitors prices are sliding could spur consumers to move away from nec

3300780 we have had a good session to shake off the jet lag and are raring to go
3300781 defence leaked and every player must fall back to defend
3300782 tunisians maybe big but rugby is not about size cameroon forwards were also bigger than our forwards but with the right technique size is relative there is a chance that tunisia will overpower us in the forwards but if we spread the game and raise the intensity in the first 20 minutes then we will a better chance of winning

3300861 it sai must have definitely manipulated my sample otherwise how could other samples taken just about a fortnight later be negative if it is not the great indian dope trick then what is it
3300862 moreover if i am tested positive why was i still kept in olympic camp for more than two months

3300865 i thought it should have been a lot closer after the first round
3300866 i think the score was bad i think they were giving him a score for anything and i had to work to get all of my points i knew going in that the only way i could win this fight is dont let him hit me
3300867 im not saying he won but when youre chasing the bout you do things youre not comfortable with im not grouching here we lost fair and square but you saw it for yourselves
3300868 im very sad i thought i would be the winner i already beat him once before
3300869 i think the more you look at it the more gutted you are because it was actually stoppable
3300870 you know a moment of brilliance cost us the game

3300880 hes mastered that strategy harry reid is very concerned with the survival of harry reid
3300881 immediately liked reid when he took over because he was partisan
3300882 i dont want it to seem like its a big lovefest for harry reid in the netroots but we respect him
3300883 harry reid is on a lot of issues a good ally thats the highest praise we can give
3300884 you really have seen this evolution of skepticism about reid who is not a liberal democrat to now where you see him take on the classic national liberal democratic leadership profile
3300885 when he comes back to nevada hes still harry reid from searchlight nev but hes now one of them the democratic elite

3300960 last 10 days we were trying to read the targets and i had some difficulty today that also explains the relative low scores in the field today
3300961 when we shoot the first shot the bird is not actually there we only expect it there its anticipation and much like a catch in cricket where you stretch your arm to intercept the ball little hesitation and you are doomed
3300962 i had trouble reading the first target and it affected anticipation as well
3300963 im upset that i could not hold on to my scores i did not shoot very high this year but that should have been enough to qualify for the finals here at the end i have not been able to achieve what we came here for

3301006 you think i dont know this what gives you the right to speak as if you have authority over me you have none i like his use of the words wanton woman they are biblical maybe there is some hope for k man after all you there is no hope for you at all you freak of nature go back to the hole you came out of
3301007 i have no need for sex id rather tease you honeybuns
3301008 chips on you dud you got bugged for being near me viruses transmit that way you know
3301009 the nonsense screeds you compose and post to usenet lack any kind of coherent and rational meaning whatsoever and are composed of random bits and pieces stolen from mythology science fiction religion comic books etc placed into a blender and the switch turned to the highest setting about every other screed has droppings of death threats racial bigotry laughably false prophesies of gloom and doom and inane attempts to extort money these bland meaningless pulpy messes are then trowled into usenet identical or nearly identical screeds are repeated ad nauseum
3301010 q how many bush administration officials does it take to change a light bulb a none there is no need to change anything we made the right decision to stick with that light bulb people who say that it is burned out are giving aid and encouragement to the forces of darkness

3301012 we are most nearly ourselves when we achieve the seriousness of the child at play
3301013 and thats another mistake on your part your playing games on usenet and im not playing it has nothing to do with impressing you it has more to do with making sure you have the education youll need to debate the debate is no fun for me if you are mentally incapable of it im giving you an opportunity to educate yourself thats all
3301014 but now the end is near now mark foley comes along and is making
3301015 he is the last person i would want to have to deal with this problem
3301016 this time they have done it really good especially the layout last time they had put up a lighthouse which was also beautiful
3301017 there are varieties of flowers fruits and vegetables vegetable carving it could have been an educational tour for the kids too
3301018 flowers are very pretty but what attracted kids most is the information that how pumpkins bitter gourd and potatoes are grown
3301019 sadly trophy jaws and teeth from sharks are relatively commonplace whereas living sharks are becoming increasingly rare
3301020 sharks have continual turnover of dentition throughout their lifespan and consequently teeth may be collected from the seafloor in areas where sharks aggregate without the need to use invasive sampling methods such as biopsy
3301021 these data support our hunch that low genetic variation in grey nurse shark is probably due to longer term processes than the recent human induced population crash
3301022 we also have plans to use approaches like this to identify rogue individuals
3301023 we want to tell the people that even after being infected by hiv we are playing we want to tell them that the disease doesnt spread through touching others we want to tell people on how the infection spread s and how it doesnt
3301024 we want to remove the stigma from the minds of the people it is important and for that the game is one of the best mediums

3301026 the seals are in a key area and they can measure important parameters that are difficult to obtain otherwise
3301027 this programme is organised every year and people from across the country come here to participate bhang addiction is different from addiction of other intoxicants after consuming a person only thinks of lord shiva
3301028 this mixture has five kilograms of almonds two kilograms of pistachio milk saffron minimum 10 to 15 thousand rupees are spent and then proper bhang drink is prepared
3301029 the 1 6 per cent market tax imposed by the government is illegal all the traders and the labourers are protesting against this this demonstration shows that the government should accept our demand and withdraw this tax
3301030 if the factory is closed how will we earn our livelihood the government has imposed tax but we get only rs 44 a day how will we pay the tax
3301031 the hydrocarbon economies of the gulf are now an international force with world class companies creating windfall profits to help governments diversify away from oil
3301032 there are huge profits in the oil and gas industry but in 30 years from now perhaps less it may be a very different story so diversification now is key to sustainable long term growth
3301033 unlike the previous oil booms of the 1970s and 1980s the region is investing heavily in infrastructure and its own future which is clearly reflected in the current civil construction boom
3301034 the gcc countries recognise that they have been dependent completely on oil and gas and are trying to diversify their economies
3301035 gulf countries have historically underinvested in their own infrastructure but have clearly realised the requirement to do so now that paradigm shift is becoming hugely apparent in this latest research
3301036 we are seeing it not only in infrastructure such as roads airports railways but also in utilities such as power generation and water which are also seeing massive investment the value of gcc power generation projects for example is projected to peak by the end of 2009 at us 27 billion with water projects contributing us 15 billion
3301037 a quanto pare si tratta di un ordigno improvvisato che ha colpito lautobus

3301039 the application of chlorinated pvc piping in the olympic pool project is expected to bring new recognition for this high performance polymer in a country exploding with growth
3301040 there was a rigorous evaluation process for the materials used in this project
3301041 a fast and easy solvent cement joining system saved countless hours compared to the soldering required on metallic systems
3301042 in addition cpvc is lightweight which makes it easier to maneuver on the job site depending on the diameter of the pipe cpvc is between one sixth and one eighth the weight of metal
3301043 corzan materials are currently being used in various industrial applications in china including the steel chemical chlor alkali paper making and metallurgy industries
3301044 its usage has increased significantly throughout the country especially in the past decade for numerous residential commercial and industrial projects
3301045 it is important that individuals and employers remember their duties under the law to take reasonable care of the health and safety of others
3301046 the injuries inflicted could have been significantly worse or even fatal operators of lift trucks must ensure that they operate them in accordance with training and employers must ensure that they are used safely
3301047 will learn from the findings of this case and continue to improve
3301048 malil and the victim had apparently been in a dating relationship which recently ended
3301049 the decision regarding making me jharkhand cm was taken long back but it is getting delayed hence we arrived at the decision to withdraw support for koda government if he does not resign now
3301050 i will take oath as new cm as soon has he koda resigns there
3301051 on the basis of your report i have taken the decision to bring to an end the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace
3301052 the bombs hit in front of us and beside us several people were wounded and lying in the street we got straight out of there
3301053 our goal is to free the kodori gorge of georgian troops today the assault begins it is a high mountain operation
3301054 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3301055 the cold war has long ended but the mentality of the cold war has stayed firmly in the minds of several us diplomats it is a real shame

3301064 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3301065 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3301066 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
3301067 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
3301068 it is all about projecting the right image of china with no respect for honesty or for the audience
3301069 i do not think the chinese state realises how unethical this is they dont understand what kind of values they are reflecting
3301070 this is an insult to the real singer and to all the people who listened
3301071 theyre basically big springs at the base of the rocket
3301072 the ares team is doing well enough on their margins for performance that im comfortable that theyll be able to absorb the mass impact that these things imply with no problem
3301073 its very clear that eliminating this protein has cardiovascular benefits
3301074 rna based drugs might provide a course of treatment for people whose cholesterol levels are resistant to current drugs or they might be combined with current drugs
3301075 these neurons seem to have been registering after the rat made its decision how uncertain the animal was that it was about to receive its desired reward we tested several alternative explanations but the best explanation for the neural activity we observed was that these neurons were signalling the confidence of the animal about its decisions
3301076 although previous work had suggested that confidence estimates might be a complex process restricted to humans and perhaps other primates our results to the contrary show that for the brain to estimate confidence in a choice is no more complex than calculating the choice itself
3301077 this new option to abort and restart constitutes a decision that should be made based on the level of confidence about getting a reward
3301078 ultimately confidence about getting a reward is a direct function of the animals confidence about the decision they have just made in this way we sought to measure a variable internal to the animals how confident they were about whether they made the right choice or not by observing how it influenced their behaviour
3301079 that confidence estimation is not a complex function specific to humans but a core component of the process of decision making probably found throughout the animal kingdom
3301080 our study was also able to demonstrate that for patients at an average risk for gi bleeding starting ppi cotherapy at a younger age was marginally cost effective while starting ppi cotherapy at an older age was highly cost effective ultimately physicians should discuss the gastrointestinal risks of low dose aspirin with their patients and consider ppi cotherapy
3301081 many americans are currently taking low dose aspirin for coronary heart disease and we know that ppis are effective in reducing ulcer bleeding in patients on aspirin what we didnt know however was whether it is worth paying for these drugs for patients on low dose aspirin who had no other risk factors
3301082 it is an important case and the hearing should therefore be continued half the country has been lost due to belated decisions
3301083 the work being done by the manipal education and medical group is commendable they have been at the forefront of providing international level medical education and medical services to the society and that too at affordable rates i wish them all the very best in all their future endeavours and hope that they continue the good work and more importantly guard the quality of services they provide
3301084 i also congratulate manipal cure and care for this revolutionising concept of preventive healthcare wellness and beauty under one roof which is the need of the hour this innovative concept will go a long way to keep our citizens healthy and hearty
3301085 prevention is better than cure is an old adage we very often repeat but rarely follow memg and mcc are both committed towards strengthening the roots of preventive medicine in india our vision is to revolutionize healthcare delivery in india by providing preventive monitoring with a focus on wellness through manipal cure and care centres we will educate people to be proactive towards health issues and strive to make every indian a healthy citizen
3301086 we take the business of preventive medicine very seriously and will keep introducing newer products and services that will help indian citizens understand and take advantages of its benefits and that too at affordable costs our critical differentiator is that the fact that all our centers offers services and counselling by well trained doctor and paramedical staff protocols and processes in line with international best practices and an in store experience that is highly personalised for each customer
3301087 i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get many things that are so smart
3301088 the dark knight is like a ferrari engine of storytelling and scriptwriting and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie
3301089 i didnt understand the dark knight i still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy
3301090 im like i get it this is so high brow and so f king smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie
3301091 a major factor in this increase has been the change in cheerleading activity which now involves gymnastic type stunts if these cheerleading activities are not taught by a competent coach and keep increasing in difficulty catastrophic injuries will continue to be a part of cheerleading

3301094 het gaat allemaal de goede richting uit maar het voornaamste probleem is dat het personeel omwille van eerdere niet ingeloste beloftes geen vertrouwen meer heeft in de directie
3301095 mogelijk kunnen de twee referenda gelijktijdig gehouden worden en kan bij goedkeuring in beide bedrijven de operaties samen hervat worden
3301096 het is hun taak om beide ploegen aan te moedigen en om een aangename sfeer te cre ren
3301097 veel mensen dagen niet op voor de voorronden maar dat is niet verwonderlijk
3301098 het is jammer voor janko tipsarevic dat hij moest opgeven want het is een heel sympathiek kerel
3301099 russell is being his usual cocky self in the video playing the sexuality card with britney
3301100 he is flirting with her and tells her he can feel a powerful sexual tension between them
3301101 but britney has the measure of him saying she doesnt feel any tension before referring to him as russell brown she really puts him in his place
3301102 she looks back to her best in the video and seems to have put all her troubles behind her
3301103 the uml leaders have said that if the nc does not join the government the maoists should be allowed to lead the government they will decide on this issue through the meeting

3301108 if we play like we played this week then we will beat australia it is going to take a lot to do it this is a one off and a starting stage but the key is to turn up to every single test match like we did this week
3301109 what we have got to do is look at the australians and learn from them they are on it every day and every session that is what we have to do and my main drive with this team is to be on top of it every day and make sure we do not have any comfort zones
3301110 i have been doing a lot of thinking over the last few days about scenarios i definitely have done a lot more thinking about australia than i would have done as a player because you want to get your structure right so players play in certain position for a long amount of time they can then feel comfortable know their role and deliver
3301111 he was a lovely man but i was very young i didnt know who i was and i was still struggling as an actor i was a terrible wife
3301112 would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3301113 there is no justification for continued russian military action in georgia which threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe
3301114 they even killed female goats because their private parts were not covered and their tails were pointed upward which they said was haram
3301115 they regarded the cucumber as male and tomato as female women were not allowed to buy cucumbers only men
3301116 de verenigde staten hebben een grote blunder begaan door het regime in georgi te doen geloven dat het zonder risico militair kon optreden in zuid osseti
3301117 door uit te roepen dat de kaukasus een regio duizenden kilometers verwijderd van het amerikaanse continent tot haar invloedssfeer behoort beging de vs een grote blunder
3301118 natuurlijk heeft iedereen belang bij vrede in de kaukasus maar iedereen met een beetje gezond verstand weet dat rusland met de regio is verbonden door een gemeenschappelijke geografie en een eeuwenlange geschiedenis
3301119 heeft niet de bedoeling om zijn grondgebied uit te breiden maar heeft wel legitieme belangen in de regio
3301120 de georgische leiders zouden nooit een militair offensief hebben durven lanceren zonder het gevoel te hebben dat zij gesteund en aangemoedigd worden door een grotere krijgsmacht
3301121 ook de belofte dat georgi in de navo zou worden opgenomen heeft bij het georgische besluit om in zuid osseti een blitzkrieg te lanceren meegespeeld
3301122 de voorstelling van zaken als zou rusland de agressor zijn tegen een zwak en kwetsbaar landje is niet alleen hypocriet maar ook onmenselijk

3301124 as the adoption of terracottas technology accelerates the need for a strong partner network is clearer every day we have selected these highly skilled partners due to the resources they bring to bear and together we will provide our customers the best solutions possible
3301125 weve established a high standard of aesthetics across all aspects of our business
3301126 and that extends to our vehicles because we want them to make a statement about our professionalism and high standards in our specialist area of machinery removals
3301127 as well as that we want to make sure that our crews travel in comfort the guys in our teams are both drivers and skilled machinery removal and installation engineers its a difficult job and its important that they arrive on site relaxed and ready to start work the truck cab can also be their rest room during long spells on site so it needs to be properly equipped for them to take their breaks
3301128 it means that well likely see vegetation shift a lot faster than we might think
3301129 californias history can and has been written as successive battles over water waged both within the state and with surrounding states and mexico israel jordan and the palestinian authority are waging similar battles attempting to resolve their problems of scarcity drought and allocation in the middle of a politically tense region
3301130 in many ways these two regions that are on opposite ends of the planet have very similar problems yet it seems there are distinct differences in how california and the middle east attempt to find solutions our hope is that our experiences from the middle east may have relevance to similar issues in the western united states
3301131 sobre la base de su informe he tomado la decisi n de poner fin a la operaci n para forzar a las autoridades georgianas a la paz

3301136 intervenci n militar estaba planeada desde hace meses o a os y busca al menos ocupar y anexionarse osetia del sur y abjasia y como resultado final ocupar toda georgia
3301137 rusia dijeron s lo quiere normalizar la situaci n y restablecer la paz y que el pueblo georgiano decida el futuro de sus dirigentes
3301138 australias future will also depend on our ability to engage constructively and effectively with the countries of the asia pacific
3301139 that is why i am committed to making australia the most asia literate country in the collective west
3301140 by investing in asian languages and cultural education in australias schools my vision is for the next generation of australians businessmen and women economists accountants lawyers architects artists film makers and performers to develop language skills which open their region to them
3301141 australias future will also depend on our ability to engage constructively and effectively with the countries of the asia pacific
3301142 we were willing to try anything really wed both always wanted children
3301143 its overwhelming im still staring at her now thinking wow shes ours its actually happened for us
3301144 i hope that if anybody going through treatment sees us and sees evie it gives them one last little bit of hope to go for it
3301145 its been a real emotional rollercoaster theres been ups and downs but you get through it and to have evie now you forget what you went through it makes it all worthwhile
3301146 i still cant believe it we waited so long and now shes actually here
3301147 we chose not to know if we were having a boy or a girl until she was born shes the first girl born on either side of the family since rebecca
3301148 it would be nice to have a little brother or sister for evie but at the moment we are just treasuring every moment we have with her
3301149 the first published study on babies born from vitrification shows no adverse effects of the technique and there are no implications to evies health as a result of the vitrification process
3301150 shes been here for one week and hasnt seen a doctor even though they know she has been shot

3301154 la detecci n de una nueva cepa del virus de gripe aviar en frica aumenta las serias preocupaciones mientras sigue sin saberse c mo se introdujo esta variedad al continente
3301155 parece ins lito que las aves salvajes hayan acarreado la cepa a africa ya que la ltima migraci n de stas desde europa y asia central a africa ocurri en septiembre de 2007 y la migraci n del sur al continente no ha comenzado todav a este a o
3301156 ciertamente pudo haber otros canales para la introducci n del virus comercio internacional por ejemplo o traslado ilegal y no denunciado de aves de corral esto aumenta el riesgo de que la gripe aviaria se extienda a otros pa ses del oeste de africa

3301185 we view worn out tyres not as rubbish but as the raw product for something else
3301186 amid ever growing awareness around company and individual environmental and waste recycling responsibilities it is essential that major organisations such as kwik fit lead by example and display their corporate social responsibility credentials
3301187 our customers major contract hire and leasing companies rental firms and companies with car and van fleets are increasingly conscious of environmental issues and understandably expect their supplier partners to also have a green agenda
3301188 the opening of the national distribution centre has enabled kwik fit to not only improve our recycling effectiveness but improve efficiencies in our transport operations that will save up to three million miles a year and an estimated 3 000 tonnes of carbon in reduced emissions

3301192 the combined industry programme is a major and timely investment in national infrastructure that everyone depends on and we know will be severely challenged by climate change
3301193 enjoyed the lowest bills in the industry for many years
3301194 we also have it should be remembered a growing population in london and the south east
3301195 we have we estimate about 380 000 more people coming in to the region and we have to make sure that our infrastructure our networks our treatment works are all ready to cope with that influx of people
3301196 we believe our draft plan provides the best balance between improved services the needs of the water environment and a cost that customers are willing to pay
3301197 they want a safe reliable water supply they want an effective sewerage system but above all they want prices not to go above inflation
3301198 this is the start of the process of making decisions on how each company proposes to provide value for money long term high quality water services to its customers
3301199 we will now examine draft business plans in detail checking the proposed level of service and investment
3301200 we will make sure each plan includes everything we expect takes account of concerns expressed by customers and does so as efficiently as possible

3301313 el d a de la ceremonia hubo pisadas humanas aut nticas de sur a norte de la ciudad
3301314 sin embargo debido a la escasa visibilidad durante la noche puede que se haya usado material pregrabado
3301315 la mayor a de la gente no not la diferencia
3301316 est bamos convencidas de que nos iba a ir mejor que ese octavo puesto y ac estamos orgullosas de lo que hemos hecho
3301317 cuando sal del agua y escuch la reacci n del p blico me di cuenta de que tendr amos una medalla
3301318 esto es un sue o cumplido pero simplemente parte de ese sue o ahora quiero volver a subir a ese podio que es tan lindo pero m s arriba
3301319 cuando subimos al tercer intento nos deseamos mutuamente suerte porque sab amos que la bamos a necesitar pero m s confi bamos en nuestra capacidad porque para eso nos entrenamos

3301322 it is testament to the hard work of everyone in involved that we have been able to confirm an alternative venue for the mountain biking competition only seven months after the venue change was announced
3301323 in hadleigh farm we have a world class venue for games time with the potential for an excellent facility for elite and community use post games
3301324 growth in 2007 was relatively restrained but we predict many marketers are conserving funds for the anticipated olympic bonanza this year
3301325 ifa is working as a business company with goals and targets we are very happy to welcome these two international brands hisense and adidas as our partners and are looking forward to a sound and successful cooperation
3301326 they told me we succeeded we are the world champions i told them we reached our target
3301327 other teams were good but we were better we performed perfect today everyone was excellent
3301328 it bothers me a lot especially if people from home kind of put down our team saying count the u
3301329 i wish more people in the u s believed in us like we believed in us now i hope more people realize the u s is a force to be reckoned with
3301330 since athens the chinese team has run into a lot of failures which tested the team
3301331 i know them and they do work very hard and put a lot of hard work in their training we worked as team we enjoyed it and thats more important than anything
3301332 we always believed in ourselves and we kept at it tenacious
3301333 and our guys knocked it out of the park it was just amazing
3301334 y ou can whet ones appetite but you eat at home
3301335 it happened and the sooner we can come to grips with that the better off we will be for me personally anger is not an emotion i will allow myself to indulge in
3301336 our focus has been on trying to attend to barbara and her needs and trying to deal with the shock of losing todd and trying to begin the grieving process as well
3301337 clearly elisabeth was a victim in this as well even though she was physically unscathed he said
3301338 having to deal with this event has been hard for her
3301339 she has shown incredible strength in the last couple of days weve been able to talk through it and there have been a lot of tears and hugs the fact that shes able to get in amongst it and already be able to address what happened is a testament to her strength of character
3301340 i believe random acts of violence are random acts of violence he said
3301341 it seems unfortunately a case of the wrong place at the wrong time
3301342 he was a great father a loving husband its hard to imagine a nicer person that this tragic and senseless thing could happen to
3301343 we are all definitely emotionally drained and have been playing with a lot of emotion for the last 48 hours said lindsey berg an ex gopher

3301345 el ppc ha hablado de una posici n com n en la defensa de una financiaci n justa para catalu a
3301346 una cuesti n es el estatut y otra muy distinta es la defensa de una postura com n
3301347 si no conocen los ingresos que van a tener es muy dif cil hacer frente a los gastos sociales
3301348 seguimos manteniendo que las medidas no est n siendo eficaces
3301349 es cierto que las medidas no son muchas veces a corto plazo sino de medio y largo plazo pero tambi n es verdad que llevamos desde la legislatura pasada sin hacer pr cticamente nada
3301350 muy complicado decir que se est n haciendo las cosas bien
3301351 estoy furioso y molesto porque una ciclista espa ola fue la primera deportista que da positivo en los juegos
3301352 me enfurece que sea un ciclista el que acapara titulares en el mundo a pesar de todo lo que hemos hecho
3301353 hay que recibir con cierto escepticismo todas las declaraciones de la federaci n espa ola sobre dopaje porque la federaci n ha defendido siempre a los atletas involucrados en casos de dopaje
3301354 no han sido severos con los infractores cu ntos ciclistas fueron pillados en espa a no creo que nadie haya sido acusado de nada en los tribunales
3301355 da la impresi n de que no hay una voluntad real de perseguir a los atletas involucrados hay un problema cultural en espa a si tantos ciclistas est n dispuestos a doparse
3301356 al tanto de padres de ciclistas juveniles que compran productos dopantes para sus hijos
3301357 a pesar de todas las medidas tomadas todav a ha ciclistas dispuestos a correr el riesgo de doparse es algo absurdo

3301363 we are concerned about the fact we do not have full stadia
3301364 we think it is due to the weather the humidity and then the rain and on the first couple of days there were not many spectators who showed up
3301365 there are also reserved seats for the olympic family that have not been taken up the preliminary rounds are sometimes not attended and people at other events have tickets for the whole day and do not attend the every event
3301366 listen you cant do that because the five billion creators of this free software will be very angry
3301367 eu acordei esta manh e ainda estava com dor ent o junto com os m dicos n s decidimos fazer um exame

3301370 esta minha ltima olimp ada podemos conseguir o ouro temos de pensar positivo
3301371 na argentina eu dizia a todo mundo que jogar com essas duas sele es talvez fosse mais dif cil que com outras melhores
3301372 para mim seria doloroso n o ganharmos nenhuma medalha o ouro seria o melhor claro porque treinamos todos os dias com esse objetivo temos uma boa equipe mas devemos jogar melhor do que jogamos hoje
3301373 under house arrest for the inappropriate actions of a few
3301374 i cant believe theyd be that stupid to try and dust off a statute its sort of like trying to prosecute people for adultery or something
3301375 its been fully litigated and they cant do it thats all there is
3301376 we must do this because we cannot and will not tolerate innocent people especially children to be victims
3301377 this is not something we take likely but given the incident of this weekend we need to take firm action and this is the kind of action thats required in order to ensure the safety of our residents
3301378 but this is aimed at helping young people in our city this is not an attempt to be punitive
3301379 the charge sheet is proceeding along well and it will be pretty heavy i think he will resign and not stand for charges in parliament
3301380 we decided that we will back president musharraf there is no question of him quitting he was elected to a five year term
3301381 good riddance to musharraf but what does it really mean
3301382 people are so focused on finding a scapegoat meanwhile the dollar is at 74 rupees and the price of gas is skyrocketing
3301383 theres nobody today that cannot find sugar if they want it
3301384 kind of a slap in the face to american producers

3301387 a cloud over a sugar industry that has been dealing with depressed prices and soaring input costs for some time
3301388 we have price increases extremely rarely and theyre driven by what id call uncontrollable costs
3301389 we dont have price increases because my kid needs braces
3301390 were hoping to really get this into the boutiques and the food stores and specialty shops

3301400 every toilet in san francisco into basically a shrine for george w bush and all his great achievements in his eight years as our commander in chief
3301401 and its just one more way of wasting money and the taxpayers time
3301402 this is the best memorial that san francisco is going to give to george bush and he should appreciate it for its face value for exactly what it is its actually the least we can do

3301411 it was a bad tackle he knows that but hes not hot tempered
3301412 it was the first game its a passionate time and perhaps he was a bit frustrated but im not condoning it

3301426 in discussions with potential licensing partners investors and healthcare practitioners however there has always been a degree of scepticism that a small dose of peptides given orally could lead to significant clinical effects

3301428 we can only go by what people say and their body language president hu jintao and premier wen jiabao at every meeting with the prime minister have indicated that they will not be a problem
3301429 that happens when they meet and even in telephone conversations pakistan did its damnedest to block us in the international atomic energy agency iaea but china took a very correct position
3301430 we are hopeful if you take what happened in the iaea when the board of governors debated the india specific safeguards agreement some countries took a strong line particularly on the non proliferation front
3301431 that is the central theme of the objections i am not referring to china smaller countries brought up on heavy dose of non proliferation raised doubts indias impeccable record on non proliferation has been made clear
3301432 wherever we have talked individually they have understood india is unique in many ways we are hopeful of getting nsg clearance
3301433 we have no intention of breaking the moratorium unless circumstances compel us if circumstances compel whether 123 agreement existed or not we would do it because it is in our supreme national interest i think it is a non issue
3301434 and we recognise that if you do unilaterally test there will be international repercussions
3301435 the 123 contains provisions to discuss why you have tested is it because the security situation has undergone a change in this case the us has said that before ceasing cooperation they will examine why a particular thing was done

3301470 son majaderos que tratan de impedir el progreso y el desarrollo del pa s
3301471 ten an como finalidad fomentar tipos de cambio estables estimular el crecimiento del comercio mundial y facilitar la circulaci n internacional de capitales hubo una falta de atenci n casi inevitable a los intereses de los pa ses en desarrollo la mayor a de stos eran a n colonias y por lo tanto no estuvieron representados en bretton woods en general se soslay al tercer mundo y poco se tomaron en consideraci n sus intereses
3301472 el banco central de los estados unidos no tiene que defender el tipo de cambio del d lar los otros lo hacen en su lugar esto sigue siendo cierto en caso de d ficit del balance de pagos estadounidense absolutamente en caso de d ficit muy importante lo mismo en caso de d ficit ilimitado tambi n qu ocurre si los estados unidos est n en d ficit en primer lugar ellos pagan a sus acreedores en d lares mientras que los otros pa ses en general no pueden pagar con su moneda nacional pero esto no es lo importante si el acreedor exige que se le pague en marcos el banco estadounidense vender d lares contra marcos lo importante es que los d lares destinados a pagar el d ficit pesar n sobre el tipo de cambio d lar marco d lar yen d lar franco etc esta presi n bajar la cotizaci n del d lar por debajo de la paridad oficial y cuando se llegue al punto de intervenci n obligatoria del banco central interesado ste comprar d lares con su moneda nacional el d ficit estadounidense puede literalmente ser ilimitado por convenci n por regla de juego los d lares emitidos para financiarlo deben ser adquiridos a tipo de cambio fijo por los bancos centrales de los pa ses que tienen un excedente frente a los estados unidos
3301473 la creaci n de d lares est al servicio de la pol tica econ mica estadounidense sin tener en cuenta su impacto sobre las relaciones internacionales
3301474 si los estados unidos importan m s de lo que exportan es porque consumen m s de lo que producen gastando un ingreso que no han ganado es as como el pa s m s rico se alimenta del ahorro de los otros incluido el de los pa ses en v as de desarrollo cuando estos llegan a reembolsar una parte de su deuda

3301479 facilidades de crecimiento y de reducci n de la pobreza
3301480 la iniciativa para los pa ses pobres m s endeudados no se traducir por una reducci n nominal del valor de la deuda porque las quitas consistir n en lo esencial y donaciones destinadas a financiar el servicio de la deuda y no en reducciones directas de la deuda
3301481 la iniciativa dice eric toussaint consiste en disminuir un poco el peso de la deuda sobre las finanzas de los pa ses m s pobres a fin de que el sistema de la deuda perdure
3301482 puede ser perjudicial y en todo caso sucede con frecuencia que los beneficios los perciben los menos necesitados
3301483 la situation des enfants dans le monde 1989 se alaba
3301484 se puede estimar en por lo menos 500 000 la cantidad de ni os muertos en los ltimos doce meses como consecuencia de la desaceleraci n o de la inversi n del progreso econ mico en los pa ses en desarrollo
3301485 en el mundo en desarrollo mueren cada a o 12 2 millones de ni os de menos de cinco a os la mayor a de ellos por causas en muchos casos evitables por unos pocos centavos de d lar la pobreza ha sido y seguir siendo el mayor obst culo al desarrollo de la salud la pobreza es quiz s el principal determinante tomado aisladamente de la salud individual de la familia y de la comunidad la cantidad de gente pobre se ha incrementado substancialmente tanto en el mundo en desarrollo como entre los grupos y comunidades marginales del mundo desarrollado especialmente en los barrios pobres bidonvilles de las grandes ciudades
3301486 la creciente tendencia en muchas zonas a mantener a las ni as fuera de la escuela para que ayuden en las tareas de sus madres virtualmente asegura
3301487 es cada vez mayor el n mero de ni as que abandonan la escuela tanto primaria como secundaria o que no asisten a ella debido a la creciente pobreza
3301488 en el sector de la educaci n parece ser m s f cil durante el proceso de ajuste reducir el gasto p blico en el nivel primario que en el nivel superior
3301489 a largo plazo todo esto perjudicar gravemente la calidad de la educaci n

3301492 al fin del decenio el fmi y el banco mundial se convirtieron en beneficiarios netos de los recursos provenientes de africa encontr ndose en la situaci n anormal de socavar la viabilidad financiera de sus propias pol ticas de ajuste estructural
3301493 durante los nueve primeros meses de 1994 el franco cfa se desvaloriz alrededor del 33 en valor efectivo real grosso modo como estaba previsto los costos salariales expresados en d lares otro bar metro de la competitividad bajaron alrededor del 40 por ciento
3301494 un control m s estricto de los gastos p blicos
3301495 liberalizar el sistema de precios el mercado de trabajo y el comercio exterior
3301496 la comunidad internacional no puede mantener de manera permanente el nivel de ayuda actual
3301497 nosotros debemos asegurar nuestro acceso a los inmensos recursos naturales de africa
3301498 los incumplimientos por gobiernos extranjeros de su deuda externa son tan numerosos y ciertamente tan cercanos a ser universales que es m s f cil tratar sobre ellos nombrando a aqu llos que no han incurrido en incumplimiento que aqu llos que lo han hecho dem s de aquellos pa ses que incurrieron t cnicamente en incumplimiento existen algunos otros que pidieron prestado en el exterior en su propia moneda y permitieron que esa moneda se depreciara hasta menos de la mitad de su valor nominal y en algunos casos a una fracci n infinitesimal entre los pa ses que actuaron as cabe citar a b lgica francia italia y alemania
3301499 la insistencia en el cumplimiento de un convenio que supere la capacidad de pago de una naci n le servir a de justificaci n para negarse a cualquier arreglo nadie puede hacer lo imposible quienes insisten en cl usulas imposibles est n propiciando en ltima instancia el repudio completo de la deuda
3301500 ni los estados unidos ni ninguno de los estados reconocer n o pagar n deuda u obligaci n alguna que se haya contra do para ayudar a una insurrecci n o rebeli n contra los estados unidos estas deudas obligaciones y reclamaciones ser n consideradas ilegales y nulas
3301501 una extracci n de recursos tan cuantiosos de las naciones pobres por las naciones ricas obedece en definitiva a las condiciones de poder pero al final tiene un l mite la capacidad de pago del deudor y este concepto depende de una decisi n nacional lo que es esencial para el pueblo y para invertir no est disponible para transferirlo al exterior
3301502 es esencial para el pueblo y para invertir no est disponible para transferirlo al exterior

3301556 stop the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace
3301557 we can hardly agree with this because it would assume the presence of people described as georgian peacekeepers
3301558 they can no longer remain they brought shame upon themselves as peacekeepers they committed crimes

3301562 we are doing an analysis of these debt collection companies and find that they are more of a hindrance than assistance to municipalities

3301578 they always pass these authorizations with a lot of fanfare as if they are going to spend the money immediately but a lot of these bond bills are over five or ten years
3301579 there is the issue of giving false expectations that theyll be spent in the near term
3301580 you just cant keep spending and borrowing at that rate and expect that taxpayers are going to continue to pay higher taxes
3301581 borrowing so much that hes going to turn around and ask for a very large tax increase
3301582 the bonding is based very much on an affordability analysis
3301583 our capital plan is not a wish list there are some choices that we made

3301714 if allowed to stand this ruling will affect the rights of thousands of muslims and other religious and ethnic minorities in the united states
3301715 any law that does not allow for just compensation due to admittedly improper actions by a government agency must be challenged mr mahmud served his country with distinction and is only seeking fair treatment in asking the government to take responsibility for their mistake and adequately compensate him for the consequences of this mistake
3301716 at the time that the oberman revoked mahmuds hazardous materials endorsement oberman was well aware that mahmud had not engaged in any unlawful activity whatsoever oberman had no reasonable suspicion much less probable cause to believe that mahmud had engaged in any crime much less activity related to terrorism oberman had no reasonable suspicion much less probable cause to believe that mahmud was a threat to national security or posed any danger whatsoever to transportation security oberman was well aware that mahmud had never encouraged or engaged in any act of terrorism including the financial support of terrorism within or without the united states and was not a threat to national security or transportation security
3301717 the law did not provide any remedy for damages as a result of obermans behavior
3301718 a security threat pursuant to title 49 c f r 1572 107
3301719 basically it started with me being notified by tsa in a certified letter i got this letter stating that according to their findings i posed a national security threat
3301720 by posing a national security threat the hazardous materials endorsement on my cdl was revoked in that communiqu i was instructed to immediately surrender my cdl to the state that i lived in i had ten days to respond
3301721 precludes individuals from holding a hazardous materials endorsement on a cdl if the tsa determines or suspects an individual of being to a threat to national security to transportation security or of terrorism
3301722 im just in a hold pattern waiting to find out exactly what ive done
3301723 in my life ive never been arrested never been indicted never been convicted of any crime
3301724 i served this country and risked my life to protect it i did three years in the marines honorably discharged
3301725 ive proven i can mesh with society i pay my taxes i vote i do everything a good citizen is supposed to do and this is how i am treated i truly dont understand how they determine who is a threat and who is not does my belief in god make you a threat to the united states
3301726 i know from a certified return receipt that tsa received my reply on august 11 that much is documented i have repeated called the office to no avail
3301727 i didnt smoke drink or use drugs so i had time to read at that time of growing social and political awareness in america i started to study about african history i learned that the majority of african people brought to this country were muslim i also discovered that christianity was not our religion it was a religion that was basically forced upon us as a result of being enslaved
3301728 and the fact that most of my african ancestors brought to this country were muslim there was a natural inclination that drove me to be like my african ancestors and if i was to truly follow their example i had to become muslim that was january 1974
3301729 i associate with members of sclc but im not a member im sure living in the south ive had the opportunity to associate with people who are in the klan or the nazi party but im not a member of either of those parties either
3301730 totally cleared of any allegations and charges that have been lodged against me because they are totally unfounded theyve tsa ruined my reputation i am unemployed my employer stepped away from me based on the fact that i got this letter from tsa i think in the future i may be unemployable by the fact that this stench is attached to my name
3301731 when the letter arrived i thought this has got to be a mistake
3301732 determines or suspects of being a threat to national security transportation security or terrorism
3301733 it has been determined that the materials relied upon in making the initial determination contains information that cannot be released to you

3301866 i wish more people in the u s believed in us like we believed in us now i hope more people realize the u s is a force to be reckoned with
3301867 all these years there was only one gold medal for us in team final in sydney in athens we wanted to have some result unfortunately we fell
3301868 this gold medal is good recognition of six persons efforts each had to do his utmost
3301869 no i was not scared going last on high bar because all my big brothers had a big performance
3301870 i really relaxed did my routine and felt no pressure
3301871 ive never played singles at the olympics so this has been really cool for me
3301872 every time i walk out there its like im playing in my match but at the same time i have the whole u s team on my side its good i really like that feeling
3301873 obviously its a long ways away but the third round makes it closer im really excited for both of us to be playing really well for the u s
3301874 its hard to train for singles and always dealing with swelling ive just really been playing careful with it i really wanted to be here in whatever capacity it was and it became painfully obvious to me that role was doubles i was very happy to accept that and move forward
3301875 but with the time difference im still waking up like at 5 in the morning so its good i like the early matches
3301876 my way of improving on it is to keep it up
3301877 i played really clean matches in the past the next one would be kind of streaky i dont want to do that any more i just want to keep playing the same consistency
3301878 i felt like any time that i needed to serve well i did if i was down love 30 or a 30 all point

3301884 for me life will go on as usual but i sincerely hope olympic sports get a leg up its not a priority back home and i hope more focus is paid to these events like shooting
3301885 i entered the final as fourth which means i had to go all out for it thats why i was so aggressive and it paid off in the end i guess it was my day
3301886 i worked hard left home and trained in germany it only proves that if you keep working hard you would have your day someday and fortunately it was my day today

3301965 the rapid spread of the programs has turned overdrafts and the fees that come with them into one of the largest sources of profit for banks according to consultants and statistics compiled by government bank regulators washington mutual the nations seventh largest financial institution and the largest to promote overdraft protection charged customers more than an estimated 1 billion in overdraft fees last year
3301966 some banks are looking at the fact that some consumers barely make it from pay day to pay day and have a very low balance and instead of offering them a beneficial service they are charging their customers bounced check fees to take advantage of the situation

3301972 and were excited to introduce our award winning voiceengine to the increasingly popular iphone application development community
3301973 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3301974 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3301975 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3301976 the advance casts doubts on russias claim that this five day war is just a peacekeeping operation
3301977 this war is all about russia and the message russias sending to the world this is putins announcement that russia is back as a great power
3301978 we have to understand these russian troops didnt materialize out of nowhere
3301979 this is the culmination of putins efforts to pull georgia back within russias sphere and exert control over it
3301980 i am getting a little bit sick and tired of what were seeing a battle of words from left and right
3301981 i have reached a decision to halt the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace
3301982 the aggressor has been punished and has incurred very significant losses its armed forces are disorganized
3301983 it is not part of our culture it is not what we do

3301985 the hydraulics failed they were about to land then all these alarms went off because the hydraulics had failed on one side of the plane they had to fly all the way back to zurich with the landing gear extended and land there it was a very rough landing and it became chaos after that
3301986 all of my books are really romances typically love triangles
3301987 i was driving home in the middle of the night after having been to my fathers house in the mountains i began to imagine the story of someone probably a travelling salesman who had to travel a great deal periodically when he felt overwhelmed by the circumstances of his life he would park his car by the side of the road leave the headlights on walk a few paces in front of the car and then lie down as if he was the victim of an accident or a heart attack or a crime
3301988 he could have this enormous cathartic emotional outburst in their arms people would console him and tell him that everything was going to be all right that is what the story choke started as me in the dirt
3301989 the contrast between what i would have thought of this person had i seen him on the street and who he really was was so shocking it made me look at people in a different way and realise that seemingly the most boring person may have the most fascinating inner life
3301990 i have no idea what to say to people i have no idea how to be with people
3301991 so many author events can be boring and pretentious i really dont want those kids to be bored it is worth the effort to make the events crazy so that its more likely they will come back
3301992 my private history in terms of people in my life who are dead is very easy to discuss i dont feel those people can be threatened or intruded upon now but i am enormously protective of the people who are currently in my life my existing friends and family that is where the curtain is drawn
3301993 its about doing everything youve been taught to do as a child and then realising you dont know what to do next and also realising that those nice things youve been taught to do are only going to get you so far and unless you do something differently youre going to be that disappointed child for the rest of your life

3301997 this is more of a kick at the mayor by the governor
3301998 yes i know chicago is chicago and its a big city and mayor daley is the mayor there but im the governor of all of illinois
3301999 when communities are being dominated by gangbangers i think we have a responsibility to be as helpful as we can
3302000 youd have to strip some section of the state bare to provide enough state police to make any sort of impact
3302001 and its not like there are 200 300 sitting around a barracks somewhere waiting to get a call
3302002 if the idea was there is a need for more police theyd hire more chicago police officers

3302007 all the guys said hey we play nine in here
3302008 so if he was going to the bathroom he takes his jersey off to do it
3302009 we were coming off a couple of heartbreakers ourselves so i think guys were a little determined to finish this one
3302010 all the guys said hey we play nine in here
3302011 so if he was going to the bathroom he takes his jersey off to do it
3302012 we were coming off a couple of heartbreakers ourselves so i think guys were a little determined to finish this one
3302013 they always pass these authorizations with a lot of fanfare as if they are going to spend the money immediately but a lot of these bond bills are over five or ten years
3302014 there is the issue of giving false expectations that theyll be spent in the near term
3302015 you just cant keep spending and borrowing at that rate and expect that taxpayers are going to continue to pay higher taxes
3302016 borrowing so much that hes going to turn around and ask for a very large tax increase
3302017 the bonding is based very much on an affordability analysis
3302018 our capital plan is not a wish list there are some choices that we made
3302019 we can even speed it up if things get really great or slow it down if we hit a wall
3302020 parents experience lower levels of emotional well being less frequent positive emotions and more frequent negative emotions than their childless peers
3302021 in fact no group of parents married single step or even empty nest reported significantly greater emotional well being than people who never had children its such a counterintuitive finding because we have these cultural beliefs that children are the key to happiness and a healthy life and theyre not
3302022 if you admit that kids and parenthood arent making you happy its basically blasphemy
3302023 from baby lotion commercials that make motherhood look happy and well rested to commercials for disney world where youre supposed to feel like a kid because youre there with your kids weve made parenthood out to be one blissful moment after another and its disappointing when you find out its not
3302024 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3302025 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3302026 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3302027 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3302028 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3302029 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3302030 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3302031 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3302032 joss is a big supporter of barack obama and was very excited to be asked to do this for him he sent a personal message asking her to get on board

3302061 we can even speed it up if things get really great or slow it down if we hit a wall
3302062 depending on what happens in 2009 it could be a cause for concern
3302063 your revenues are declining and then youre carrying more debt so they need to be careful

3302068 a formal sale offer has been signed with a university in shanghai
3302069 its an olympic games pains irrelevant ive trained for so many years for this
3302070 my coach gave me a slap too anything to take the pain away from my back
3302071 its just the drive that got me through i suppose
3302072 ive had scans and everything it was decided that competing would cause no further damage
3302073 i struggled i had a back injury coming into the competition
3302074 if the situation had been different i would probably have pulled out a couple of weeks ago but there was nobody to replace me
3302075 i just tried to dig deep and get through the training so i could make it to beijing
3302076 i was in some discomfort in training and only managed to snatch up to 75kg in training and only clean and jerked 85kg

3302137 any side that makes the top eight can beat anyone in the top eight the only difference is that probably melbourne and manly have been very consistent as far as their season is concerned that doesnt mean anything when it comes to a one off game in a playoff
3302138 the only bonus for the top four obviously is the first home semi and playing melbourne in a phone box thats a definite advantage for them
3302139 if they run eighth i wouldnt really want to play them if i ran first
3302140 theyre right up there the sides weve played recently have all been big physical sides in melbourne canberra and the knights very similar
3302141 four big games and four sides coming into the finals who probably think that they can beat us
3302142 its a good test for us if were good enough to make the eight

3302151 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3302152 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3302153 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3302154 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3302155 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3302156 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3302157 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3302158 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3302159 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3302160 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3302161 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

3302164 it is a carefully done study that strongly confirms the relationship between salt and hypertension high blood pressure
3302165 the power of this study is that it includes a very large cohort
3302166 the study clearly showed that people who had elevated salt intake were the ones who had high blood pressure that was independent of the genotype for this specific gene
3302167 it is clear that this is the tip of the iceberg
3302168 the hypothesis they tested was reasonable but they only tested one gene
3302169 the vast majority of the people we know who have high blood pressure do not carry a gene that we know of
3302170 you cant worry about your genotype because you cant do anything about it
3302171 this study reaffirms that salt intake has a significant effect on blood pressure and that is clearly something that you can control
3302172 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country

3302181 the development of compound eye based miniature cameras and optical sensors could stimulate applications in automobile engineering credit cards security and surveillance displays and medical technology
3302182 we can work with infrared transparent materials such as chalcogenide glasses to produce infrared microlenses and visible laser hardened infrared sensors as well as photodiodes solar sensors solar concentrators photonic crystals optical bioprobes and so on

3302263 my son called from college and it was not to ask for money
3302264 instead he asked me to check out the anti plagiarism site where he was required to turn in his papers
3302265 my epiphany came when my son told me im tired of competing against professional writers
3302266 he was right no student should have to compete against material that others cut and paste from the internet and submit as their own
3302267 i made many joyful discoveries a culture of implicit trust in my classrooms students rededicated to their writing credible high stakes writing assessments and grading as it should be stress free and focused on the writers thoughts and style
3302268 in three years i have never had a student push back about being caught i called one student to my desk and explained that id found plagiarism in his assignment he asked where i just spun my display around to show the color coded report his response was cool it was cool all right he was busted some kids start out thinking they can beat the system a misconception that disappears as the deterrent effect takes hold
3302269 they like going paperless and turnitin helps them to make a smooth transition to high school with their electronic writing portfolios intact
3302270 were excited to offer students even more ways to save
3302271 students can now find the best prices for an entire courselist at a time or search for either books to buy or rent they can even get cash back on their old textbooks via our new buyback marketplace where top rated bookstores compete to buy back students books for the highest prices you send your books to the highest bidder and receive a check within a few days

3302337 el efecto ladrillo no es tan efecto aqu en euskadi como lo es en el estado espa ol
3302338 es ah donde el psoe sigue teniendo una deuda pendiente para con la sociedad vasca
3302339 el pse es una sucursal del psoe no va a hacer nada que no cuente con el visto bueno previo del psoe el pse lo que en todo caso deber a hacer es cumplir su palabra dada en el a o 1995 en el parlamento vasco cuando aprob por unanimidad con el resto de formaciones pol ticas el informe de prioridades de todas las materias pendientes de trasferencia en el estatuto de autonom a de gernika

3302349 sobre la base de su informe he tomado la decisi n de poner fin a la operaci n para forzar a las autoridades georgianas a la paz

3302353 wir werden in diese richtung auch keinen zweiten versuch unternehmen da wir schon einmal gefragt haben es ist alles ausgereizt jetzt m ssen andere spieler in die bresche springen
3302354 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3302355 the rescue team was formed after the government realised that the operation was not going according to plan
3302356 he moved to an unknown destination and we have not been able to trace his whereabouts
3302357 speech technology has reached a critical turning point where it is now fundamentally changing the way that we interact with the world around us
3302358 youre looking at a cinematic device employed by zhang yimou here this is actually almost animation a footstep a second 29 in all to signify the 29 olympiads
3302359 we said earlier that aspects of this opening ceremony are almost like cinema in real time well this is quite literally cinematic
3302360 this is a digitally manufactured shot to represent whats happening right now outside the stadium
3302361 you assume theres a large amount of intelligence in the viewing audience so when they see those twice an hour time stamps theyll understand what is being presented
3302362 the closer together the hairs the more pressure the bubble can withstand before collapsing
3302363 we were surprised by the fact that in some cases bugs may be unable to survive in shallow water but we did discover they can safely dive as deep as 30 metres
3302364 body weight maintenance is made up of three basic stages
3302365 in the first stage the brain receives sensory input from the body including information provided by circulating hormones such as leptin and ghrelin and from fuels such as glucose and fatty acids
3302366 it is well known that agrp agouti related protein neurons play a critical role in feeding and energy balance regulation
3302367 however the deletion of agrp and npy two neuropeptides released from the agrp neurons produces little metabolic effect
3302368 the mice with agrp neuron specific disruption of gaba release were lean had higher energy expenditure and showed resistance to diet induced obesity
3302369 we also found that these animals showed reduced food intake response to the hormone ghrelin this suggests to us that the neurocircuit engaging gaba release from the agrp neurons mediates at least part of ghrelins appetite stimulating action
3302370 as these new findings demonstrate gaba release is an important component that mediates the function of agrp neurons
3302371 discoveries such as this will ultimately help us to design an efficient strategy to tackle the current epidemic of obesity and metabolic disease
3302372 we are best at discriminating the facial features that are typical of our neighbors and if they happen to be parrots we become very good at recognizing individual birds
3302373 ultimately we are interested in what happens in a natural environment
3302374 but some questions require more control over the properties of visual stimuli than a picture of a natural scene would allow
3302375 the response of individual neurons can be strongly influenced by simple stimuli in the surround of the receptive field a phenomenon known as contextual modulation
3302376 context is an important part of how we perceive visual stimuli
3302377 and these results show how individual neurons might adjust their properties in different natural environments such as on a beach or in a forest

3302379 but the real signal came out with some of the northerly species that are more common in canada and the northern part of the u s their southern range boundaries are actually moving northward as well at a much faster clip
3302380 there are a wide spectrum of changes that are occurring and those changes are occurring in a relatively short amount of time were not talking centuries were talking decades
3302381 new york citizens need to recognize that these changes are occurring
3302382 whether they are good or bad whether they should be addressed whether we should adapt to them whether we should try to mitigate some of this those are questions that really rightfully belong in the political arena
3302383 what you begin to see is a systematic pattern of these species moving northward as we would predict with regional warming
3302384 creating the next generation of sophisticated technologies requires long term vision and collaboration with world class innovators
3302385 joint ph d projects and research contracts as well as teaching services from senior disney researchers will arise from the partnership in addition to the joint intellectual properties and patents that will result from our research
3302386 a unique opportunity with enormous potential for all participating parties to be chosen as the european loca tion for disney research is further proof of eth zurichs excellent international reputation and the quality of our research and development in this case in information technology and visual computing
3302387 we have the physical system were taking flow measurements of actual swimmers and were getting more information than anyone has ever had before about swimming and how the swimmer interacts with the water and so far these techniques have contributed to some very significant improvements in the lap times of olympic swimmers
3302388 this project moved the swimming world beyond the observational into scientific fact
3302389 the knowledge gained gave me the foundation for which every technical stroke change in preparation for the beijing olympics was based
3302390 to see how a swimmers motion affects the flow you need to know how much force the swimmer is producing and how that force impacts the water
3302391 swimming research has strived to understand water flow around a swimmer for decades because how a swimmers body moves the surrounding water is everything
3302392 the ability to measure flow and forces in a natural and unimpeded environment hasnt been available until recently and dr weis technology and methods presented usa swimming with a unique opportunity that united states swimmers and coaches could learn a lot from
3302393 how often does a researcher get to do something like this
3302394 its been a journey into a world that someone like me would have never before gotten the privilege to see first hand
3302395 its everyones dream to make a difference and im excited to keep helping the team for as long as they need me
3302396 wouldnt you really like to travel or would not want a new cool car

3302398 the popularity of the iphone along with the emergence of various applications and faster connectivity makes it an ideal platform for developing applications that incorporate quality real time voip
3302399 we are excited to enable the iphone with voip capabilities and lead the mobile communications market with our voice processing technology
3302400 with gips voiceengine mobile we are providing the capabilities that turn voice into ip packets so they can be transmitted via wi fi making it easier for applications developers to come to market quickly with integrated voip applications
3302401 and were excited to introduce our award winning voiceengine to the increasingly popular iphone application development community

3302403 lho incontrato in aeroporto a valencia lui e gli altri calciatori valenciani della nazionale spagnola per dire hanno viaggiato in classe economica quando a madrid sono saliti in aereo c stato un timido applauso cosa che mi ha fatto capire che si trattava di qualcuno famoso e nessuno li ha pi disturbati una volta atterrati hanno aspettato come tutti i poveri diavoli il loro bagaglio e tu mi insegni che non si tratta solo di soldi perch mi risulta che i calciatori spagnoli guadagnino quanto e forse di pi degli italiani un altro mondo quando penso agli idioti italiani che fanno fatica a firmare autografi poi s vero che non pareva troppo entusiasta di fare la foto con me
3302404 i gave iron horse almost 2 years notice on this so they have had many months to plan for the future and they have done a great job of it they will be out with plenty of new bikes in 2009 and 2010 dont you worry
3302405 the folks at iron horse share my vision for building bikes with real proven suspension technology rather then concocting some gimmick to market for another few years before the next new gimmick
3302406 ellsworth and iron horse agree that the sport of mountain biking grows when folks have a fabulous ride experience on great performing frame designs ict equipped full suspension designs perform better have more energy and great comfort traction and control then any other suspension design
3302407 we believe folks having that level of experience will ride more and tell a friend and there will be more folks riding bikes promoting health and appreciating our planet in an environmentally responsible and healthy way
3302408 this is a very exciting time for our product development department we are looking forward to creating unique frame platforms that carry forward iron horses renowned ride characteristics the goal is to incorporate the key qualities from our existing models with benefits of the ict system
3302409 we are committed to produce well engineered world cup quality performance bikes

3302414 the financing closing will be consummated in guyana via its guyanese subsidiary that will be executing the project on behalf of adua
3302415 stop the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace
3302416 we can hardly agree with this because it would assume the presence of people described as georgian peacekeepers
3302417 they can no longer remain they brought shame upon themselves as peacekeepers they committed crimes

3302431 i have never conceived that if i would be called upon to serve my country in the most minor of capacities i would refuse
3302432 i actually felt that there were benefits to be gained from the epa at least that was how it was put over by the people from the crnm i feel the government needs to be more specific in telling us where and how we would lose
3302433 the signatories have been spelt out very clearly on the cariforum side just as they have been spelt out very clearly on the european side so if there is a change in that it means that the whole documentation has to be reverted to the european council and that will take quite some time because you dont convene it at the snap of the finger so if im correct it means that this can hold up the entire process
3302434 i see no reason why guyana will not sign because it is in the interest of all those industries to have epa market access
3302435 who had stood by us in the bad days of lom and said we will sign up with the eu now the eu is going around hitting these countries over their heads with the caribbean signatures
3302436 the difference however is that we are the only ones to have concluded a full epa all the others concluded interims it is not that they strategised that they were limiting themselves to an interim its that they had not done the work to conclude a full epa we had done the work
3302437 the europeans do it all the time they initial they pause they review they come back they regroup they re argue what has happened to us that we have lost that capacity to manoeuvre why are we playing the european game
3302438 not a single caribbean president or prime minister has put his hand on his heart and said this is good for me they have all said we know this is not good enough but we dont think we could have done better its a bad agreement but its better than no agreement
3302439 any trade agreement we conclude after this with any country or group of countries in the context of free trade they will demand and we cannot deny similar treatment to europe so we are concluding an agreement with the world and were concluding a bad agreement with the world
3302440 much has happened since the last quarter of 2007 to cause us to rethink this proposed agreement and it is timely for the caribbean nations to engage their populations with the prospective outcome of this proposed protocol
3302441 our family deserved same but until now no one has been charged and we have no hope that we will ever get justice
3302442 but i dont think that anyone would be charged and i believe that they wilfully not pursuing the matter because it seems as though who pays the piper will call the tune
3302443 not of the opinion that the actual programme itself reflects a suitable input from the government of guyana we questioned the absence of our integral involvement and we would not be participating

3302454 taggers are good at characterizing material in ways that search
3302455 the east west energy corridor and turkey being an energy hub for the west is one of the principal arguments of turkey in its application for the eu and the need to have a good relationship with turkey
3302456 this conflict casts a shadow over turkeys foreign policy platform of creating an area of stability
3302457 this conflict could strengthen the argument for the west that if turkey is outside the tent it could create a lot of difficulties for the eu
3302458 so from the eu point of view it would make sense to bring turkey into the tent
3302459 there is also a concern that if turkey is part of the eu you are bringing the eus border to georgia and to the rest of the caucasus which might not go well in continental europe
3302460 we want stability in the region and to see fighting stop as soon as possible there is fire in the neighbours house
3302461 this is a threat faced by officers in prisons from across the country this is why the prison service is preparing direct intervention if ever a prison officer is taken hostage

3302471 web 2 0 has been hyped a lot to the extent that many investors view it as a bubble but in most cases it has not delivered tangible business value

3302477 although there are some technical irregularities funcinpec party publicly supports and accepts the temporary results of the election
3302478 both inflation and economic activity in general have eased which provide a better macroeconomic environment for a loosening of policies
3302479 the country should make efforts to secure steady and comparatively fast economic growth
3302480 not only for this year but also for the next few years
3302481 the decline in consumer price inflation was mainly driven by falling food price inflation as food supply increased
3302482 in our view inflation should decline further over the rest of the year
3302483 producer price figures showed costs pressures remained quite big while consumer price figures showed price rises on the consumption side have eased
3302484 we read a lot of stuff people say about us and it gets us fired up so many articles said the u s team was not going to make it to team finals or if they do there would be no chance of a medal
3302485 anything that got thrown at this team we rolled with it we never counted us out we never doubted ourselves i guess that were all first time olympians we never counted ourselves out
3302486 i knew if i tried my best id win it
3302487 so far this is the highlight but i hope theres more to come
3302488 it feels awesome i was actually glad to have made the final for the first time after missing out at sydney and athens so to win the gold is amazing
3302489 the big guns were out there you try not to look but i knew they were not missing many
3302490 mortgage lending activity remains relatively weak and will decline further in the coming months as a result of funding constraints and lower consumer demand
3302491 the majority of lending continues to be to people with larger deposits which is prudent for borrowers and lenders in a slowing housing market
3302492 the authorities could shift their focus to growth from fighting inflation
3302493 i think he performed well today though he didnt get a gold medal
3302494 since he has participated in four games a bronze medal is an historical breakthrough for him
3302495 i am confident of bringing back two gold medals at the games
3302496 i will work hard on every dive instead of caring too much about results
3302497 ive decided to finish the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace the safety of our peacekeeping forces and civilian population has been restored
3302498 the aggressor has been punished having sustained considerable losses its armed forces have been disorganised
3302499 should centres of resistance or other aggressive attempts arise you must take the decision to destroy them
3302500 securing funding represents a major challenge to many young sportspeople particularly at the critical stage of trying to break into the international arena
3302501 as a local company dale farm are delighted that through this bursary we are helping dedicated young local sports stars of the future to cover some of the associated training costs and expenses by providing them with some much needed assistance which will help propel them onto the international competitive circuit
3302502 the substantial bursary of 5 000 offered by dale farm could potentially be used to cover a years worth of training including travel expenses to competitions
3302503 based on our positive experience to date we would encourage other local businesses to pick up the torch and do what they can to support local sporting talent
3302504 i would have to say my debut which was against uruguay and our euro 2008 qualifier at home against spain
3302505 i think you always remember your debut and for me it was a great honour to get called up into the senior squad
3302506 our 3 2 win over spain at windsor park was certainly a night to remember we had been beaten in the first game of the campaign against iceland and i think a lot of people thought we didnt have a chance against the spanish but we went out that night and proved ourselves and i also set up one of the goals it was definitely a memorable game for everyone
3302507 thanks to support of curtis cars toyota we are delighted to be co ordinating the clubs annual summer football tournament
3302508 over the past number of years the competition has went from strength to strength as local clubs recognise the tournament as a great opportunity to make final preparations for the new football season in a competitive fun and friendly environment
3302509 we have therefore been inundated with requests from clubs across the north west wanting to participate in this years competition and we are sure that this years tournament will prove to be our most successful summer football tournament yet
3302510 curtis cars has a strong tradition for supporting local community initiatives and we are delighted to extend this support to the east end youths annual summer football tournament with the tournament attracting 32 teams and over 300 children from across the north west in what is going to be action packed day we hope that all the children and their parents or guardians have a great day
3302511 low sales levels are not unexpected during july however continued uncertainty amongst potential buyers and difficulties that first time buyers are experiencing obtaining mortgage finance have resulted in the housing market being at a virtual standstill in many areas
3302512 indeed some agents are already reporting an increase in inquiry levels in some areas as many seek bargains
3302513 our door remains open to mortgage business and our network of mortgage advisers is readily available to discuss individual customer needs

3302524 he got entered into a draw and won two tickets so its been pretty cheap for us
3302525 we found a lot of the bands that we contacted really wanted to play belfast
3302526 the flaming lips have wanted to play for a number of years and for whatever reason havent made it
3302527 i think belfast is about to enter a really golden period for live music thats one of the things we wanted to reflect we wanted to do some of the best local bands that we thought fit the bill
3302528 if you want to be champion in any sport you have to make sacrifices and for example put your chosen activity ahead of your social life
3302529 sport northern ireland was delighted to afford this great opportunity to these talented athletes their parents or carers and their coaches
3302530 over the duration of this event the young participants undertook a range of challenges and exercises that will aid them in making key decisions as they approach an important transition stage in their sporting career
3302531 i found the three days really useful and i learned a lot of things that i didnt know before particularly in respect of the mental approach to sport
3302532 we have decided to support the impeachment motion in the interest of the democracy
3302533 my way of improving on it is to keep it up i just want to keep playing the same consistency
3302534 im not sure that i faced any breakpoints today so thats really good
3302535 thats good for me going on in the later rounds that im tough on my serve
3302536 i definitely feel more confident with every match that passes thats what winning does
3302537 obviously its a long way away but the third round makes it closer im really excited for both of us to be playing really well for the us then trying to play great doubles today too
3302538 es ist nur noch eine frage der zeit bis wir auch k hlschr nke und unterw sche verkaufen
3302539 it is so clear what is happening we are in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country we are in the process of the destruction of world order as it was established after the end of the cold war
3302540 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening the georgian capital tblisi
3302541 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3302542 would be inconsistent with assurances that we have received from russia that its objectives were limited
3302543 all the russian troops who arrived by ship have crossed over to zugdidi
3302544 the city is deserted but there are no russians here
3302545 its not south ossetia only but the whole of georgia
3302546 we heard statements saying that the russian railroad troops that entered abkhazia a couple of months ago were there for a humanitarian mission now we know the truth these forces were there to aid a russian invasion
3302547 there is a clear responsibility on the russian government to bring this conflict quickly to an end
3302548 a formal sale offer has been signed with a university in shanghai
3302549 quemar los autos estacionados en la puerta de la escuela
3302550 maybe venezuela could afford to spend some on new uniforms theyre certainly going old skool
3302551 thats a little too much high fiving for a team that is trailing 11 23 i might say if i were them id probably be a little more into the game
3302552 negotiations with the palestinians are making progress on a number of subjects particularly borders
3302553 these negotiations are serious and are aimed at a common objective
3302554 given that the nc is adamant to allowing us to have the defence ministry in a government led by us we talked with the cpn uml about ways to find solutions to this state of deadlock and we even urged the cpn uml to lead the government if they wish to
3302555 both the cpn m and nc have urged us to lead the next government but we are stressing forming a national consensus government incorporating at least four major parties
3302556 she held her hand firmly and kept pulling her closer
3302557 when i gave the ice cream to the child she stood frozen the lady took it in her place
3302558 normally a happy child always takes the ice this was not a normal situation
3302559 the little girl looked healthy but very sad she had her eyes towards the floor and was too shy to look up
3302560 the lady asked her in a mixture of french and english what she wanted
3302561 the girl answered in english she looked up for only a second with an unhappy face and said chocolate please then she looked down again
3302562 there is reluctance in my heart as i know there is in the other senators to contemplate the use of force
3302563 we were simply left with no other credible alternative to protect the safety and well being of the american people
3302564 in my view he would contradict if not undermine the obama message of change turning a new page on foreign policy and national security
3302565 senator bayh has shown the judgment that we need to admit that mistakes were made and we need to learn from them
3302566 we are not going to get into which particular person is good or bad
3302567 we hope that emphasizing senator obamas judgment against the war is something they consider in making their pick
3302568 he has got hollywood good looks and he speaks well he would be very loyal
3302569 i think evans real strength is you get someone on the ticket who has a record of being strong on national security and that is a very important quality to have
3302570 nyi pu was taken from his home early tuesday morning
3302571 police said they want to question him but it is not clear what they want to know
3302572 in several areas mud and rocks from the mountains have buried entire villages
3302573 the search effort has been difficult because we dont have equipment and the digging has to be done manually
3302574 we are trying our best but we really think they have all died their bodies might be buried below the rubble and they could even have been swept away down the red river
3302575 thirteen dead bodies and 15 injured have now been brought here
3302576 so far according to my information it was a security vehicle and an ied improvised explosive device was planted under the bridge
3302577 the flawed internal and external policies of his dictatorial regime have resulted in the large scale murder of innocent people of our province and fata federally administered tribal areas
3302578 it shows that if you protect these animals then they can recover
3302579 im encouraged by the fact that several of the large whale species that had been in trouble for a long time have shown steady increases over recent decades
3302580 humpbacks have really shown an ability to recover strongly from extremely intensive hunting
3302581 it takes a while for conservationists to build up the confidence that it is a real signal of recovery and not a short term variation
3302582 it is a political question and it will be answered in a political form
3302583 i think it is really important to stress that the red list is not about whether a given species can be exploited
3302584 its simply about looking at the status of these animals and giving people some idea where they are now in relation to where they used to be
3302585 the trouble is that the nets that cause the most trouble the entangling nets that are unselective in what they catch are still being used
3302586 i think we are just seeing the start of the effects of climate change in the oceans another big problem is noise from sonar which we dont fully understand yet
3302587 preventing deliberate harm of that species has been ongoing for nearly a century and has been pretty effective
3302588 but the numbers that are killed in ship strikes and become entangled in lines from lobster and crab traps are preventing the population which is not very big in the first place recovering
3302589 how you stop or reduce that is a real challenge
3302590 the data deficient category is pretty large for cetaceans probably surprisingly large to many people
3302591 it is the species that live far offshore that are found in less developed parts of the world that in many cases we dont have a clue about how many there are
3302592 an elderly couple and their adult son were killed by the rebels
3302593 houses have been razed and scattered gun fire and mortar shelling is still going on as the rebels retreat
3302594 the refugee crisis is an unacceptable cost of the governments mismanagement of the peace process a peace process should lead to the protection of life and property and yet whats happening is the opposite
3302595 the un world food programme is gravely concerned about the humanitarian situation in north cotabato province
3302596 it is essential that appropriate relief supplies are despatched urgently and distributed to the affected populations most of whom are now in evacuation centres which are overflowing
3302597 i am happy to be in makassar it is a friendly and peaceful place

3302603 jyotish prasad and ashish kumar for the offence of brutal murder of the australian tourist you be hanged till death
3302604 the victim in the present case was a foreigner lady who was totally dependent on the hospitality provided to her by our people she was totally defenceless and unprotected
3302605 the victim was of such an age that she should have been seen by the convicts as a motherly figure
3302606 you only want to do businesses where there is a growing large number of ccies
3302607 the ccie program is an individual program a company might sponsor you but it is up to the individual to attain the ccie certification no small feat
3302608 if you are going to attempt the ccie you have to have a compelling reason market opportunity etc
3302609 if you do attain your ccie you must have a revenue source to maintain the ccie or why care to re sit for the written exam every two years
3302610 cisco is the worldwide leader in networking second place is so far behind well you get the picture
3302611 as the internet grows and we see moores law impact our global village more and more the winners and losers are in africa are not staying up
3302612 look at the bad boy countries and you will not see any ccies
3302613 look at dictators or countries that are nationalizing their business and you see the drop again
3302614 the world is flat with opportunities everywhere but more everywhere in countries with high growing ccie counts
3302615 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3302616 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3302617 which of the two major candidates do you think will do the least damage to liberty in america if elected president
3302618 this is a good deal for construction crews members and for the film industry

3302621 na mijn toespraak weet ik nu perfect wie zal blijven vechten voor de club of wie zal afhaken de manier waarop ik de spelers toesprak is hier van geen tel de groep moet begrijpen dat inzet een eerste vereiste is ook al draait alles in de soep ik ga er dan ook van uit dat we deze moeilijke tijden zonder boetes kunnen overwinnen
3302622 het was de eerste keer dat ik herman zo woedend heb gezien de muren hebben hier echt getrild alles wat er spaak loopt hebben we overlopen het kan echt zo niet verder een zes op zes tegen cercle en aa gent is dan ook een must

3302627 the uk economy is in sound shape strong market fundamentals a structural housing supply shortage and pent up demand from a large number of potential first time buyers will support house prices preventing a sustained and significant fall
3302628 i was coming out of my hotel room one day and i see this cd in my post and take it which i never do
3302629 i heard the first song and said thats it thats going to be the opening track and it says the word barcelona many times
3302630 it was about my relationship with the city what it provoked
3302631 since i was a child i had always wanted to live in a caravan but couldnt because i failed my driving license five times
3302632 i take an amplifier to the flea markets and sing in the street
3302633 one time i was flying to barcelona and my bag was badly overweight so i dressed all the girls in the queue in my clothes
3302634 if you dont keep your computer up to date it is easier for a piece of malicious software known as malware to install itself and transfer data from your computer over the web for estate agents and their staff that is a very worrying prospect
3302635 updates for programs such as web browsers are released a couple of times a year and are mostly free to download and use its remembering to do it where most companies go wrong
3302636 the answer is not to ban staff from using the internet at work
3302637 we recommend every agency gives someone specific responsibility for keeping their computers web browsers up to date or hire in it experts to keep them protected

3302663 door uit te roepen dat de kaukasus een regio duizenden kilometers verwijderd van het amerikaanse continent tot haar invloedssfeer behoort heeft de vs een grote blunder begaan
3302664 natuurlijk heeft iedereen belang bij vrede in de kaukasus iedereen met een beetje gezond verstand weet dat rusland met de regio is verbonden door een gemeenschappelijke geografie en een eeuwenlange geschiedenis
3302665 zouden nooit een militair offensief hebben durven lanceren zonder het gevoel te hebben dat zij gesteund en aangemoedigd worden door een grotere krijgsmacht

3302670 the two governments are concerned about the affairs at rvr the concession is not working as expected and is a great threat to our economies
3302671 this kind of situation is unacceptable and a solution must be found immediately if the concession is to be salvaged
3302672 if these resolutions do not work within the stipulated time frame then the two governments will be forced to review the concession

3302684 somewhere out there in that chaos of darkness and light of science and protons of gods and stars and death somewhere theres an answer
3302685 i can lock you up without evidence and you wont see a lawyer for two years
3302686 when i was in the math club we always used to say dont judge a geek by his glasses
3302687 i can lock you up without evidence and you wont see a lawyer for two years
3302688 when i was in the math club we always used to say dont judge a geek by his glasses
3302689 it would not surprise me at all if this were to occur
3302690 yes we have no experience with athletes here but the treatment is safe and we can help you
3302691 it strengthens lung function and stem cells go into the bloodstream and reach the organs it takes two weeks i recommend four intravenous injections 40 million stem cells or double that the more the better we also use human growth hormones but you have to be careful because they are on the doping list
3302692 i dont know how it was arranged or what level of hospital this was but it supports the idea that the world of athletics is very aware of gene doping and already pursuing it
3302693 there are interesting preliminary results but i cant expand on that
3302694 but were all encouraged by the results and wada very much wants to be ahead of the curve on this and has funded a dozen or more labs on gene doping
3302695 this is all very subjective but the hope is that it will be a fair process that will allow the athlete who has had gene therapy for legitimate reasons to state his or her purpose for it
3302696 the sporting authorities can then either accept or reject it
3302697 if gene doping is happening already as we suspect its being done unethically and with immature
3302698 there must be pockets of residents that have some kind of a characteristic that is contributing to a higher infant mortality whether thats substance abuse or something else
3302699 i just cant tell you because we havent done that specific of an analysis
3302700 see if there is anything that might suggest an environmental exposure
3302701 the parents knew this was going to happen but said we want to get to know her before she goes
3302702 standing on the sidelines you just go i dont know if i would have the same toughness
3302703 even though many clinic patients dont have insurance we have pulled together community partnerships to make sure they get everything insured women would get
3302704 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
3302705 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3302706 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
3302707 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
3302708 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
3302709 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about
3302710 to spooks what torchwood is to doctor who ie not as good
3302711 so we will never again be faced with the situation where one state fails to pass on information to another and a doctor who is not practising well or who is practising beyond his or her level of accreditation will be pulled up very very quickly and wont be able to be employed in another jurisdiction
3302712 before the end of the year queensland will introduce the first piece of legislation which all other states and territories will sign on to as the first step to establish a national registration scheme for doctors and other allied health professionals including nurses
3302713 so were getting to the sharp end of the development of the national registration system to be up and running by the middle of the 2010
3302714 it was agreed that queensland would be the host state which im particularly proud of
3302715 looked calm i think his balls were pretty much on time excellent accuracy
3302716 the signs i saw in the stands were very positive and encouraging
3302717 i think it hit him right between the 8 and 3
3302718 we throw that pass a lot it looked like it was right there
3302719 hes a bigger stronger guy than he was this time last year
3302720 double catch but james has those really good hands and hes a strong guy
3302721 the route progression wasnt what it was supposed to be you have to have the discipline to move on to the next receiver hell learn from that

3302728 its also frustrating that i havent been able to deliver what i know i can in the tournament because of the injury
3302729 it will be hard to watch but i know the boys can get the job done against ivory coast they are feeling confident
3302730 the boys are fresh and relaxed and they have taken a lot of confidence out of the game against argentina
3302731 up until now people thought that the tasmanian mega fauna had actually gone extinct before people arrived on the island
3302732 things were very climatically stable in that part of australia and yet the mega fauna still managed to go extinct
3302733 so its down to humans of one sort or another
3302734 a lot of people still have in their minds an axe wielding spear wielding people bloodthirsty out there slaughtering all over the place it wasnt like that at all
3302735 it was basically just one joey baby kangaroo in the pot for christmas and thats all youve got to go to do to drive slow breeding species to extinction
3302736 fedusa condemns the actions of the fist national bank fnb because we believe it is totally unacceptable that the bank can go and offer their client a mortgage bond offer in order to place the person in a position to go and look for a particular property on the market and then unliterary come and withdraw the offer
3302737 i can confidently say and theyd have to be on their top form if both of them are on top form they are potential medal winners
3302738 the two guys were out there for a few hours this morning they did three laps on their time trial bikes
3302739 all i remember is being on the ground and just glimpsing up and seeing that the ball was in the back of the net
3302740 and i think i then jumped up and ran around like a maniac
3302741 i dont mind who scores a goal just as long as somebody scores them and we come away with a win thats all that matters to me
3302742 i think were fitter than quite a few of the other teams
3302743 weve trained harder than i think we have in a long long time
3302744 weve been running exceptionally hard weve done a lot of heat chamber work you get to a second half like today and it all pays off

3302748 stop the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace
3302749 we can hardly agree with this because it would assume the presence of people described as georgian peacekeepers
3302750 they can no longer remain they brought shame upon themselves as peacekeepers they committed crimes
3302751 our troops are making advances we are hoping for success
3302752 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3302753 it is not in our tradition to topple anyone or put someone on a throne
3302754 lustig jetzt drehen sich alle kommentare nur um eine nebenbemerkung in meinem eintrag
3302755 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3302756 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3302757 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
3302758 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
3302759 it is all about projecting the right image of china with no respect for honesty or for the audience
3302760 i do not think the chinese state realises how unethical this is they dont understand what kind of values they are reflecting
3302761 regrettably the answer is that we didnt find any decrease of thick melanoma over the last decade
3302762 there was the possibility that early detection and greater public awareness may have had an impact on later development of thick melanoma but so far that is not the case
3302763 the problem is that it is often quite difficult to identify thick melanomas early on
3302764 they tend to have a nodular shape but dont necessarily stick out above the surrounding skin or have an irregular edge theyre not always dark either and can be quite pale and flat

3302802 there were a lot of strange faces people who arent regular customers
3302803 many were buying camping needs our sales and traffic wereup for sure its good for the local economy because if people come for the festival they might come back to the area
3302804 definitely more than usual at least 20 to 25 per cent busier a lot of the customers said they had been to the festival and were from out of town
3302805 we were up about 20 per cent especially saturday when people were here for the big bonnie raitt concert
3302806 three quarters of our customers were from out of town the festival put the area as an up and coming place to be

3302910 der fall der kaukasus republik ist ein warnsignal moskaus an den westen finger weg von unseren l ndereien denn nichts anderes ist georgien f r den kreml niemals werden die milit rs es zulassen dass ein land aus dem russischen einflussgebiet mitglied der nato wird die waghalsigen versprechungen von nato und europ ischer union lie en georgien berm tig werden viele bezahlen das jetzt mit ihrem leben

3302917 als demonstration der russischen gro macht verbunden mit der botschaft an hnlich unbotm ige nachbarn dass der westen im ernstfall zum zuschauen verurteilt bleibt
3302918 weil russland seine mittlerfunktion im kaukasus sp testens mit dem bergriff auf georgisches gebiet verspielt hat ist insbesondere die eu angehalten im ringen um eine s dossetische friedensmission mit nachdruck die russische f hrungsrolle in frage zu stellen um glaubw rdig zu bleiben sollte man moskau jedoch mit gut sortierten argumenten gegen bertreten dass im kaukasus einem demokratischen regime beistand im kampf gegen ein undemokratisches geb hrt geh rt nicht dazu zudem sollte man beim verweis auf georgiens staatliche souver nit t den pr zedenzfall kosovo zumindest im hinterkopf behalten

3302952 i went back inside to help people get out everybody was helping everybody working together to get these people out
3302953 i am so happy my dream to see india win an individual gold medal in the olympics before i die has been fulfilled
3302954 its a sudden thing with a shock wave large pieces of shrapnel and a fireball
3302955 there is a big lack of buying interest in gold
3302956 gold is going to have a hard time getting any sustainable traction to move higher
3302957 i think peoples expectations got too high because they began to believe that these prices couldnt drop and almost the beginning of bubble mentality had taken place over the last year or so
3302958 no one knows how far prices will drop but the fact the world economy is slowing is finally getting recognized in the marketplace
3302959 it has become clear that demand is cratering which is making it hard to rally
3302960 its hard to imagine that the market will shrug off the potential loss of 1 million barrels a day of pretty good quality crude but that appears to be the case
3302961 i think we are looking at a significant change in market sentiment
3302962 we are really only focusing on the bearish aspects of a dramatic slowdown in demand and increased supplies
3302963 there was a time when i probably did feel a little too much pressure
3302964 now ive embraced it it was one of the things dawn coe jones taught me after the first couple of canadian opens i played in people want you to do well theyre not trying to add to your pressure embrace it and use it to your advantage its like the senators playing at home they use it to their advantage ive learned to do that im looking forward to the tournament and coming to ottawa
3302965 when we were talking about where the tournament might go two things came to mind the hunt club in 94 and royal ottawa in 2000 i thought the fans in this city really came out to support us and i encouraged cn to come here
3302966 i knew how great this golf course was i knew the venue was big enough to host what they need on the corporate side and i figured the fans would come out in droves
3302967 we always have great crowds and theyre always pulling for the canadian players
3302968 for us the canadian players it feels like a major it doesnt need to be classified as a major by the lpga this tournament for me last year was my stepping stone because i finally broke into the top 10 i havent had a top 10 this year but ive played more consistently i just havent shot any really low numbers
3302969 i didnt know if my body was going to be able to do it
3302970 you feel helpless youre thinking what direction is this going to go its just such an unknown theres no certainties
3302971 when i told the physiotherapist yeah im going to be rowing again next year she said well dont count on it
3302972 to make food was a big deal to make a cup of coffee i would stand up grind the beans lie on the floor everything i did i had to stop and lay down
3302973 it was brutal after the olympics its natural to go through a depression but i just went into a serious funk that winter was the lowest time of my life by far
3302974 its really how much you have a desire to hurt how much you have a desire to be in a competitive environment
3302975 that hadnt gone away at all if anything i realized how much i missed that
3302976 it would be like hed fire up in front of me and id stick on his wheel and sprint past him at the end and hed be so mad
3302977 he just hates losing in any form whatsoever whether it be crib cribbage cycling or rowing
3302978 what finance does is give you the tools to use as a lens for interpreting whats going on in the world
3302979 its kind of like a big game in many ways its the most competitive and dynamic field there is
3302980 it will be holding the governments feet to the fire to ensure new brunswickers are getting what they pay for
3302981 there will be days where i wake up and wish i never appointed a health council and thats the reason i am appointing it because it will focus on some issues that might slip through the cracks that may be overlooked by the minister of the day or the regional health authorities
3302982 the health council will have the power of public influence they dont have any direct authority over the regional health authority shared services or any other sphere of health
3302983 the health council i have said repeatedly is the dark horse of this whole reform
3302984 we can put ourselves in a tight spot by ignoring the health council
3302985 people paid attention to the regional health authorities believing that the regional health authority were just large replicas of the previous health authorities
3302986 the regional health authorities are now for clinical delivery within budget the health council is the advocacy branch of this reform
3302987 they are not going to be hamstrung by bureaucracy and paths of reporting but they will be reporting to the media and public on a variety of issues
3302988 it will look into things here and there it will also look in to my requests and will make an annual report
3302989 its mandate letter is going to ensure the applicability of the official languages act throughout the health care system
3302990 the health council has complete discretion as to whether they feel that they should come down on one side of an argument or not
3302991 the fact is they will have im sure some concerns about policy development
3302992 the good news is that there may be still a possibility to move this forward and conclude these negotiations within the time frame which all the wto members had agreed since last year that is end 2008
3302993 im honored to know a person like tom ridge who had every opportunity after he graduated from harvard not to go to vietnam
3302994 he could have found a doctor that would have given a certificate that he had a bad knee but instead he went and decided to serve his country during the vietnam war and he came back here to erie
3302995 thats the kind of people that this part of america produces
3302996 call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking get him down there and get him to work
3302997 if you cast a universal net my name might be on the list
3302998 but as the list narrows i dont have a clue whos on and whos off i know one thing john will make a sound decision
3302999 we cant reprocess spent nuclear fuel we cant store spent nuclear fuel we cant compete with other countries we cant develop clean coal technology we can thats what americas thats the history of the united states of america we can and we will and sometimes it requires government assistance
3303000 right now clearly hes the underdog in private and public polls we know that
3303001 i dont want to hear all the political stuff the bickering
3303002 i want to hear obama and mccain both say how theyre going to solve problems
3303003 i tell you if tom runs for veep it is locked in
3303004 the mac 10 is not the weapon of choice but considered like a status symbol
3303005 only those with real money and prepared to get involved in real violence have access to these guns in my experience the vast majority have come from the briars gun factory
3303006 sufficient evidence between these weapons to demonstrate a common origin
3303007 however it was conceded there was no way to date dna and that it could have been transferred via another person to the bags
3303008 we are still searching and i think we are getting nearer something could be done before the weekend
3303009 if we do something it will probably be the only signing we make but i cant say for sure
3303010 it went alright but it could have been better as i went off key ive been practising hard as i have to write my own lyrics which doesnt take a long time its just rehearsing them
3303011 my audition went really well its the best ive danced in a while

3303014 not protect any person or entity through false information or omission
3303015 i have a question am i still allowed to vote
3303016 all i can say is that he will testify truthfully for whichever party asks him
3303017 all government is evil and trying to improve it is largely a waste of time
3303018 we believe any decision at this time on whether he should remain majority leader is premature and wrong
3303019 the problem is one that is quite serious across the state
3303020 were out of free fall but were not in an era when social capital has gone up
3303021 we really have to put it on the front burner when we get back no pun intended
3303022 he may only be about 5ft 6in or 5ft 7in but height is not everything
3303023 he is very fast and handles the puck with confidence and maturity
3303024 while tom was at st marys he played on the same line as two nhl draftees
3303025 hes been skating every summer in bracknell and you can see by the way he plays that he is something special
3303026 and he wont find the physical stuff a problem because that is what hes been used to in north america
3303027 he is keen to play on our powerplays and although i will probably start him on the third line just to get him used to the style of the league if he plays like i know he can he will feature on one of the top two lines
3303028 they will be far more physical and intense and that is what i am looking for from my team

3303073 ulama juga cenderung mengatakan yakjuj dan makjuj berasal dan dikurung di benua asia tengah berdasarkan tafsiran ayat ke 90 dari surah al khafi yang menyebutkan zulkarnain sampai ditempat terbit matahari iaitu timur dunia
3303074 cerita mengenai sejarah yakjuj dan makjuj tertera dalam al quran menerusi surah al kahfi ayat ke 92 hingga 98 manakala kebangkitan dinyatakan dalam surah an anbiyaa ayat ke96 dan 97
3303075 hingga apabila dibukakan tembok yakjuj dan makjuj dan mereka turun dengan cepat dari seluruh tempat yang tinggi dan sudah dekatlah kedatangan janji yang benar kiamat maka tiba tiba terbelahlah mata orang kafir mereka berkata aduhai celakalah kami sesungguhnya kami adalah dalam kelalaian mengenai ini bahkan kami adalah orang yang zalim
3303076 hadis riwayat imam ahmad pula menerangkan ciri fizikal yakjuj dan makjuj yang antara lain bermuka bulat dan kulit kekuningan seperti wajah kebanyakan penduduk asia tengah
3303077 allah akan mengizinkan tembok itu runtuh dan yakjuj dan makjuj bebas ke dunia manusia apabila hampirnya kiamat dan peristiwa itu menjadi satu daripada 10 tanda besar kiamat
3303078 nabi isa as memerintahkan manusia yang masih beriman berlindung di pergunungan bagi mengelak menjadi mangsa yakjuj dan makjuj baginda kemudian berdoa kepada allah swt dan allah membinasakan mereka dengan mengutuskan seekor burung besar untuk mengangkut dan membersihkan mayat itu daripada bumi

3303104 the icc sent us a request 10 days ago and said they would fund lawsons around 12 days trip to australia and new zealand
3303105 it is a very logical thing to do and hopefully it will assuage concerns of leading players and make up their minds to come here
3303106 i am quite impressed with the level of security in place
3303107 it is another matter to satisfy and improve the confidence of key players
3303108 lawson will join the task force later this week when the six member icc delegation visits australia and new zealand england captain kevin pietersen has also raised concerns over touring pakistan and logart said the icc task force will also be visiting england
3303109 we have got a series of visits that follow the pakistan evaluation
3303110 we go to australia and new zealand and speak to the cricket boards as well as the players association and to the players themselves and then visit england and lets see what comes out
3303111 it is a big challenge to convince the players its upon us to convey the message and to raise the confidence
3303112 what we have seen and experienced is that the security arrangements in place should be sufficient to have the event safe and secure
3303113 the eight nation champions trophy featuring defending champion australia south africa england new zealand west indies india sri lanka and pakistan will now be staged from sept 12 28
3303114 there were some advices from the security consultants that it might be better not to start the competition from sept 11
3303115 i thought it should have been a lot closer after the first round
3303116 i think the score was bad i think they were giving him a score for anything and i had to work to get all of my points i knew going in that the only way i could win this fight is dont let him hit me
3303117 im not saying he won but when youre chasing the bout you do things youre not comfortable with im not grouching here we lost fair and square but you saw it for yourselves
3303118 im very sad i thought i would be the winner i already beat him once before

3303131 we have no information suggesting theres any specific threat to the games

3303141 now and then you can sit somewhere and know they will just cross the road there but now and then they do unexpected things
3303142 males have a larger home range so they walk a lot longer distances each night to look for females
3303143 the females dont bother they just stay around and they know the males will get there
3303144 i think its important because hedgehogs are in decline at the moment and its nice to do something to find out what the reason is behind this decline
3303145 but if it had been rats i would eagerly have done rats
3303146 but i always say hedgehogs and badgers have always been around together so why do we suddenly see this big decline
3303147 i dont say badgers are not a reason for it i say theyre not the only reason for it

3303153 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
3303154 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
3303155 the chinese government puts people first and is dedicated to maintaining and promoting its citizens basic rights and freedom chinese citizens have freedom of religion these are indisputable facts as for the divergence on human rights and religions we always advocate both sides talk from a basis of mutual respect and equality to enhance understanding and diminish divergence and enlarge mutual consensus we firmly oppose any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs using human rights and religion and other issues
3303156 we think that it is unfortunate but its between this government and joey as a private citizen
3303157 this is another amazing step for me in celebrating being an american
3303158 seeing my fellow americans coming behind me and supporting me will be a great honor
3303159 people should understand that human rights and peoples lives are in jeopardy were not talking about contracts here were not talking abo ut money
3303160 one thing you cant do is confuse sports and politics i think the political guys are going to do what they need to do thats their job we are here to concentrate on a gold medal
3303161 i dont begrudge china the olympics i think theyll do well with them but there are so many of their governments policies that i find repulsive especially for athletes who have no intention but to help someone else
3303162 of course i would have liked to have been there advocating for a peaceful resolution but well figure something out
3303163 as the federation of caucasian associations we stress that south ossetia and abkhazia are not breakaway regions they are independent republics their invasion by georgia cannot be accepted just as no invasion in the world can decisions of independence by the people of these countries cannot be rendered null and void through wars south ossetia is currently under invasion by georgia babies are heartlessly being killed there and innocent mothers fathers and the elderly are being lynched
3303164 we want turkey and the rest of the world to recognize these two countries independence as they did for kosovo we call on international democracy and human rights organizations to call for an end to the barbarity in south ossetia

3303176 we were able to show in a very large sample that a snp within the znf804a gene on chromosome 2 was associated with an increased risk for schizophrenia
3303177 it could be used to increase yield in horticultural industries and manual pruning may be circumvented through the use of the natural strigolactones
3303178 because strigolactones are natural compounds which directly control shoot branching they can be applied without the use of gene transfer technologies and have minimal side effects on the plant
3303179 our discovery provides the first biosynthetic mutants to study these important interactions with plants and to develop ways of plant improvement and weed management
3303180 we are very excited about this discovery because hormones in plants and animals are an amazingly powerful and natural way to modify and investigate growth and development
3303181 the formal functioning of the nift patna started on time the classes began on schedule aug 4 after an orientation programme held last month
3303182 the amount will be spent on the nifts infrastructure including building and equipment of the total amount approved rs 270 million will be spent in the current financial year
3303183 weve learned that the nf1 gene affects stature through a different pathway than the one weve previously focussed on to understand cancers in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1
3303184 given that this second pathway has been linked to cancer in other contexts we may need to consider the possibility that it is contributing to these tumours and alter our treatment goals accordingly

3303239 the decision regarding making me jharkhand cm was taken long back but it is getting delayed hence we arrived at the decision to withdraw support for koda government if he does not resign now
3303240 upa high command has directed madhu koda to resign and facilitate my oath taking i will take oath as new cm as soon has he resigns there
3303241 upa high command is of the opinion that support should be withdrawn for koda government if he fails to resign congress has also asked koda to resign

3303247 claims that we can make superior snap decisions by trusting intuition or through the power of unconscious thought have received a great deal of attention in the media
3303248 trust your gut instinct when those shopping decisions get tough say scientists
3303249 at worst theyre outright dangerous in stark contrast to claims made by the dutch research team and in the media we found very little evidence of the superiority of unconscious thought for complex decisions
3303250 on the contrary our research suggests that unconscious thought is more susceptible to irrelevant factors such as how recently information has been seen rather than how important it is if conscious thinkers are given adequate time to encode material or are allowed to consult material while they deliberate their choices are at least as good as those made unconsciously
3303251 almost half the people who develop these tumours die from them and those who survive often suffer severe side effects from the treatment
3303252 improved treatments are urgently required but in order to develop these we need a deeper understanding of the molecular and cellular origins of medulloblastomas
3303253 there was good evidence that either cell type could be the origin of medulloblastomas but no one considered that both sets of evidence could be correct and that these tumours could actually begin in two different cell types
3303254 identifying the normal cell that gives rise to a tumour is important because it allows direct comparisons between tumour cells and their normal counterparts so that key differences and vulnerabilities in the tumour can be identified
3303255 also recent studies suggest that cells resembling the original cell may persist in mature tumours and can be critical in ensuring its survival if so these cells would be an excellent target for treatment
3303256 it has always been thought that cells had to mutate several times before becoming a tumour
3303257 in this study we found that some stem cells only needed to mutate once
3303258 they would not turn cancerous immediately but once they had been given an instruction to turn into a more specialised cell the mutation would take hold and they would instead turn into a tumour
3303259 this is an exciting and innovative initiative which highlights the environmental challenges facing all australians
3303260 this interactive computer game will give kids and adults alike a greater understanding of the daily pressures facing the environment through this experience it will help to build more environmentally responsible citizens
3303261 the game will help players understand how the choices that are made today will affect our environment tomorrow
3303262 i encourage students teachers parents and others to go to the website and see how successful they are at balancing the many environmental and social issues this game raises
3303263 over 60 animal species disappeared from the australian continent during that time mostly large to gigantic marsupials birds and reptiles
3303264 at the present time there is no substantive argument for a terminal extinction date of 46 4 kyr the current evidence indicating that there is no specific time period that correlates to any single mass extinction event
3303265 on the basis of available evidence arguments for either human or climatic causation are entirely circumstantial and implicitly require acceptance of many unproven assumptions
3303266 the elimination of the purported extinction window opens up the debate to the possibility that other large scale processes may have been important factors in the extinction process
3303267 this represents a significant shift in our approach to the study of this event and consideration of climate and environmental change must be factored into our studies
3303268 any claim for a human role on the extinction process must demonstrate at the minimum an association of humans and these now extinct animals only one site on the continent can do that cuddie springs in northern new south wales nowhere else has this association been found
3303269 it is not enough to argue for a lack of evidence for climate change to then put humans at the scene with no supporting evidence any arguments for a human role has to move beyond associations inferred by overlapping dates for occupation and megafauna persistence from distant and separate localities
3303270 overall we found outdoor workers perceptions of their workplaces support for sun protection and other health related behaviours strongly influenced their personal protective behaviour
3303271 to foster a supportive safety climate skin cancer control programmes should also be developed alongside other workplace health and safety interventions
3303272 focusing on the damage that sun exposure causes to the skin and the eyes might help increase outdoor workers understanding of their personal risk
3303273 supervisors and forepersons also need to promote and support their use and set an example by their own practices
3303274 eyebrows often reflect the culture and politics of an era

3303282 the number of primary care physicians who are diagnosing and treating bipolar patients has been on the rise in the past few years but surveyed primary care physicians follow a very different treatment pattern than surveyed psychiatrists
3303283 nearly half of the patients taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors first line receive these drugs as a monotherapy despite guideline recommendations to give bipolar patients presenting with depression an antimanic first line
3303284 if i put up with this wandering life its because i think maybe ill get the money that will mean i can make life easier for those around me

3303287 our results make it much more clear that all men and women concerned about their overall health should more closely monitor their blood levels of vitamin d and make sure they have enough
3303288 we think we have additional evidence to consider adding vitamin d deficiency as a distinct and separate risk factor for death from cardiovascular disease putting it alongside much better known and understood risk factors such as age gender family history smoking high blood cholesterol levels high blood pressure lack of exercise obesity and diabetes
3303289 now that we know vitamin d deficiency is a risk factor we can better assess how aggressively to treat people at risk of heart disease or those who are already ill and undergoing treatment
3303290 we need to be cautious with what were allowing someone to do and at what point in their recovery theyre allowed to do it

3303305 you dont want to think about it but its reality
3303306 when you hear about women who are widows at 23 with a baby you dont want that to be you being only 23 and sending your husband off to war is a terrifying thought but its his job and its what hes always wanted to do
3303307 what i try to tell my wife before i go is just live your life as if i was not around which is true
3303308 i dont want her to miss me everyday dont think about me all the time she needs to just kinda carry on with her life as its supposed to be
3303309 you know you want to get the same person back that you sent
3303310 i know that is tough for a lot of soldiers after being in a combat situation to return with the same kind of heart that they went with
3303311 zachs just such a good person that we just want that same person to come back whole in all ways physically and mentally
3303312 peoples lives depend on it and thats really scary to think that whether i say do this or do that someone could potentially get out just fine or be seriously injured
3303313 most people as soon as they come home at the end of the day their professional life stops and their personal life begins but for us its not that easy

3303328 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
3303329 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
3303330 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
3303331 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
3303332 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
3303333 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
3303334 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
3303335 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
3303336 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions

3303339 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
3303340 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3303341 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates

3303349 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure

3303352 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
3303353 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3303354 environmentalists will be forced to compromise next year and support the development of clean coal nuclear power and other alternative fuels
3303355 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3303356 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
3303357 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
3303358 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
3303359 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
3303360 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3303361 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done

3303363 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
3303364 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
3303365 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
3303366 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
3303367 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
3303368 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
3303369 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3303370 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
3303371 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
3303372 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
3303373 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
3303374 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
3303375 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
3303376 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
3303377 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
3303378 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
3303379 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
3303380 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
3303381 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
3303382 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
3303383 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
3303384 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
3303385 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
3303386 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
3303387 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
3303388 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
3303389 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
3303390 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
3303391 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
3303392 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term

3303395 before john mccains tour of duty in vietnam he married carol shepp a model from philadelphia on his 23rd bombing mission over north vietnam in 1967 mccain was shot down and captured
3303396 left her 4 inches shorter and on crutches and she had gained a good deal of weight
3303397 in 1979 at a military reception in honolulu mccain met cindy hensley an attractive 25 year old woman from a very wealthy politically connected arizona family cindys father jim founded the hensley and company the nations third largest anheuser busch distributor
3303398 she was lovely intelligent and charming 17 years my junior but poised and confident i monopolized her attention the entire time taking care to prevent anyone else from intruding on our conversation when it came time to leave the party i persuaded her to join me for drinks at the royal hawaiian hotel by the evenings end i was in love

3303404 anyone whos paid attention knows that obama makes many more gaffes than mccain
3303405 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
3303406 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3303407 treason fled before us for resistance was in vain while we were marching through georgia
3303408 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3303409 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3303410 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3303411 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3303412 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3303413 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3303414 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3303415 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3303416 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3303417 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3303418 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3303419 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
3303420 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
3303421 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
3303422 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
3303423 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
3303424 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
3303425 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
3303426 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3303427 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
3303428 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
3303429 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
3303430 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer

3303435 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3303436 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3303437 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3303438 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3303439 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3303440 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3303441 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3303442 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3303443 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3303444 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3303445 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
3303446 ive starting using the egg trick and ive been able to lower my commuting fuel costs by more than 10 per cent
3303447 historically presidential nominations were decided at the party conventions and as a result the vice presidential running mates were also selected at the conventions gallups jeff jones notes
3303448 that made it difficult to disentangle the effect of naming a vice presidential running mate on a candidates support from the
3303449 the small window of time after the announcement of a presidential candidates running mate but before the convention has taken place
3303450 similar to the pattern seen with clinton in 1996 support for gore held steady during bushs vice presidential selection phase at 41 percent
3303451 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3303452 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3303453 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3303454 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3303455 people can relate to other people that they know or people in a similar circumstance they are therefore more inclined to take a chance and do something different
3303456 green marketing is totally an increased buzzword the average person doesnt check to see if the word holds any weight with the business
3303457 people should look at what companies are actually doing to be sustainable
3303458 everyday i would take an industrial sized trash bag and at least fill it to the brim with paper and cardboard despite the fact that there were recycling bins available on campus
3303459 the only real trash that we had was coffee grinds and those are biodegradable
3303460 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3303461 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3303462 educate people that the climate crisis is both urgent and solvable
3303463 we ensure that every product or service they offer through the campaign makes it easier or cheaper for you to do your bit and help tackle climate change
3303464 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3303465 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3303466 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3303467 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3303468 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3303469 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3303470 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3303471 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3303472 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3303473 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3303474 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3303475 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3303476 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living

3303479 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3303480 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3303481 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3303482 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3303483 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3303484 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3303485 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3303486 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3303487 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3303488 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
3303489 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
3303490 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
3303491 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
3303492 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3303493 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3303494 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3303495 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3303496 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3303497 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3303498 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3303499 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3303500 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3303501 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3303502 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3303503 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3303504 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3303505 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3303506 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3303507 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3303508 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
3303509 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3303510 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3303511 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
3303512 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
3303513 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3303514 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3303515 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3303516 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3303517 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3303518 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3303519 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3303520 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3303521 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3303522 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3303523 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3303524 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3303525 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3303526 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3303527 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3303528 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3303529 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3303530 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3303531 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3303532 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3303533 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3303534 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3303535 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3303536 just so you all know we did set a record
3303537 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3303538 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3303539 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3303540 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3303541 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3303542 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3303543 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3303544 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3303545 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3303546 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3303547 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3303548 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3303549 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3303550 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
3303551 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
3303552 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
3303553 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
3303554 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
3303555 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
3303556 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
3303557 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
3303558 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
3303559 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
3303560 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
3303561 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
3303562 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
3303563 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
3303564 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
3303565 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
3303566 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
3303567 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
3303568 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
3303569 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
3303570 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
3303571 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
3303572 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3303573 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
3303574 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
3303575 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
3303576 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3303577 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3303578 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3303579 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3303580 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3303581 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
3303582 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
3303583 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
3303584 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
3303585 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
3303586 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
3303587 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
3303588 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3303589 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
3303590 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
3303591 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
3303592 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
3303593 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3303594 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3303595 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3303596 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3303597 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3303598 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3303599 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3303600 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3303601 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3303602 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3303603 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
3303604 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
3303605 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
3303606 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
3303607 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
3303608 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3303609 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
3303610 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
3303611 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3303612 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3303613 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3303614 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3303615 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3303616 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3303617 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3303618 empire of debt the rise of an epic financial crisis
3303619 the honest truth is that we have too many people in washington living for today rather than saving for tomorrow
3303620 give americans a good talking to about the countrys sloppy debt habits
3303621 the american people are a lot smarter than people give them credit for

3303731 everybody knows that barry bonds was on steroids but it has yet to be proven that roger clemens was
3303732 i still believe clemens is among the best and i dont think the steroids have that much of an impact
3303733 even if he did do it i dont think it affected his performance that much its not like hitting
3303734 barry bonds didnt necessarily lie like roger clemens did to congress
3303735 i know he might have been evasive but roger clemens in my opinion is flat out lying
3303736 i think we have a bias because baseball is traditionally the national pastime
3303737 were harder on things that we have a greater respect for or at least did have a greater respect for
3303738 maybe baseball is getting so much coverage simply because there are baseball players in front of congress
3303739 but i dont think its congresss business to get involved its not a government issue its up to the owners and the union to police their own
3303740 its time to move the game forward there is little to be gained at this point in debating dated misconduct

3303776 the current economic scenario and volatile stock market situation have changed the outlook for investment options in this sector the market was now suited for long term investors more so for end users rather than investors looking at short term capital gains
3303777 economic growth is likely to be 7 7 per cent this fiscal it is unlikely to be more than this though it may fall below
3303778 interest rates have moved up and there has been a slowdown in exports to us rest of asia and cost of fuel has increased slowing down the manufacturing sector
3303779 this phenomenon is puzzling retail credit has slowed down there is a huge anomaly
3303780 any director is automatically disqualified if convicted of one or a number of offences by a competent court anywhere in the world
3303781 if the basis of the round doha negotiations has to see a change in its very objectives it would be tough going for global trade integration
3303782 the us will be able to spend much more on subsidies
3303783 one of the reasons for decline in production is the trade distorting subsidies and high tariffs in the rich countries
3303784 if the eu says we are going to reduce tariffs for airplanes what does it mean for india and africa
3303785 i want to import cotton from africa but if there is 40 per cent subsidy in the us my industry is not going to buy it from africa
3303786 i would have thought cotton would have become a goodwill case cotton must be tackled seriously
3303787 i learnt that developed countries had already been using it for the last 14 years
3303788 its getting hard to keep track of all the horrific things obama represents we already know that hes simultaneously a fundamentalist muslim and a black supremacist christian and weve recently learned that hes a communist but now we know that hes a gay crack addict too
3303789 if consumers feel that a particular salt is the best food brand in the country you accept that verdict this is a consumer democracy
3303790 itc is doing what any new player in the market does imitating and emulating the leader and cash from the cigarette business certainly helps
3303791 market share is the result of what we have done but it is not the objective its a measure of the impact of our activities which are directed to secure profitable growth moreover the way we measure market share today is rather conventional especially when markets are morphing
3303792 the shareholder issue has no impact on how we run or execute strategy and about the intellectual property rights ipr controversy the less said the better it is a minor issue in the life of a company we are fighting at least 25 infringements on our tiger brand across india this is a case not unique to us but one which every consumer product firm faces from our point of view it is our responsibility to protect our ipr be it in a village in uttar pradesh or globally
3303793 its a healthy alternative consistent with our credo of swasth khao eat healthy we have taken important nutritional steps and are the only biscuit maker in the country without trans fat hopefully indian food regulators will bring in a law to this effect soon
3303794 increasing the price of a glucose biscuit packet from rs 3 to rs 4 is one heck of a big job a whopping 33 per cent increase but we did it without our competitors following suit with the kind of inflation we are seeing in commodity prices the entire profit pool of the industry was in danger for any business to run on a sustainable basis and continue to offer the right quality hard decisions need to be taken when necessitated
3303795 it is challenging and difficult but one or two challenging years are not a big deal this too will come to an end we are not running the business on a month to month or quarter to quarter basis yes it is hard to actually generate consistently high margins but this is what leadership is all about to manage and deliver when things arent going too smoothly
3303796 the home shopping sector in india has been widely tele shopping that to of a particular category either spiritual or health and wellness we realised with the home shopping industry being unorganised there is potential to offer a complete virtual retail experience through a channel
3303797 currently our viewership is around 3 million households across 350 cities and we have delivered products to around 1 600 cities with the viewership we have as of now and with the cable and satellite homes in india being 70 million there is tremendous scope for growth television has higher penetration than any other form of retail in india
3303798 there is scope to sell products through home shopping channels such channels generate consumer interest
3303799 the real estate play will require the network to sign up with developers this will happen at a later stage initially the focus will be on companies and brands that need marketing support
3303800 brand will decide to be apart of home shopping channels depending on the product life cycle
3303801 in our case online sales contribute 3 4 per cent we expect this to pick up likewise we realise that it is important to be present across new distribution networks such as home shopping however we will consider it when the time comes
3303802 there are simultaneous manifestations of severe injustice in india today such as appalling levels of continued child undernourishment lack of entitlement to basic education and medical attention of the poorer members of the society whatever else nyaya may demand and we can have all sorts of different views of what a perfectly just india would look like the reasoned humanity of the justice of nyaya can hardly fail to demand the urgent removal of these terrible deprivations in human lives
3303803 to think more clearly about what should be done we have to ask what should keep us awake at night
3303804 in probing the idea of social justice it is important to distinguish between an arrangement focused view of justice and a realisation focused understanding of justice sometimes justice is conceptualised in terms of certain organisational arrangements some institutions some regulations some behavioural rules the active presence of which indicates that justice is being done
3303805 a realization focused understanding of justice broadens the evaluation of justice to the assessment of the actual world that emerges which includes most importantly the lives that the people involved are able to lead
3303806 this is another exciting development for tesco it complements our entries into china and the united states giving us access to another of the most important economies in the world our wholesale cash and carry format will bring improved value range and service to thousands of indian businesses
3303807 their tescos wholesale cash and carry business will provide us with the opportunity to tap into a world class supply chain thereby delivering the best of products and services to our customers

3303809 what bolivians have expressed with their vote is the consolidation of this process of change
3303810 with this ratification what has been confirmed is the countrys polarisation
3303811 which team beat the hell out of the nats more than any others

3303813 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3303814 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3303815 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3303816 he was responsible for what i think was the golden age of bbc television which well never have again
3303817 he knew how to treat performers he knew how to talk to them how to get them to do things even if they didnt want to he talked them into it because he knew it would be good for them
3303818 without him i dont think the show would have gone on he undoubtedly had a nose for a hit
3303819 he was a wonderful showman and a great believer in his producers and he backed us absolutely to the hilt
3303820 he was an entrepreneur and theres not many of his type about any more im afraid we shall miss him terribly i loved him
3303821 basically fundamentally television was a performers medium and news and current affairs were the sideshow
3303822 he was both a great impresario and also a passionate believer in public service broadcasting
3303823 under his leadership in the 70s the bbc commissioned and produced a raft of entertainment and comedy which set a benchmark for these genres which has rarely been surpassed
3303824 from monty python to morecambe and wise from the generation game to dads army these shows and others like them have helped to define not just a genre but a generation
3303825 it is our firm resolve that we will root out terrorism from pakistan and all of our security agencies are working together to achieve this goal
3303826 is a famous place for the younger crowd to ride their vehicles
3303827 he was a real gentleman he had a great work ethic for us
3303828 he was a real fun and energetic guy we wish his family the best under these unfortunate circumstances
3303829 were working hard on the case i have multiple detectives assigned
3303830 he was moving trying to back out of the driveway trying to get away
3303831 people who like good wine like good food garlic fits right in
3303832 i have a wonderful collection of gourmet garlic from around the world
3303833 i dare someone to have a bigger collection ill shake their hand
3303834 the lcp essentially prohibits private ownership in the coastal planned commercial zone
3303835 there is nothing that we found in the regulations that would modify ownership in this area it has to be publicly owned
3303836 i thought itd just be easier to just blow it off and do nothing
3303837 he told me about how regimented it was but they treated the kids with respect

3303887 i always think just because you are allowed to do something does not mean you should necessarily do it if you impose a few restrictions on yourself it forces you to come up with cleverer ways to get round things
3303888 bbc3 wants to be a young persons channel and they think the way to do that is to be as risky as they can i just never ever watch bbc3 i dont think it is tuned in on my tv it is tv that further polarises and atomises audiences there is that kind of tv where your dad has to leave the room every ten minutes because he is too embarrassed to watch i want to avoid that
3303889 there is a way to talk about taboo subjects and adult subjects without making people feel like they need a bath seinfeld does it the simpsons does it always in such a clever way and that is what you should be aiming for

3303971 not only the farmers of course beekeepers contract harvesters the organic growers and indeed local councils are all going to be i think able to make good use of this information

3303975 im very disappointed with gene ethics that theyd stoop to putting those sites on the public arena purely on the basis that they will hope that enough pressure will bear that those farmers will stop using that biotechnology
3303976 theyre putting undue pressure on those farmers even if theyre growing or not growing in naming them in a public arena
3303977 i assure you well take action against gene ethics or anyone else who starts discriminating against farmers who access new technologies
3303978 not only the farmers of course bee keepers contract harvesters the organic growers and indeed local councils are all going to be i think able to make good use of this information

3303980 a lot of sites have been known previously and to our knowledge nothing has ever happened
3303981 its just fair that in a democratic society that this information should be in the public domain and to raise the bogey of threats is really just off the point

3304052 if we play like we played this week then we will beat australia it is going to take a lot to do it this is a one off and a starting stage but the key is to turn up to every single test match like we did this week
3304053 what we have got to do is look at the australians and learn from them they are on it every day and every session that is what we have to do and my main drive with this team is to be on top of it every day and make sure we do not have any comfort zones
3304054 i have been doing a lot of thinking over the last few days about scenarios i definitely have done a lot more thinking about australia than i would have done as a player because you want to get your structure right so players play in certain position for a long amount of time they can then feel comfortable know their role and deliver
3304055 for instance weve learned that when someone has a haploid insufficiency and is missing one copy of the tgf a gene he or she is more vulnerable to environmental insults that can cause cleft palate such as drugs smoking and alcohol
3304056 we found that if we blocked tgf a or the receptors a cleft palate develops but when smad4 was blocked normal palate epithelium still covered the palatal shelf
3304057 this information is useful not just for palate and teeth but also for cancer and cell biology in general ultimately we have to be translational in order to make ourselves useful to patients
3304058 sadly trophy jaws and teeth from sharks are relatively commonplace whereas living sharks are becoming increasingly rare
3304059 sharks have continual turnover of dentition throughout their lifespan and consequently teeth may be collected from the seafloor in areas where sharks aggregate without the need to use invasive sampling methods such as biopsy
3304060 these data support our hunch that low genetic variation in grey nurse shark is probably due to longer term processes than the recent human induced population crash
3304061 we also have plans to use approaches like this to identify rogue individuals
3304062 theyre basically big springs at the base of the rocket
3304063 these neurons seem to have been registering after the rat made its decision how uncertain the animal was that it was about to receive its desired reward we tested several alternative explanations but the best explanation for the neural activity we observed was that these neurons were signalling the confidence of the animal about its decisions
3304064 although previous work had suggested that confidence estimates might be a complex process restricted to humans and perhaps other primates our results to the contrary show that for the brain to estimate confidence in a choice is no more complex than calculating the choice itself
3304065 this new option to abort and restart constitutes a decision that should be made based on the level of confidence about getting a reward
3304066 ultimately confidence about getting a reward is a direct function of the animals confidence about the decision they have just made in this way we sought to measure a variable internal to the animals how confident they were about whether they made the right choice or not by observing how it influenced their behaviour

3304089 it is irrational to sell government land to meet budget deficit it is also disastrous to sell it before reserving a bit for public utility
3304090 we have earmarked the land for public utility and nobody should be concerned about that and there is no chance for irregularities as the auction process is transparent
3304091 we have to garner public opinion against this otherwise these land sharks will buy the whole bangalore

3304133 any side that makes the top eight can beat anyone in the top eight the only difference is that probably melbourne and manly have been very consistent as far as their season is concerned that doesnt mean anything when it comes to a one off game in a playoff
3304134 the only bonus for the top four obviously is the first home semi and playing melbourne in a phone box thats a definite advantage for them
3304135 if they run eighth i wouldnt really want to play them if i ran first
3304136 theyre right up there the sides weve played recently have all been big physical sides in melbourne canberra and the knights very similar
3304137 four big games and four sides coming into the finals who probably think that they can beat us

3304157 dia tidak ingin ada semacam kultus individu itu yang dia hindari dia tak ingin dipuji tapi ingin ditulis andaryoko bilang yang penting bukan dirinya
3304158 mengapa peristiwa itu muncul di blitar bukan di batavia jakarta atau daerah lain ini yang jadi pertanyaan
3304159 jangan jangan dia supriyadi memang masih ada karena masih disebut oleh bung karno
3304160 saya kira semua masih bisa dilacak sejarahnya ini akan memperkaya khasanah sejarah indonesia terutama pasca 45 kita perlu mendengarkan yang lain
3304161 nama wisnuprabu saya pakai setelah saya melakukan tirakat orang orang peta memang dari dulu suka melakukan lelaku lelaku
3304162 usai mengetik melik meremas remas naskah teks proklamasi yang ditulis bung karno itu dia pikir kertas itu tidak diperlukan lagi karena sudah ada naskah ketikan naskah itu dibuang ke tempat sampah
3304163 beruntung naskah asli itu tidak dirobek hanya diremas sampai kumal setelah itu naskah itu diseterika dan menjadi bagus lagi bung karno mengantonginya dan sekarang disimpan di arsip nasional

3304176 the purpose of the operation has been achieved the security of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been restored
3304177 if we have received the order to cease fire this does not mean that we have stopped all actions including reconnaissance

3304204 julianne was in a hat and big sunglasses she kept quietly asking why she couldnt get on but was very polite about it
3304205 but everyone started staring once she said she had reserved a seat and told the ticket taker her name
3304206 so he began spelling out her name and yelling to the driver m for mary o for octopus r for robert moore moore she handled it so cool
3304207 plans are very hush hush but madonna is definitely going to celebrate in style
3304208 unfortunately not everything has gone as expected as shes had many other things on her mind not least rehearsals for her sticky and sweet tour on top of all the stress she twisted her ankle over the weekend
3304209 she views this as a sign she should postpone the birthday bash and play it by ear instead madonna now thinks it will go ahead during a three day break in the tour towards the end of the month
3304210 guy wants the party to be traditional and british he has already ordered crate loads of real ale hes also arranged for a folk band to play and the people invited gwyneth paltrow stella mccartney and trudie styler are basically friends madonnas known for years

3304212 julia was trying to get out of the way of the picture she wasnt being sarcastic
3304213 ive always felt like we have the best fans in the nfl and that they would support our team regardless of how they feel about myself or brett or management or whatever
3304214 but it was a great reception when we took the field
3304215 offensively we got off to a slow start but we picked up the pace as the half went on
3304216 we got up early then had to battle back late
3304217 if he goes he has to go but you want to try to stay out of the double play its kind of a catch 22
3304218 he obviously did a good job of staying in the rundown hustling and getting back to third base

3304222 als wir gestartet sind konnte ja keiner ahnen wie sich der lpreis noch entwickeln w rde
3304223 wir hatten eigentlich vor die w rme zun chst zum gleichen preis wie bei den herk mmlichen heizmethoden anzubieten und dann sp ter langsam runterzugehen
3304224 ich will nicht irgendwelchen l monopolisten in moskau oder dubai ihre pal ste finanzieren
3304225 hier in rai breitenbach wei ich wenigstens dass das geld an der richtigen stelle ankommt

3304228 ihnen m chte ich sagen fahren sie nach hause und erz hlen sie allen dass es geht wenn man nur hartn ckig bleibt
3304229 daf r haben wir zus tzlich zu den heizungsrohren noch leere rohre verlegt die man einfach nutzen kann

3304263 hes not going to speak to anyone on this issue
3304264 when we had this massive 20 million budget cut it probably did not sit well with him he went through a tough tough time
3304265 hes looking forward to continuing the work he has done as sheriff
3304266 hes glad that the financial crisis is generally behind the department
3304267 i want to make it clear that ive enjoyed my tenure as sheriff
3304268 but without exception i find it necessary to decline on these many fine offers and opportunities
3304269 other than the rumors i had no serious indication that he was looking elsewhere
3304270 there is absolutely no doubt in my mind about the sheriffs commitment to the people in passaic county
3304271 hes not going to speak to anyone on this issue

3304279 mr rudd must tell west australians whether the 134 000 job losses will occur in this state and if so where and in which parts of the economy and in which businesses
3304280 he has to answer why there was a 2 billion tax hike on gas condensate a 2 billion tax hike on the north west shelf which we believe will be passed onto domestic gas users in this state
3304281 and he must also answer why he has done nothing to reduce grocery or oil prices as he promised to do at the last election
3304282 mr rudd does have history of a relationship with brian burke that he tried to avoid in the lead up to the federal election
3304283 all those issues of his dealings with brian burke and how honest he was with the australian people about his relations with brian burke will be the focus of his visit here
3304284 weve already had five ministers resign since the last election how many more would be resigning if wed heard from the ccc on this governments shady dealings
3304285 we on our side are more than committed to embracing a deeper and broader defence and security relationship with singapore
3304286 its in good shape now i will not criticise anything thats happened in the past
3304287 i think we can however make it deeper and broader into the future thats in our interests and i think its in singapores interests as well
3304288 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3304289 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3304290 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3304291 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3304292 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3304293 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3304294 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3304295 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3304296 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect
3304297 were going to continue our peaceful struggle for the return of the president
3304298 when i heard about it i felt really hurt inside
3304299 i cannot believe a writer could write something like that its the not the way that we want to be portrayed we have feelings we dont like the word retard we are people were just like any other people out there we want to be ourselves and not be discriminated against
3304300 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive
3304301 no changes or cuts to the film will be made

3304306 people who lived here initially have been lucky they were able to find a place to stay and some even moved back to their homes i am not so lucky i only have my daughter here in south africa and if they close the camp we will have no place to go i lost everything during the violence
3304307 we are seeking an order preventing the closing down of the camp until there is a comprehensive re integration plan
3304308 i cant go back now they burnt down my shack and people have already built on my spot i need more time to look for a new location to build a home

3304314 were going to continue our peaceful struggle for the return of the president
3304315 its less than six degrees of separation from one unsolved mystery to another or from the
3304316 in a bizarre case of six degrees of scandal separation hunter was married in the 1990s to kip hunter son of the colorado district attorney who famously led the failed jonbenet ramsey murder investigation they divorced in 1999
3304317 faced with challenging economic conditions affecting consumer spending behavior and escalating input costs were particularly encouraged by these results
3304318 the good news is that there still may be a possibility to move this forward and conclude these negotiations within the time frame which all the wto members had agreed since last year that is end 2008
3304319 had you completed the members of the committee reset the oral argument on the meralco case on june 23 and resolved the impasse it would have been much easier
3304320 we in the court of appeals act as divisions why did you not call the other justices involved associate justices myrna dimaranan vidal and vicente roxas to get their opinion
3304321 panicking i have never seen a member of the court of appeals panicking
3304322 once the decision has been signed by the justices i regarded it as a duty to promulgate it
3304323 why did you not wait for the decision of the presiding justice you are not children
3304324 after such deliberation if the other members agreed with the report the ponente shall write the decision for signature and immediate promulgation
3304325 if it will tell me to jump into the river i will
3304326 promulgation of decisions and resolutions shall be the direct responsibility of the division of the clerk of court
3304327 there is no provision which allows a justice to promulgate no sir
3304328 now what is our basis in saying that there is a provision i know that the irca is our bible
3304329 the irca is patterned under the rules of court i dont know i must have been teaching the wrong civil procedure
3304330 unless the milf renegades will comply to leave peacefully we shall continue with our clearing operations amid our intensified operations we will not compromise the lives of the civilians residing in the affected areas
3304331 they are free to request more military assets and resources more units if they wish to but so far there is no such request
3304332 there is resistance from the milf but this is not insurmountable
3304333 it is very clear our operations are focused in north cotabato it is not a widespread and simultaneous operations against all other base commands of the milf that has been made clear
3304334 we have to again urge the milf forces to rein in their forces control so that peace will reign in those areas not only in north cotabato but the rest of mindanao
3304335 ironically the relief that is supposed to accompany falling oil prices is not materializing
3304336 instead falling oil prices are now seen as affirming what policy makers are warning about the global economic slowdown extending from 2008 into 2009
3304337 given that asian currencies are growth currencies this u shaped recovery outlook is not welcome
3304338 dollar asia was strong yesterday and today i think a lot of players were stopped out
3304339 the combination of broad us dollar strength downward growth revisions to asia and a rebalancing of fx policy bias away from inflation prevention to growth promotion has prompted us to revise our asia fx forecasts
3304340 due to their domestic demand driven economies and improving real yields on falling inflation attracting portfolio inflows

3304344 groei en naamsbekendheid is natuurlijk een grote kans maar het gebrek aan controle is een bedreiging nu kan de mooiste winkel die je met zorg uitkiest je merk op bijvoorbeeld marktplaats doen belanden en het op een prijsagressieve manier wegzetten hetzelfde geldt voor de distributie het is natuurlijk ook een bedreiging voor de fysieke winkels vandaar dat ze er vrijwel allemaal een webshop naast beginnen er zijn zelfs professionele detaillisten die ons merk verkopen via veilingsites dat is wel een doorn in het oog het is jammer dat het moeilijk is om met de detaillist hier goede afspraken over te maken niettemin zijn wij erg tevreden met enkele zeer professionele webshops
3304345 je merk op internet is heel moeilijk te beschermen daarom is het belangrijk een samenwerkingsstrategie te volgen ga een gesprek aan met webshops en lever ze in ieder geval de goede spullen zoals fotos
3304346 hoewel kinderkleding een prima uitgangspunt heeft om op internet te verkopen vanwege de eenduidigere maten zijn veel bedrijven niet ingericht op n stuks leveringen het is heel begrijpelijk om op dit moment als merk te zeggen dat je het niet doet als je je klanten en logistieke service niet op orde hebt vraag is of de baten wel opwegen tegen de kosten je fysieke winkel en je webwinkel moeten synergie opleveren anders gezegd als je het doet doe het dan ge ntegreerd beloon bijvoorbeeld personeel dat klanten doorverwijst naar de webshop voor bestaande merken is ook best lastig om de switch naar multichannel te maken het is daarom aan te raden eerst te experimenteren
3304347 in nederland hebben we nog geen e shop maar op het deense hoofdkantoor zijn ze aan het experimenteren met allerlei internetplatforms onze winkeliers die een webshop erbij beginnen kunnen en willen we niet tegenhouden het feit dat je op internet ook eindeseizoensspullen tegenkomt is wel lastig maar niet te controleren we gaan ervan uit dat de klant die minder bonafide websites wel herkent
3304348 wij kiezen voor selectieve distributie en willen niet sec webwinkels bedienen als we zelf een webshop zouden beginnen is het natuurlijk concurrentie voor de zelfstandige detaillist ik geloof wel in internet dus we stimuleren ondernemers wel om het web op te gaan dan ligt het voordeel ook bij de detaillist vraag is altijd wat je met je merk doet geef je het vrij voor nederland of niet natuurlijk is het niet prettig als er tweedehandskleertjes op bijvoorbeeld marktplaats staan maar je kunt nooit alles afschermen
3304349 alleen zichtbaar zijn op het internet kan vragen oproepen omtrent je betrouwbaarheid het is dan ook terecht dat sommige merken ook anno 2008 nog huiverig zijn voor verkoop en zichtbaarheid in shops op internet voor merken met eigen winkels dreigt natuurlijk het gevaar van een kanaalconflict en de distributie die in het geweer komt het is begrijpelijk dat winkels zich daar tegen verzetten
3304350 op dit moment zoeken we naar verdieping van ons merk waarschijnlijk komt die eigen webshop er wel een keer maar dan wel op onze manier en niet via andere internetsites

3304363 dont throw in the towel please reserve whats on the table we have never been so close
3304364 two days after a failure such unanimous view was and remains surprising
3304365 the u s remains committed to a successful doha round however we continue to have deep concerns with proposals under consideration that would not only limit market opening by the worlds fastest growing economies but would actually raise new barriers to trade particularly against other developing countries
3304366 the west is supporting one palestinian faction over the other its all about politics not human rights
3304367 we have warned of the west bank government turning into a security regime and there are indications that we are heading in that direction
3304368 as we all know hamas is not only working in gaza

3304380 dont show your anger in the north and some other states on peter alphonse congress mla and senior leader who was present on the dias
3304381 you should look at the common ideology that bound the two parties together we had vowed not to allow communalist forces in the state after seeing the gory side of the bjp in the wake of the babri masjid demolition
3304382 we should not disappoint people from backward and most backward classes
3304383 i lost in tie breaker but the score was not too bad its not that i lost because i shot low things just didnt go well in tie breaker where i shot eight had it been nine that would have put her on pressure for she had to score a 10 to win it
3304384 inflation is likely to touch the 13 14 per cent mark by october but it may soften after that
3304385 we are in constant touch with the rbi on the rebranding issue
3304386 but it leaves a big vacuum and we are deeply concerned about this vacuum because it leaves the radical extremist outfits with freedom to do what they like not merely on the pak afghan border but clearly our side of the border too
3304387 like nature abhors a vacuum we abhor the political vacuum that exists in pakistan it greatly worries us

3304393 it is wrong to compare the success of the two films the hindi film industry is one big market whatever money earned from the movies made goes into one kitty the film industry every one benefits out of successful films actors fees also goes up
3304394 in an area like juhu in suburban mumbai there are 28 shows of the film in one multiplex alone due to this 80 to 90 per cent money is recovered by the producer
3304395 it is quite natural that the collections slump at the start of the second week everything depends on how steep is the decline in box office collections if the steep is less the film is sure to bounce back during the weekend
3304396 i have been around for only 15 16 years to become a king one has to have a long span of good work i may call myself if i survive for another 15 years

3304404 the advance casts doubts on russias claim that this five day war is just a peacekeeping operation
3304405 this war is all about russia and the message russias sending to the world this is putins announcement that russia is back as a great power
3304406 we have to understand these russian troops didnt materialize out of nowhere
3304407 this is the culmination of putins efforts to pull georgia back within russias sphere and exert control over it
3304408 i am getting a little bit sick and tired of what were seeing a battle of words from left and right
3304409 i think theres a perception these compounds hold untapped potential to help us understand the human mind
3304410 the working hypothesis is that if psilocybin or lsd can occasion these experiences of great personal meaning and spiritual significance then it would allow patients with terminal illnesses hopefully to face their own demise completely differently to restructure some of the psychological angst that so often occurs concurrently with severe disease

3304412 investigators need to be confident that the volunteer could not exit the window if in a delusional state
3304413 the way i view it is we experienced some kind of broad cultural trauma back in the 60s and these drugs became demonised in that context
3304414 as a culture we just decided clinical research shouldnt be done with this class of compounds
3304415 this was partly the federal regulatory authorities it was partly the funding agencies and it was partly the academics themselves leary had so discredited a scientific approach to studying these compounds that anyone who expressed an interest in doing so was automatically discredited
3304416 i came here with very open expectations you can lose to anybody at the olympics
3304417 a typical cable has an inner core of copper it varies how many pairs then some kind of wrapping around the inner core then the outer jacket itself
3304418 we have the process working so effectively that in some cases we dont need to winch the cable at all as the pressure from the pump forces the cable out as it is so well greased
3304419 it is unlikely that it will be more than 250 metres between man holes for a ducted cable
3304420 manhole covers are unlikely to be more than 250 metres apart indeed there are usually less than 200 metres apart
3304421 but the fact is in some cases the cable can be trapped in ducts because of silt subsidence or the environment means that it may not be possible to extract the cable but it is possible for us to pump our fluid into the ring space our process allows for the extracting of the core and then allow for the recycling of the copper

3304436 this will act as a cap on the groups rating with earnings potentially disappointing as asset growth slows next year

3304444 left and right all americans know that freedom is better that slavery that love is better than hate kindness better than cruelty tolerance better than bigotry we dont always know how we know these things and yet mysteriously we know them nonetheless
3304445 the true complexity arises when we must defend these values in a world that does not universally embrace them when we reach the place where we must be intolerant in order to defend tolerance or unkind in order to defend kindness or hateful in order to defend what we love
3304446 whomever is kind to the cruel will end up being cruel to the kind
3304447 members of the antiwar movement wound up being involved in the betrayal of far eastern nations in a genocide and in the suffering today imposed on 30 million people there do those convinced pacifists hear the moans coming from there do they understand their responsibility today or do they prefer not to hear

3304463 when i was 11 years old i received a gift of happiness from god
3304464 i was riding my bicycle when a strong gust of wind blew me onto the ground into the path of an oncoming truck the truck ran over me and cut off my leg
3304465 as i lay there bleeding i realized that i might have to live the rest of my life without a leg how depressing but then i realized that being depressed wont get my leg back so i decided right then and there not to waste my life despairing
3304466 when my parents arrived at the hospital they were shocked and grieving so i told them ive already adapted now you also have to get used to this
3304467 ever since then i see my friends getting upset over little things their bus came late they got a bad grade on a test somebody insulted them but i just enjoy life
3304468 my whole life would improve if i had a new car
3304469 i just need a better job and then i can relax and be happy
3304470 who is rich the one who appreciates what he has
3304471 try to stop me and ill take you with me
3304472 umm no problem sir have a safe trip any last words
3304473 let me tell you my troubles my wife left me my kids wont talk to me i lost my job and my pet turtle died so why should i go on living
3304474 sir close your eyes for a minute and imagine that you are blind no colors no sights of children playing no fields of flowers no sunset now imagine that suddenly theres a miracle you open your eyes and your vision is restored are you going to jump or will you stick around for a week to enjoy the sights
3304475 ah i guess theyre not so bad i can see
3304476 once i know the tools for being happy then it will work like magic
3304477 if i become content and satisfied with what i have ill lose my motivation to achieve more
3304478 i have a boat do you want to go fishing
3304479 happiness is optional if i want to be depressed thats my own prerogative
3304480 who forgot the forks its too hot for volleyball i want to go home already

3304584 leeds city council has taken the unprecedented step of applying for this injunction because of the consistent nuisance mr carey poses to the city
3304585 this order which we believe to be the first of its kind in the country means that he can no longer clog up our roads with vehicles he is trying to sell
3304586 it is an activity that attracts many complaints from the general public and is detrimental to the overall look of the city causing an eyesore obstructing the maintenance of verges and roads and is a distraction to motorists
3304587 mr carey has continually ignored our efforts to resolve the issue
3304588 these cars are often bought at auction polished up and sold on quickly as a commercial trade unlike proper traders buyers cant always find the sellers again should problems arise with the car
3304589 the law is quite clear clubs pay for any policing inside the ground and on immediately adjacent property under their control on matchday
3304590 any other provision deemed necessary is covered by the state its what people pay their taxes for with the premier league alone contributing more that 700 million a year to the treasury let alone the tax take from the 13 million fans who attend premier league games during the course of a season
3304591 this long established principle applies to all individuals and organisations in the uk from private individuals to shopping centres pubs and major events like the notting hill carnival
3304592 our clubs work well with their local police forces to make sure that the call on their resources is as little as possible
3304593 they have invested heavily in all seater stadia cctv and stewarding as a result the numbers of police required to ensure public safety and therefore the cost has reduced over the past 15 years
3304594 we are always happy to discuss how it might be possible to further reduce costs or indeed how football can help the police tackle youth crime but we fail to see why football fans should pay twice for policing
3304595 the cash we get to police our various areas across the country is provided by government is provided by people through council tax and the provision of that is to provide a policing service to those areas and to those communities
3304596 if we have to take officers away from them to police football we are not able to recover the cost of that that means our normal police budget is being used for that purpose which means we then have to provide a lesser service to the rest of the community
3304597 the group of young people from centrepoint have shown tremendous commitment and hard work and i congratulate them on winning the award for heritage
3304598 it is a delight to see the progress that they have made at scotney castle with the hard work that the groups have given us areas of the walled garden have started to develop and take shape they should all give themselves a huge pat on the back
3304599 i really enjoyed the course i loved it when we mowed the lawns and built the new paths its good to grasp the skills now and be able to use them later when i have a job and move on from centrepoint
3304600 i am thrilled to hear about the award and that the hard work of these young people has been recognised
3304601 they have shown dedication and team work and have made huge contributions to the heritage work at scotney castle the partnership between centrepoint and the national trust and capel manor has been extremely successful
3304602 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
3304603 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient

3304638 in looking at the charge i think the charge was fair considering the tackle
3304639 he had some loading and that sort of thing as well so when you really look at it three games hes probably pretty lucky
3304640 its disappointing for everyone because at this stage of the season youd like to have everyone available particularly the smarter players your better players and your senior players
3304641 its obvious that they want to use this as evidence for the guernsey court to continue extending a freeze on a bnp paribas account belonging to my client

3304644 i was actively involved in the game but once we went 1 3 down it became increasingly difficult for me and i was hardly involved afterwards
3304645 i need to work on my conditioning for games because having been out for so long it will take time before i come back into shape it is the aspect i need to improve in and then i am confident the goals will come

3304648 demonstrates the importance both countries place on bilateral military interactions and the political support from both countries for the various training arrangements between their armed forces
3304649 with respect to parramatta i think the roosters were a little unlucky in many ways i was at the game live and i think they got some tough calls
3304650 if anthony tupou puts the ball down with a minute to go they probably win the game
3304651 parramatta played alright but im comfortable the way were travelling the last few games also
3304652 were not afraid to play this side next monday night and im certainly not going to add to any fear by telling them weve lost six in a row thats a very negative attitude
3304653 plenty of sides have shown they can beat parramatta and were no different
3304654 okay we havent had a lot of wins against them but theres plenty of teams we havent had a lot of wins against like penrith melbourne
3304655 what happened second half last week let alone last year five years ago means nothing if you worry about putting your left shoe on before you put your right shoe on because youre superstitious and you start letting those things get into your head we dont worry about those things
3304656 i would like to take this opportunity to thank iprimus for their outstanding support and partnership over the last five years and i am pleased that iprimus would like to continue with us in some form
3304657 anyone who partners with our club now will be joining a club that is heading into an exciting new era
3304658 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3304659 the purpose of the operation has been achieved the security of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been restored
3304660 if we have received the order to cease fire this does not mean that we have stopped all actions including reconnaissance
3304661 we respect the fact they are a really good side but were looking forward to taking them on
3304662 we think and we know we can beat them for us its a big challenge
3304663 were not going to be intimidated by them but were going to go out there and give it a crack and look forward to it
3304664 im really looking forward to the game and i know the guys are you see a really big challenge against a team like this and one that could really shape our season
3304665 weve been pretty lucky with the way the results have fallen and now the ball is firmly in our court with three games to go
3304666 if we can win two or three of them we can really get ourselves up for another crack at it
3304667 its up to us now theres no excuses and theres no point on relying on other games weve had our luck in that respect its up to us
3304668 geelong are doing everything right and certainly look on course to put their name out there in respect to teams like that
3304669 were happy to take them on wherever i think anz stadium is going to be really good its going to be a finals type atmosphere on the ground and if we can get a big crowd out there it should help
3304670 its a good question hopefully roosy swans coach paul roos has got a few things to tell us this week a few secrets
3304671 they are just one of those sides that they havent got any real major weaknesses you can pick out they are really good all over the field
3304672 they dont rely on any one forward and as a defence coming in against a team like that it makes it pretty difficult to plan
3304673 theyve got threats everywhere and probably one of the biggest advantage of our defence is we can be pretty versatile and we are going to have to be this week
3304674 i think you will probably see a few different matchups throughout the course of the game
3304675 they have made it possible for us to observe large areas of the ocean under the sea ice in winter for the first time
3304676 the sea ice causes problems for us in terms of observing the ocean in that it makes ship observation very expensive and slow
3304677 satellites cant see the ocean through the ice and the profiling floats we are using throughout the worlds oceans now are also unable to surface through the ice and transmit their data by satellite
3304678 the sea ice is important for climate because it is bright and reflects the suns energy back into space so if we have less sea ice the earth tends to absorb more energy and so warm up
3304679 weve never been able to measure how much sea ice is actually forming before and the seal data is allowing us to do that for the first time
3304680 we will be instrumenting a total of about 160 seals both in the arctic and antarctic using several different species of seal because different seals go to different places to feed so we can get information from different parts of the ocean
3304681 up until now people thought that the tasmanian mega fauna had actually gone extinct before people arrived on the island
3304682 things were very climatically stable in that part of australia and yet the mega fauna still managed to go extinct
3304683 so its down to humans of one sort or another
3304684 a lot of people still have in their minds an axe wielding spear wielding people bloodthirsty out there slaughtering all over the place it wasnt like that at all
3304685 it was basically just one joey baby kangaroo in the pot for christmas and thats all youve got to go to do to drive slow breeding species to extinction
3304686 i think he performed well today though he didnt get a gold medal
3304687 since he has participated in four games a bronze medal is an historical breakthrough for him
3304688 mr rudd must tell west australians whether the 134 000 job losses will occur in this state and if so where and in which parts of the economy and in which businesses
3304689 he has to answer why there was a 2 billion tax hike on gas condensate a 2 billion tax hike on the north west shelf which we believe will be passed onto domestic gas users in this state
3304690 and he must also answer why he has done nothing to reduce grocery or oil prices as he promised to do at the last election
3304691 mr rudd does have history of a relationship with brian burke that he tried to avoid in the lead up to the federal election
3304692 all those issues of his dealings with brian burke and how honest he was with the australian people about his relations with brian burke will be the focus of his visit here
3304693 weve already had five ministers resign since the last election how many more would be resigning if wed heard from the ccc on this governments shady dealings
3304694 its an olympic games pains irrelevant ive trained for so many years for this
3304695 my coach gave me a slap too anything to take the pain away from my back
3304696 its just the drive that got me through i suppose
3304697 ive had scans and everything it was decided that competing would cause no further damage
3304698 i struggled i had a back injury coming into the competition
3304699 if the situation had been different i would probably have pulled out a couple of weeks ago but there was nobody to replace me
3304700 i just tried to dig deep and get through the training so i could make it to beijing
3304701 i was in some discomfort in training and only managed to snatch up to 75kg in training and only clean and jerked 85kg
3304702 its not that the weights felt heavy the problem was the pain i was in
3304703 but after so many years of training to get this far i didnt want to pull out
3304704 its unknowable when a deal will be reached but the president is due back from zimbabwe later today
3304705 a zanu pf official said tsvangirai wanted a transfer of power to him and not a deal to share power
3304706 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3304707 the purpose of the operation has been achieved the security of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been restored
3304708 if we have received the order to cease fire this does not mean that we have stopped all actions including reconnaissance
3304709 prosecutors say their own informant stole millions of credit card numbers in a case that reveals how the internet is enabling new crimes on a vast scale
3304710 in the fourth quarter the economy is now seen expanding at a pace of just 0 3 percent a drop of 0 3 percentage point from july
3304711 said it will begin separating its troubled investment bank from its money management arm for the wealthy
3304712 nearly 60 per cent of us and european institutional investors surveyed by greenwich associates believe there will be such a failure within the next six months another 15 per cent think it will happen in six 12 months
3304713 its not worth it to own a car any more
3304714 its a waste of gas and a waste of time
3304715 i dont drive to kill time if we cant decide where were going i will pull over and turn my engine off
3304716 its expensive to fill up the jeep like over 100 its pretty bad
3304717 im so excited but i know i wont be able to drive much
3304718 now gas prices are insane and you cant drive around randomly and hybrid cars are expensive

3304720 possibly the finest view from a classroom in the world
3304721 in fact on going there today i discovered there was relatively little about dan dare but it was interesting to see the many exhibits illustrating various british products from the 50s a time when it appeared we could hold our own in the forefront of scientific and technological developments
3304722 i thought it would be nice to show them theres a community for people in their time of need
3304723 the furniture industry is global as it is the first thing we did was we took a look at the cost perspective of technology the tools that are available today we tried to think what kind of business could we set up using the tools
3304724 to do that we needed to continue to travel the system had to be workable from the road
3304725 fala s rio na e3 falaram que o desenvolvimento do jogo nem tinha sido
3304726 it was a magical and memorable spectacle and a great way to start the beijing olympics
3304727 they only planned on a week there which is a bit unusual as they still have some time together before he continues military training
3304728 will provide clarity and certainty to the consultation process under the endangered species act
3304729 i am deeply troubled by this proposed rule which gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3304730 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government this is not the type of legacy this interior department should be leaving for future generations
3304731 clearly thats a case of asking the fox to guard the chicken coop
3304732 a giant caution light that made federal agencies stop and think about the impacts of their actions
3304733 what the bush administration is telling those agencies is they dont have to think about those impacts anymore
3304734 because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3304735 so we dont inadvertently have the endangered species act seen as a back door to climate change policy that was never ever intended
3304736 clarity on an issue that if it was left broad and ambiguous could be a serious problem for the home building industry here in california
3304737 for home builders clarity in the rules is always always helpful
3304738 encouragement from both sides of the aisle to see if we couldnt bring about steps that would make the endangered species act more effective

3304750 were too good an offensive team to hit the way we have
3304751 all it takes is one pitch one swing one at bat to get going
3304752 the less you pull out the fewer problems you have
3304753 its just going to flow into the atlantic and get salty anyway
3304754 this is an isolated incident that had nothing to do with anything other than what can happen in any big city around the world if it had been some other random tourist we wouldnt even know anything about it maybe
3304755 so of course she got on the plane anyway and ill be happy to have them here you know youve just got to live your life you cant live in fear or anger about what happened
3304756 bad things happen in fort wayne ind where were from every day but we still go to coney island downtown we still go get gas still go to wal mart thats how you kind of have to live your life
3304757 they have told us not to do anything like that
3304758 you know at the olympics it could be anything it could be because you guys want an interview it could be a problem with tickets or logistics or practices we didnt know not until we got our therapy done and whatnot and saw the usoc people show up and the head of usa volleyball we knew something was wrong
3304759 we had lots of questions being only a couple hours since the incident they didnt have a lot of answers thats where most of the frustration came in were trying to make decisions in the next six hours people are supposed to fly here should we tell them to come not come was it something related to usa athletes or usa volleyball or a random act of violence which we now know obviously it was
3304760 we have no reason to believe that the assailant targeted the victims as american citizens
3304761 el objetivo de la operaci n para imponer la paz se ha cumplido la seguridad de las tropas de paz y de los ciudadanos rusos est garantizada

3304770 bill has gone through all the required channels now only is waiting for the finance minister to ask the speaker to move the bill
3304771 it will open investment of the pension money into the financial market that can optimise returns and cover them against high inflation levels
3304772 unless they have the numbers they wont bring it on the floor
3304773 all those who voted in the trust vote may not necessarily be wiling to vote for the bill
3304774 the new legislation has made consumers hesitant about jumping in
3304775 when youve got nowhere to aim for its difficult people are not feeling confident and are deciding to hold off
3304776 there is quite a bit of uncertainty there for buyers and its also frustrating for agents and vendors
3304777 some vendors have decided its the new laws more purchaser friendly than vendor friendly so were seeing a lot more choosing not to auction ive seen more agents across adelaide choosing not to auction and advising their clients accordingly
3304778 what it may have done is caused people to think twice about going to auction because of the uncertainty
3304779 agents and vendors are adopting a wait and see attitude
3304780 crowd numbers are down but thats more to do with the weather
3304781 go where christie youve been dragging me all over the place like a rag for the past few days lets rest

3304789 michelle is up singing love on the rocks very apt and after shes finished jd comes over to her and recognises her and shes really happy to see him
3304790 she used to be in a band with him years ago
3304791 i dont know if there used to be a little bit of something between them at one point you make up your back story in your head she invites him back to the rovers for a drink and of course steves there and he gets a bit jealous so she plays him along a bit and enjoys that shes wound him up she has no interest in jd in that respect he is just a friend she loves steve still and i think shes just trying to wind him up and teach him a lesson
3304792 i always love singing i enjoy doing it for charities and things like that but michelle hasnt sung for a long time on corrie so when they asked me to do it i was quite pleased because shes a barmaid now and people have forgotten that when
3304793 this isnt just a career for me its my passion

3304796 ive decided to finish the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace the safety of our peacekeeping forces and civilian population has been restored
3304797 the aggressor has been punished having sustained considerable losses its armed forces have been disorganised
3304798 should centres of resistance or other aggressive attempts arise you must take the decision to destroy them
3304799 wir glauben dass die entscheidung rechtliche fehler enth lt wir haben grund zur annahme dass die n chste instanz die fehler erkennen und in unserem sinne entscheiden wird

3304804 we got some good lessons out of that that we should get better i think we learned about the game speed and how fast youve got to play i dont think we played fast
3304805 those guys played a couple of plays and they were out
3304806 what we want to do is look at all those young guys and sometimes it isnt pretty but youve got to do it
3304807 im always looking for that deon anderson 10 special teams tackles in eight games last year he was a nobody and then we play and oh my gosh hes something else ive got to give all these guys a chance
3304808 there was a guy who fell in two summers ago

3304810 the popularity of the iphone along with the emergence of various applications and faster connectivity makes it an ideal platform for developing applications that incorporate quality real time voip
3304811 we are excited to enable the iphone with voip capabilities and lead the mobile communications market with our voice processing technology

3304814 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
3304815 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
3304816 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
3304817 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
3304818 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
3304819 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
3304820 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
3304821 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
3304822 this is a planning took where all things are going
3304823 while we have enjoyed service to st louis for many years chicago ohare will offer many more connecting options throughout the american airlines network
3304824 my goal is to try to get number one ranking back
3304825 i need to play well again i need to win the big matches thats what im looking at at the moment
3304826 what i dont like to do because you dont play so well is freak out and have emergency meetings thats not going to happen
3304827 being at the top doesnt mean number one in the world
3304828 it can mean deep into grand slams you know being in the top five top 10 for whatever 10 years 15 years just be up there and having a shot at grand slams
3304829 im not criticizing its just a fact with the olympic games everything shifted it made it really hard for us to have proper preparations
3304830 you start to doubt yourself just a touch even though i felt like i was playing well moving well
3304831 its just maybe for me a matter of just getting a bit more time on the hard courts
3304832 nous navons pas t assez bons en juin nous ne voulons pas passer trois autres ann es sans remporter quoi que ce soit notre quipe vaut plus que cela
3304833 these are some of the moves musharraf has so far finalised in his parleys with legal experts q league politicians and his sponsors abroad there are other options still being thrashed out for inclusion on the list
3304834 we are aware of all conspiracies musharraf is hatching let him do whatever he does he is only shooting at his own foot we are not deterred from our move to impeach him come what may musharraf is doomed to face the masses wrath we shall politically deal with whatever moves he makes where we are unable to stop him and hit back politically and legally the loss is to be incurred by musharraf and not us
3304835 any moment within these 72 hours is critical i can say that the loser is going to be the ruling ppp ml n coalition at least in the first phase the punjab governor is set to ask shahbaz sharif to seek a vote of confidence after the presidents move to destabilise him yields some results in this chaos anything can happen
3304836 it was deemed essential to give the resolution tabling process a political and moral tempo via resolutions in the provincial assemblies in support of impeachment but whatever the presidential quarters conceive and do would be harmful to them and not to us let him take whatever action he can we are not going to be the losers we win politically and morally his fate is going to be decided this way or that in this process
3304837 the vast majority of the worlds poor people live in extremely urban areas only a small percentage live in areas that are somewhat or extremely wild
3304838 even the rural poor mostly live in grasslands while biodiverse forests are largely empty
3304839 security of livelihoods is still vitally important for people that do live in such areas
3304840 like it or not conservation groups are going to have to improve the lot of local people if they want their programmes to succeed
3304841 the decision regarding making me jharkhand cm was taken long back but it is getting delayed hence we arrived at the decision to withdraw support for koda government if he does not resign now

3304855 the lower risk to the government rating reflects the companys worsening financial profile which is pressured by the continued home price declines in some of its key markets higher credit related expenses and capital challenges
3304856 that would place the nonsenior creditors of freddie mac at a greater risk of nonpayment especially the dividend payments on preferred stock
3304857 the record is there are massive giveaways and a lack of oversight

3304863 it is heartening to see someone finally coming out with a channel that reminds one of his roots

3304882 together these three papers represent a landmark week in schizophrenia genetics
3304883 this is an important step in helping to unravel the challenging biology of schizophrenia
3304884 the human dna blueprint consists of three billion letters of code most of which are the same between individuals but about 10 million of which can take at least two forms
3304885 these single nucleotide snp variations are scattered throughout the entire code and particular forms of the letters may either increase risk for a particular disease or be used as a signpost for nearby variations which cause disease
3304886 we were able to show in a very large sample that a snp within the znf804a gene on chromosome 2 was associated with an increased risk for schizophrenia
3304887 i would love to design one day i do not have the time right now but i would love to develop a home line or a clothing line so we will see what comes first
3304888 musharraf is standing alone today due to our political strategies because we have succeeded in conveying our message to the international community that stability in pakistan can only be possible through genuine democracy and not through dictatorship
3304889 we are constantly in contact with mr sherpao we are hopeful that his partys members will vote for the impeachment resolutions against president musharraf

3304901 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3304902 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3304903 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3304904 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3304905 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3304906 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3304907 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3304908 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3304909 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3304910 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3304911 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3304912 the countrys still pretty divided people may want a divided government they want change but im not sure that the democratic agenda has the support of a majority of americans

3304948 he was run over by his own cab and impaled underneath the engine by a piece of metal the piece of metal went three inches into his back
3304949 fire crews used specialist equipment to lift the cab and cut the man free
3304950 if we had not got to him he would almost certainly have died
3304951 it was a very challenging rescue and we had trauma technicians with the man while we freed him he was conscious and he was talking but he was a bit dazed

3304954 inflation is impacting on the economy differently in different sectors
3304955 food manufacturing for example is being squeezed leading to severe job losses
3304956 other sectors like oil and energy are printing inflation by hiking prices
3304957 even when their costs are falling they are slow to pass these lower prices to consumers
3304958 motorists can see that there is 7 to 8 pence difference per litre in the price of diesel between petrol stations across the country this is just a rip off

3304995 in these challenging times we are trying to use our experience to educate brokers about the benefits of
3304996 at the same time we are keen to make the wider market aware of a new entrant to the secured loans arena
3304997 if this promotion helps brokers to understand the products available in the market as well as letting them retain the same level of income as if they were dealing direct hopefully we can use it as a platform for growth
3304998 offering secured loans has always been part of our expansion plan and we have the capacity to distribute underwrite and process second charge products
3304999 we are offering a 63 per cent reduction to support mortgage brokers at a very difficult time and it will apply to both new and existing users our mortgage sourcing system is the most accurate in the uk and this is why brokers should use it but at a time when brokers are feeling the pinch we wanted to offer them the opportunity to reduce their expenditure
3305000 all brokers will be focusing on maximising revenue and minimising outgoings this is a great opportunity for brokers to switch to save money and with our leading mortgage sourcing system

3305015 stop the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace
3305016 we can hardly agree with this because it would assume the presence of people described as georgian peacekeepers

3305026 no hay dudas de que debemos tener el objetivo de limitar los cambios en la temperatura superficial media global de 2 c por encima del nivel preindustrial
3305027 pero dado que ste es un objetivo ambicioso y no sabemos en detalles como limitar las emisiones de gases invernadero para conseguir el objetivo de los dos grados deber amos estar preparados para adaptarnos a 4 c
3305028 mi percepci n es que si llegamos al aumento de los 4 grados es muy posible que comenz ramos a ver un incremento sin control
3305029 ning n otro factor centra las mentes del gabinete m s que el an lisis que hice comenzamos a hablar sobre la retirada ordenada de algunas reas de inglaterra porque se convierten en imposibles de defender
3305030 no hay elecci n entre adaptaci n y mitigaci n tenemos que hacer las dos
3305031 a 4 c estamos b sicamente en un r gimen clim tico diferentes
3305032 creo que es estar en una perspectiva peligrosa pensando sobre las implicaciones de 4 grados de calentamiento muestra que los impactos son tan significativos que la nica estrategia de adaptaci n real es evitarlo a cualquier precio porque va costar dolor y sufrimiento
3305033 no hay ciencia sobre como vamos a adaptarnos a un calentamiento de 4 grados de calentamiento es realmente muy alarmante
3305034 esto permitir a centrales t rmicas de carbono que se est n construyendo actualmente fueran modulares y capaces de modernizar la captura de carbono y mostrar an al mundo que nos tomamos el asunto del cambio clim tico seriamente de este modo demostramos un liderazgo real sin esta tecnolog a tenemos un problema real

3305039 this is the first time weve demonstrated a camera on a curved surface to really make it look like a human eye
3305040 if you simply bend it those materials are brittle like a ceramic bowl they break
3305041 this approach allows us to put electronics in places where we couldnt before
3305042 currently when you take photos the middle part of the picture is very clear but when you go to the edge it is not so clear
3305043 it really extends to all of the electronics that we use on humans you want to have a curved surface to fit the human body that is really the place it can be used
3305044 if you want to develop an eye to replace a human eye certainly you want the shape to look like a human eye survey shows photographers most satisfied with canon and nikon dslrs kodak forgets to mention the new easyshare z1015 is supports raw akbtravers

3305052 were not even realizing what an incredible athlete he is
3305053 obviously hes amazing and he breaks all these world records but i think being a part of that we almost take it for granted
3305054 i want to do things that no one else in the sport has ever done
3305055 it will remain to be seen where history ultimately places him but clearly today he is the best swimmer weve seen
3305056 he was very active and never stopped moving and it was kind of hard to harness that at first
3305057 its a little bit counterintuitive because even though he was so rambunctious as a young swimmer when he raced he was very focused
3305058 i always had dreams of being an olympian being a world record holder being a professional athlete being a gold medallist and i had to focus on those goals to achieve them and i knew that
3305059 i think he missed out on a normal progression of things but i wouldnt say hes missed anything
3305060 i would say he would tell you what hes gained has been a lot better than what hes missed
3305061 i would never trade going to the olympic games and standing on top of the medal podium or being able to turn professional or travel all over the world i would never trade any of it in
3305062 there are a lot of things that people havent done and i want to change the sport and be the first person to do new things
3305063 i have reached a decision to halt the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace
3305064 the aggressor has been punished and has incurred very significant losses its armed forces are disorganized
3305065 it is not part of our culture it is not what we do
3305066 we have a long history of enhancing call centre productivity with sophisticated contact centre applications direct integration with mitel is a further demonstration of the openness of our technology and our ongoing commitment to offering the most flexible options to our customers
3305067 gizmo is a relatively young company and the capability of inspirationcompact to expand and adapt to our growth surpassed all our expectations the solution let us pinpoint the areas needed for agent training and even helped managers outside of our contact center identify areas they could improve
3305068 whether this is down to better parental control the effect of media scare stories or just a growing understanding of the risks of social networking they are now actively managing their digital fingerprints or is the social networking explosion starting to wane
3305069 just as uk plc is bracing itself for the financial impact of post graduates that expect the latest and greatest gadgets and mobile access technologies so should universities
3305070 universities that want to lure the best students will need to invest heavily to implement an it infrastructure that will meet the expectations of this group and maintain their competitive edge in the race for securing higher student intake to meet this 150m price tag it is inevitable that universities will be looking to the government uk plc and possibly students to put their hands in their pockets
3305071 this survey is deliberately targeted at an age group that is being asked to choose its education and career path whilst this science statistic should worry uk plc and the governments of today and tomorrow the message is clear if we can educate them on the correlation between science and the gadgets they cant live without and spark their interest before choosing their gcse options we can influence the future of british industry
3305072 educators and private industry need to collaborate closely on how sciences are taught businesses worldwide are increasingly dependent upon technology to create new markets and achieve better margins technology is a lucrative thriving career option that seeks to drive down operational costs and increase innovation in a climate whereby the future careers of the realtime generation could be impacted by the credit crunch this is an opportune moment for the science and technology industry to reach out to this digital native workforce
3305073 anyone who is starting up a distribution company or any other company for that matter will know what its like to get things going and constantly have issues that threaten the survival of the business my vision of being a distributor with bite was being seriously undermined by a lack of appropriate it infrastructure
3305074 realising that i had to set up an it system that was both scalable and robust enough to cope with massive data needs with a limited budget gave me a big headache
3305075 a supplier needed to convince me that they could deliver what they promised i knew intercept were on my wavelength when they explained how the system was setup when it could be delivered and the simple cost per user per month pricing model i liked the aggressive approach to getting things done thats something i can relate to
3305076 we have been using onlinedesktop for some time now and its as reliable as our electricity supply it is always there and its always on we just take it for granted
3305077 i need things done correctly the first time and i want them done with minimal fuss and to high standards of excellence my customers are like that too they do not want to hang around and also want their needs to be fulfilled pretty quickly thats why i think i found a real winner with intercept i can work with them knowing that winning is their passion too
3305078 the online retail market is fiercely competitive consumers expect to be able to shop quickly and easily even minor glitches in this process will lead customers to abandon their trolleys and go elsewhere
3305079 to maintain its leadership position next has recognised the importance of enhancing the experience of every online visitor and providing them with the same superior level of service as they would expect in store or through next directory
3305080 local councils can find out the number and cause of avoidable contacts which is the first step to reducing them
3305081 the fact that simple transactions are increasingly satisfied by consumer self service internet and systems means person to person contacts tend to be more complex and take longer
3305082 reducing avoidable contact gives more capacity to handle unavoidable contacts more effectively and reduce overall workload
3305083 speech technology has reached a critical turning point where it is now fundamentally changing the way that we interact with the world around us
3305084 what was once a star trek dream is now a reality on our mobile phones in our cars on our navigation devices and now on the desktop with dragon with its near perfect accuracy and easy to use interface dragon has touched millions of people by creating a more productive and natural experience at the desktop theres no need to take time to train the software or learn arcane steps or commands anymore people can simply start talking and see their ideas flow directly onto the page it really is incredible to see
3305085 we are delighted to be supporting the mod in the reshaping of its future network and the wider c4istar strategy winning this work further highlights vegas expertise and leadership in
3305086 you know im one of richies closest friends and ive known him for years but even i have absolutely no clue what hes doing in the dj booth
3305087 one laptop is running traktor dj studio 3 and the other is running ableton live
3305088 theres so much new music to play with these days and my new set up allows me to take control of the music much more than say the typical dj setup of 2 turntables and a sampler
3305089 with my current setup i can search inside of a track find the parts i want to use and mix them
3305090 now i dont need to worry about outdated skills such as beat matching and i can fully focus and concentrate my attention on more creative details of the mix
3305091 people say that beatmatching is the art of djing but im sorry beat matching isnt really creative its just a skill
3305092 sure you can be pretty creative just by beat matching and cutting up records but i prefer to spend my time in the dj booth thinking about the construction of an interesting musical journey and less about timing two records together
3305093 i run loops delays and the beat repeat effect off traktor
3305094 i use ableton for loops and for its fx reverb flange and delay
3305095 i can nearly do anything with my current setup and i can run traktor loops through abletons fx or vice versa
3305096 but it can sometimes get a little hairy and you have to look out for feedback loops

3305268 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intent in georgia and the region
3305269 these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize relations with the united states and europe
3305270 if the united states and europe dont stop russia i think this is the end of what we thought of as the post soviet era
3305271 the russians feel they have been treated like dirt by the world for the last 20 years now theyre back
3305272 the combination is that the overall means with which weve dealt with the russians over the last two years have painted them into a corner so that its difficult for them not to see us as hostile
3305273 is pushing the envelope too far for groups representing the mentally disabled
3305274 when i heard about it i felt really hurt inside
3305275 i cannot believe a writer could write something like that its the not the way that we want to be portrayed we have feelings we dont like the word retard we are people were just like any other people out there we want to be ourselves and not be discriminated against
3305276 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive

3305295 i cant remember the last time i played that much it felt good to get out there and banging heads with people and playing with the guys
3305296 ive said it before i think this is a big year for mac
3305297 at the least i saw a guy who was getting upfield and getting after the passer
3305298 hes kind of climbed the ladder and then he had a setback
3305299 that happens hes come out and hes played well hes put all that behind him he feels good and he seems to be playing productive football
3305300 first of all you just want to get them out there working
3305301 he hasnt played yet hopefully hes going to be ready to go thursday night were going to play him quite a bit hes just got to get used to that playing speed with us and getting used to the defense
3305302 hes going to go against a couple of good receivers this week hell be up to the task he just needs to make sure hes comfortable with the defense
3305303 it couldve been great in his situation hes finally maturing at age 35 sometimes its you sometimes its me he thought for so long it was someone else but at some point maybe it dawns on you that its not everyone elses fault
3305304 the plunge in the gold price has come perfectly in time to ignite demand ahead of diwali and the wedding season
3305305 the falling price of the yellow metal is attracting customers buying pressure has intensified in the last two days as many are shopping in advance for marriage
3305306 for a guy that really played with a lot of pain and injury he did a good job johnson said
3305307 im happy with him happy with his progress he just needs to play more
3305308 im a little banged up small injuries here and there laws said
3305309 i felt i did pretty good i made some decent plays tons to work on a lot of good film to study
3305310 i can change things last second i can tell him personnel are coming onto the field i can tell him down and distance youd have to talk to him but i think he likes it
3305311 ironing some kinks out we ended up changing the headset jim was using went from wired to wireless i could hear better on the wireless the wired set was picking up a lot more crowd noise
3305312 with the hand signals the corners can kind of stay out away from the huddle which cuts down on their running time just a little
3305313 now they have to come in the huddle so its going to be a little adjustment period for those guys
3305314 im happy with him i think we had maybe just one mistake as far as when he was playing in there but he did a pretty good job overall
3305315 legs werent the most fresh but i felt pretty good
3305316 first of all you just want to get them out there working
3305317 he needs to play a little he hasnt played yet hopefully hes going to be ready to go thursday night were going to play him quite a bit hes just got to get used to that playing speed with us and get used to the defense thats the main thing
3305318 id probably put him at 90 to 95 percent well have to see how tired he gets because thats what you worry about with the hamstring if he gets tired thats when you have to worry about a pull
3305319 any time you have a preseason game you take the good and the bad
3305320 i dont think we did a good job on the blitz as they scored a touchdown and there were a couple things where we just didnt have really good outside run support
3305321 there are some good things too i just hate to see anybody take the ball down the field and score but it was a team that we hadnt worked on that much and it surprised us a little bit how they would run the ball that much am i disappointed the way we played sure that series
3305322 we had a blitz on and i think he just underestimated holmes speed and wasnt quite in a good position to make the tackle
3305323 we had some problems last year and we kind of got away from that a little bit if it happens again yeah ill be worried but im not now
3305324 just like we had a good opening drive offensively and almost took it down except for a penalty those things happen in the first game disappointed yeah but im not too concerned right now if it continues like that ill be disappointed
3305325 both of them told me how hard it was to cut him because of how much integrity they felt he had
3305326 that meant more to me than any of the super bowl rings he has
3305327 if he had told me he wanted me to play safety or something i might have been upset but when he told me he wanted to go back to d line it wasnt a big deal
3305328 of course i wanted to see how the fullback experiment would have went but thats coach reids call
3305329 i havent seen enough fullback play to know how i was doing coach reid has seen a lot more than me he had a feel that maybe this wasnt going to be the right spot and i respect that
3305330 he was disappointed but danny is the kind of guy who tends to ask me what i think of stuff
3305331 i told him that he might have the quickness that defensive coordinator jim johnson is looking for i told him this is a team where you can really fit in he tends to take my opinion and run with it i know he really wanted to try the experiment and then all of a sudden bam its gone but he knew he couldnt be disappointed too long
3305332 im not everybodys cup of tea in the nfl but hopefully when i get on the field i can show them differently
3305333 i know im not the biggest guy down there but im a little quicker i feel i use my hands well
3305334 hes done a good job hes going to play a lot more thursday night but hes done a good job
3305335 my first two seasons in new england we won 28 games lost four and won two super bowls
3305336 coming from temple where you didnt win much of all and going to a team where all of sudden youre setting a record by winning 21 straight games thats pretty crazy it doesnt get much better than that

3305340 het is prachtig om te zien hoe zoveel getalenteerde mensen belangeloos hun tijd en inzet doneren aan onemen samen met hen en de donateurs kunnen wij de pioniers zoveel m r helpen in hun strijd voor rechtvaardigheid
3305341 een koptelefoon vraagt mensen te luisteren ik wil ervoor zorgen dat ze luisteren naar de pioniers van onemen want zij hebben een indrukwekkend verhaal te vertellen
3305342 onemen spreekt mij aan omdat zij een stichting zijn die concrete middelen geven spullen die ze hard nodig hebben en dus niet alleen geld waarvan je moeilijk kan traceren wat ermee gebeurt ik hoefde dus niet lang na te denken toen ik gevraagd werd voor deze shoot

3305356 banyak sekali pelanggaran yang terjadi saat pelaksanaan kampanye lalu terutama pada hari terakhir kampanye saat itu banyak sekali guru atau pns yang terlibat dalam kegiatan itu namun hingga kini tidak ada sama sekali tindakan tegas dari panwaslu karena itu akan lebih baik jika lembaga panwaslu dibubarkan saja

3305395 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3305396 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3305397 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3305398 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

3305410 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3305411 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3305412 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3305413 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3305414 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3305415 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3305416 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3305417 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3305418 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3305419 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3305420 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3305421 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3305422 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3305423 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3305424 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3305425 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3305426 estoy s per orgulloso de lo que he luchado y trabajado por llegar hasta aqu soy consciente de que tengo nivel de medalla pero hoy no ha sido el d a hemos conseguido ser competitivos la pena que tengo es que pod a haber hecho un poco m s mi sue o era llegar a una final ol mpica y me he quedado a un paso as que espero que dentro de cuatro a os pueda cumplir el sue o
3305427 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3305428 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3305429 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3305430 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3305431 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3305432 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3305433 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3305434 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3305435 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3305436 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3305437 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3305438 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3305439 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3305440 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3305441 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3305442 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3305443 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3305444 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3305445 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3305446 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3305447 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3305448 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3305449 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3305450 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3305451 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3305452 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3305453 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3305454 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3305455 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3305456 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3305457 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3305458 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3305459 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3305460 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3305461 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3305462 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3305463 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3305464 who are open to doing something on the production side
3305465 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3305466 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3305467 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3305468 i was running a fever of 104 degrees and it was hard to breathe i was weak and i couldnt sweat it off
3305469 its hard because a lot of people dont understand what im going through these days nobody has heard of sarcoidosis nobody knows anything about it
3305470 i was like oh my goodness could that happen to me
3305471 the medications you take suppress your immune system and then you get staph infections fungal infections and bacterial infections
3305472 having this disease with the funny name that no one knows about you feel very isolated
3305473 i couldnt talk id be coughing so hard and itd go on for 15 or 20 minutes they kept giving me stuff and none of it would help
3305474 im sorry to see him gone but hes bringing a lot of awareness of sarcoidosis to the forefront and thats a good thing
3305475 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3305476 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3305477 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3305478 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3305479 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3305480 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3305481 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3305482 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3305483 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3305484 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3305485 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3305486 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3305487 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3305488 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

3305493 i was in very bad shape i wouldnt advise anyone to drink that much

3305514 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3305515 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3305516 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3305517 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3305518 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3305519 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3305520 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3305521 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

3305526 we respect the fact they are a really good side but were looking forward to taking them on
3305527 we think and we know we can beat them for us its a big challenge
3305528 were not going to be intimidated by them but were going to go out there and give it a crack and look forward to it
3305529 im really looking forward to the game and i know the guys are you see a really big challenge against a team like this and one that could really shape our season
3305530 weve been pretty lucky with the way the results have fallen and now the ball is firmly in our court with three games to go
3305531 if we can win two or three of them we can really get ourselves up for another crack at it
3305532 its up to us now theres no excuses and theres no point on relying on other games weve had our luck in that respect its up to us
3305533 geelong are doing everything right and certainly look on course to put their name out there in respect to teams like that
3305534 were happy to take them on wherever i think anz stadium is going to be really good its going to be a finals type atmosphere on the ground and if we can get a big crowd out there it should help
3305535 its a good question hopefully roosy swans coach paul roos has got a few things to tell us this week a few secrets
3305536 they are just one of those sides that they havent got any real major weaknesses you can pick out they are really good all over the field
3305537 they dont rely on any one forward and as a defence coming in against a team like that it makes it pretty difficult to plan
3305538 theyve got threats everywhere and probably one of the biggest advantage of our defence is we can be pretty versatile and we are going to have to be this week
3305539 both countries will also cooperate through exercises and operations in areas such as humanitarian and disaster relief search and rescue and peace support
3305540 demonstrates the importance both countries place on bilateral military interactions and the political support from both countries for the various training arrangements between their armed forces

3305546 they have made it possible for us to observe large areas of the ocean under the sea ice in winter for the first time
3305547 the sea ice causes problems for us in terms of observing the ocean in that it makes ship observation very expensive and slow
3305548 satellites cant see the ocean through the ice and the profiling floats we are using throughout the worlds oceans now are also unable to surface through the ice and transmit their data by satellite
3305549 the sea ice is important for climate because it is bright and reflects the suns energy back into space so if we have less sea ice the earth tends to absorb more energy and so warm up
3305550 weve never been able to measure how much sea ice is actually forming before and the seal data is allowing us to do that for the first time
3305551 we will be instrumenting a total of about 160 seals both in the arctic and antarctic using several different species of seal because different seals go to different places to feed so we can get information from different parts of the ocean
3305552 the celebration of the independence day of india the worlds largest democracy in the heart of boston the cradle of liberty will be an enjoyable and memorable family event we expect over 15 000 people to attend this year

3305559 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
3305560 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
3305561 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
3305562 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
3305563 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
3305564 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
3305565 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
3305566 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
3305567 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
3305568 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
3305569 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
3305570 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
3305571 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
3305572 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
3305573 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
3305574 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
3305575 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
3305576 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
3305577 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
3305578 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
3305579 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
3305580 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
3305581 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
3305582 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
3305583 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
3305584 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
3305585 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
3305586 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
3305587 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
3305588 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
3305589 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
3305590 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
3305591 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
3305592 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
3305593 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
3305594 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
3305595 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
3305596 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
3305597 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
3305598 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
3305599 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
3305600 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
3305601 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
3305602 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
3305603 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
3305604 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings
3305605 the human race has improved everything except the human race adlai stephenson
3305606 earth provides enough to satisfy every mans need but not every mans greed
3305607 if you tremble indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine
3305608 people have asked me how many sales braid needs in order to be profitable the answer is a lot more than it has gotten so far there are many reasons for this which i may be motivated to talk about in the future however things are looking promising now if braid keeps selling ill be able to afford to make the next game and that will be good
3305609 its obvious that they want to use this as evidence for the guernsey court to continue extending a freeze on a bnp paribas account belonging to my client
3305610 we see the accusations as defamation against my client so we have decided to countersue
3305611 intelligence sources led coalition forces to the location of a suspected kataib hezbollah associate believed to be in control of at least one terrorist cell
3305612 in looking at the charge i think the charge was fair considering the tackle
3305613 he had some loading and that sort of thing as well so when you really look at it three games hes probably pretty lucky
3305614 its disappointing for everyone because at this stage of the season youd like to have everyone available particularly the smarter players your better players and your senior players
3305615 with respect to parramatta i think the roosters were a little unlucky in many ways i was at the game live and i think they got some tough calls
3305616 if anthony tupou puts the ball down with a minute to go they probably win the game
3305617 parramatta played alright but im comfortable the way were travelling the last few games also
3305618 were not afraid to play this side next monday night and im certainly not going to add to any fear by telling them weve lost six in a row thats a very negative attitude
3305619 plenty of sides have shown they can beat parramatta and were no different
3305620 okay we havent had a lot of wins against them but theres plenty of teams we havent had a lot of wins against like penrith melbourne
3305621 what happened second half last week let alone last year five years ago means nothing if you worry about putting your left shoe on before you put your right shoe on because youre superstitious and you start letting those things get into your head we dont worry about those things
3305622 up until now people thought that the tasmanian mega fauna had actually gone extinct before people arrived on the island
3305623 things were very climatically stable in that part of australia and yet the mega fauna still managed to go extinct
3305624 so its down to humans of one sort or another
3305625 a lot of people still have in their minds an axe wielding spear wielding people bloodthirsty out there slaughtering all over the place it wasnt like that at all
3305626 it was basically just one joey baby kangaroo in the pot for christmas and thats all youve got to go to do to drive slow breeding species to extinction
3305627 mr rudd must tell west australians whether the 134 000 job losses will occur in this state and if so where and in which parts of the economy and in which businesses
3305628 he has to answer why there was a 2 billion tax hike on gas condensate a 2 billion tax hike on the north west shelf which we believe will be passed onto domestic gas users in this state
3305629 and he must also answer why he has done nothing to reduce grocery or oil prices as he promised to do at the last election
3305630 mr rudd does have history of a relationship with brian burke that he tried to avoid in the lead up to the federal election
3305631 all those issues of his dealings with brian burke and how honest he was with the australian people about his relations with brian burke will be the focus of his visit here
3305632 weve already had five ministers resign since the last election how many more would be resigning if wed heard from the ccc on this governments shady dealings
3305633 by formalising the jua kali channel we will be able to take them out of the informal sector and help them to join the formal sector
3305634 i shall tell you whether we can become champions after the 27th and final round has been played
3305635 we are on the right track if the players keep believing were going to make it then we will im sure of that
3305636 it continues with the theme weve been seeing from bank executives where theyre talking about no signs of real improvement in terms of the economic and financial trends
3305637 saakashvilis brutal actions undermined georgias confidence we do not feel any confidence to saakashvili
3305638 my wife was a porn star what should i do
3305639 there are children it was a shotgun marriage and i think i can pretend i dont know i wasnt really sure it was her but there is a mole that checks out you see i think i should check the identity out but im scared to do so do you think i should try asking her friends
3305640 to a greater or lesser extent there is nobody who doesnt have this kind of fault or indiscretion in their past i think the most important thing is how we use that past experience in how we live our lives from here on
3305641 if you really must check then it would absolutely be best to ask her directly asking her friends why its almost as though you dont trust her
3305642 but if you really do love your wife i think if you kept quiet about the fact you knew in spite of knowing that would make you a very manly splendid husband to her
3305643 is she not no different to an amateur with a great experience of men
3305644 if the children knew it would a great shock cant you please keep it to yourself for their sakes
3305645 if you cant forgive her at least leave her without telling her the reason why
3305646 when your kids are grown up watch it with them
3305647 reading the selected answer just makes me want to puke
3305648 how the hell can he trust her now just split up already
3305649 whats wrong with her thinking she can just marry as if nothing happened
3305650 if she just kept quiet about it and married him then shes the worst kind of woman eh
3305651 well i might be able to let a spot of delivery health pass but av is a bit much
3305652 anyway tell us the name of the damn video already
3305653 my girlfriend performs in eroge but i dont say anything and i love her
3305654 if there werent any kids itd be an insta divorce
3305655 why on earth did such a pompous and high and mighty answer get selected as best
3305656 if it was a shotgun marriage just to cover up for getting her pregnant then hes reaping what hes sown
3305657 with so many upright women in the world the first thing he should do is get rid of this wretched one
3305658 husband youve been in an av then wife eh what are you talking about husband here look at this wife wow look at that amazing she looks just like me
3305659 im interested in what the reaction would be if she were to come in on you whilst you were masturbating to the dvd
3305660 if this were an ero manga shed be chasing after her sons friends for sex
3305661 the project root directory seems not to be under subversion control
3305662 the report highlights the differences between prices paid by australian consumers and consumers in other countries when roaming overseas to a range of popular business and tourist destinations
3305663 the mobile telecommunications industry is understandably very concerned that a very limited analysis of this kind must be read with a full understanding and clear disclosure of the constraints of its information sources and the conclusions heavily qualified to avoid a totally misleading impression of the actual situation
3305664 unfortunately jet lag is not the only thing that knocks over australians when they return from abroad they can also be floored by their mobile phone bills
3305665 australias future will also depend on our ability to engage constructively and effectively with the countries of the asia pacific
3305666 that is why i am committed to making australia the most asia literate country in the collective west
3305667 by investing in asian languages and cultural education in australias schools my vision is for the next generation of australians businessmen and women economists accountants lawyers architects artists film makers and performers to develop language skills which open their region to them
3305668 australia amp squo s future will also depend on our ability to engage constructively and effectively with the countries of the asia pacific
3305669 it is my understanding that the methodology used in the cpsc study may have been flawed as such the reports conclusion may have been premature providing less than adequate rationale to conclude
3305670 staff recognizes that some conditions such as age weathering exposure to sunlight and wear and tear might change the amount of lead that could be released from the turf as turf is used during athletics or play and exposed over time to sunlight heat and other weather conditions the surface of the turf may start to become worn and small particles of the lead containing synthetic grass fibers might be released
3305671 cpsc staff finds synthetic turf fields ok to install ok to play on
3305672 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3305673 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3305674 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3305675 the advance casts doubts on russias claim that this five day war is just a peacekeeping operation
3305676 this war is all about russia and the message russias sending to the world this is putins announcement that russia is back as a great power
3305677 we have to understand these russian troops didnt materialize out of nowhere
3305678 this is the culmination of putins efforts to pull georgia back within russias sphere and exert control over it
3305679 i am getting a little bit sick and tired of what were seeing a battle of words from left and right
3305680 it is a concern and ill certainly be raising it with the organisation
3305681 spelarna r f rh rda men vi m ste vara noggranna
3305682 we are always looking for new ways to raise the bar and deliver outstanding customer service
3305683 we are intrigued by the prospect of enhanced inventory visibility and we think this can be of real value to our customers and store associates
3305684 we are eager to begin this test to explore the benefits that rfid can provide in our retail footwear locations
3305685 rfid has interested us for some time and we believe it has reached the point where launching a pilot program of this nature makes sense we are also pleased to be working with our chosen partners on this project and we look forward to the support and expertise we are confident they will provide

3305691 it may not be location that is connecting these sexual assaults
3305692 we are feeling it is a planned incident each time
3305693 we believe theres a man out there who wants to commit sexual assaults and it doesnt matter how old the woman is
3305694 i think it really highlights what the chinese authorities are willing to do to silence people
3305695 the damage to that truck makes it highly unlikely the driver survived
3305696 he must have been going at least 150 kmh at least that fast he was in the right hand lane and all of a sudden he turned left on to this rocky road and he went right over the hill didnt even hit any of the trees and went right into the water nose first
3305697 these situations are always difficult for emergency crews because were here to help and being in a holding pattern like we are is always a challenge
3305698 if this person was severely intoxicated they would have difficulty coming up with a story like that off the cuff
3305699 it is very disappointing data with widespread signs of higher price pressures
3305700 it will undoubtedly convince some members of the monetary policy committee to vote for higher rates but we doubt they will reach a majority
3305701 ich bin sehr gl cklich dar ber wie die mannschaft im sommer die testspiele absolviert hat vor allem gegen manchester united fc
3305702 wir haben unsere defensivst rke zur geltung gebracht und gegen den uefa champions league sieger einen harten test bestanden besser kann man sich auf artmedia nicht vorbereiten und wir k nnen wieder auf gianluigi buffon z hlen er gibt der mannschaft viel qualit t
3305703 f r mich wird das eine gro e erfahrung wie nat rlich f r die ganze mannschaft ich bin erst 21 das letzte mal als artmedia in der gruppenphase der champions league gespielt hat sa ich nur auf der bank nun stehe ich im tor ich werde den moment genie en wenn ich auf dem rasen neben einer legende wie gianluigi buffon stehe
3305704 sie haben eine gro e mannschaft mit tollen einzelspielern aber wir wollen dort um unsere chance k mpfen nicht nur ein trainingspartner sein wir wollen die berraschung schaffen

3305711 this is phase three of her transformation which began in 2005
3305712 shes booked in for a consultation to see if anything can be done about her arms
3305713 theres an operation you can have to remove excess skin from your armpits this can happen to women who exercise and diet too much

3305725 the situation in georgia is very difficult because russia is doing everything possible to occupy the country
3305726 the cold war has long ended but the mentality of the cold war has stayed firmly in the minds of several u s diplomats
3305727 completed a significant part of the operations to oblige georgia the georgian authorities to restore peace to south ossetia
3305728 we left behind all the equipment in the hospital and 80 bodies in the morgue
3305729 if tbilisi comes under threat i will inform the residents 12 hours in advance
3305730 we wont touch the citizens but we will liquidate anyone in uniform
3305731 if the georgian troops dont take advantage of this opportunity then an operation to eliminate them will begin
3305732 georgia in a way is suffering for all that happened to russia in the last 20 years
3305733 washington and the administration are playing an extremely dirty game
3305734 they will show putin as an occupier even if putin is doing nothing
3305735 he is playing the game which is designed by putin
3305736 now he can cruise the volga for all the remaining years or can go right to the bahamas
3305737 i must admit that for the first time in my life i felt admiration for the skill with which vladimir putin maintains his power
3305738 i would say you have a situation in which the russians have come to the red line
3305739 if we catch them in the toilet well rub them out in the outhouse
3305740 i will recommend to conduct the operation so that nothing on you will grow again
3305741 he has such a visceral attitude toward saakashvili that that seems to drown out anything else that anyone says to him
3305742 nosotros reivindicamos un aumento de 50 mil pesos 100 d lares al salario de 380 mil pesos que tenemos 760 d lares contamos con bonos de asistencia y puntualidad de 60 mil pesos mensuales m s de 100 d lares que por un atraso de 5 minutos dejan de pagarse simplemente esta es una infamia considerando que esos mismos trabajadores est n dispuestos a trabajar m s de 2 horas fuera de las extras legales s lo deber amos trabajar 45 horas semanales sin embargo hacemos entre 50 y 80 horas extras mensuales el sacrificio del conductor no se refleja en la liquidaci n de fin de mes aqu la empresa est metiendo la mano al bolsillo de los conductores

3305745 juan pinto zamora que adem s es militante socialista y gobiernista l no ha querido conversar con nosotros la ltima negociaci n fue v a telef nica y absolutamente negativa nosotros exigimos que los 860 trabajadores que participamos en el movimiento m s del 75 de los conductores de la empresa contemos con inmunidad fuero para no ser despedidos arbitrariamente
3305746 la empresa ha llamado a las esposas de los conductores y varios trabajadores han terminado en el hospital por problemas card acos producto del amedrentamiento mafioso del empleador la empresa habla de 520 despedidos pero hasta el momento las cartas s lo han sido cursadas y todav a no se hacen efectivas queremos que el gobierno intervenga en el proceso
3305747 un a o atr s cuando las bases de licitaci n afectaban a los due os de los operadores del transantiago el gobierno intervino y las cambi r pidamente
3305748 claro pero los recursos que se inyectan quedan en manos de los due os cuando somos los conductores quienes movilizamos a la gente y a la econom a

3305751 we feel that the use of the word retard throughout the film 15 or more times is done without any regard for the dignity of people with intellectual disabilities
3305752 the caricatures of people with intellectual disabilities are you know almost hateful and we want this to be the beginning of the end we want this to be the end of hollywood treating this population as the butt of jokes
3305753 thats the great thing you know if i want to protest something because it offends me thats my right as an american and its also any artists right to say and do whatever they want to do
3305754 we have had productive discussions with representatives of disability advocacy organizations and look forward to working with them closely in the future
3305755 however no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3305756 tropic thunder is an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations
3305757 its been a rough couple of days best way to describe it is we are trying to get through it
3305758 shes not out of the woods by any means but it seems like we are heading in the right direction
3305759 ive been in touch with family in new zealand and i know that its support there and im very grateful for that
3305760 we are a team with a chance the last international team this year and maybe still have some momentum going into these olympics

3305776 in addition to the xfe models gm already offers hybrid versions of the tahoe and yukon that achieve up to a 50 percent improvement in city fuel economy and coming in the first half of 2009 are the silverado and sierra hybrids
3305777 these hybrid pickups offer up to 25 percent overall increased fuel economy and greater than 40 percent improved mileage in city driving

3305785 minister hahn hat in seinem aber auch weit ber sein ressort hinaus viel f r wien geleistet nicht zuletzt f r den ausbau des wirtschaftsstandortes aber auch den gesamten bildungsbereich auch der wiener sp sollte das klar sein wenn sie es auch in wahlzeiten vielleicht nicht wahrhaben will
3305786 das kann auch sp klubobmann oxonitsch gerne im offiziellen geb hrenspiegel der stadt wien nachschlagen
3305787 die wiener kinderg rten sind die teuersten in sterreich daran ndert auch der verzweifelte hinweis des sp klubobmanns auf die angeblich so sozialen gestaffelten beitr ge nichts
3305788 so etwas als sozial zu bezeichnen zeigt wie weit sich die wiener sp vom alltag der familien und allgemein der wienerinnen und wiener entfernt hat
3305789 ein durchschnittliche r arbeitnehmerin muss mindestens 2 149 euro brutto verdienen um im falle von arbeitslosigkeit ein einkommen ber der inflationsbereinigten armutsgrenze zu bekommen
3305790 mehr als 60 prozent der arbeitnehmerinnen verdienen weniger und sind armutsgef hrdet wenn sie ihren job verlieren am h rtesten trifft das frauen denn mehr als drei viertel verdienen unter 2 149 euro
3305791 diese spirale setzt sich fort frauen arbeiten oft als geringf gig besch ftigte und teilzeitkr fte diese sind leicht austauschbar und dadurch besonders h ufig von arbeitslosigkeit betroffen
3305792 neben einer inflationsanpassung bei arbeitslosengeld und notstandshilfe sowie einer umfassenden steuerreform einer produktivit tsorientierten lohnpolitik und einer verringerten besteuerung von lebensmitteln sind f r uns investitionen in eine aktive arbeitsmarktpolitik mit der chance auf um und neuorientierung am wichtigsten
3305793 viele frauen wollen eine aus und weiterbildung machen fehlende kinderbetreuungseinrichtungen unzureichende ffentliche verkehrsmittel und geringes arbeitslosengeld sind allerdings stolpersteine die wir rasch beseitigen m ssen wohnungskosten strom und heizkosten und nahrungsmittel jene grundbed rfnisse die zudem noch am meisten von der teuerungsrate betroffen sind behindern vor allem frauen an einer neuorientierung

3305796 jetzt m ssen auch die entlastungsangebote f r pflegende angeh rige ausgebaut werden nur 5 der pflegegeldbezieher ben tigen rund um die uhr betreuung
3305797 mit der erh hung der f rderungen und des pflegegeldes sowie dem wegfall der verm gensgrenze gibt es im bereich 24 stunden betreuung keinen grund mehr warum familien sich die betreuung auf dem schwarzmarkt besorgen m ssen
3305798 das wichtigste problem n mlich f r die gro e mehrheit der betroffenen familien eine deutliche verbesserung und ein sterreichweites gesamtpaket pflege und betreuung zu schaffen ist damit aber noch nicht gel st denn wir d rfen nicht vergessen dass nur etwa 5 aller pflege und betreuungsbed rftigen personen die 24 stunden betreuung in anspruch nehmen 80 der pflege und betreuungsbed rftigen menschen in sterreich werden von angeh rigen gepflegt zum teil mit unterst tzung mobiler dienste die brigen in heimen
3305799 die heute beschlossene pflegegelderh hung ist zwar ein wichtiger schritt in die richtige richtung wir fordern jedoch auch einen massiven ausbau der entlastungsangebote f r pflegende angeh rige n mlich mobile dienste teilstation re einrichtungen wie tageszentren und urlaubspflege denn in diesem bereich sind die f rderungen f r die tr ger und die unterst tzung f r die pflegenden familienangeh rige unzureichend kurz gesagt viele familien k nnen sich trotz pflegegeld viele angebote kaum leisten weil diese zu wenig gef rdert werden oder es gibt diese angebote mangels f rderung gar nicht
3305800 nun muss alles getan dass in der neuen bundesregierung das richtig erkannte ziel aufgegriffen wird pflege und betreuung aus der sozialhilfelogik heraus zu bringen es muss zur bestimmenden handlungsanleitung f r die erarbeitung eines sterreichweiten gesamtkonzeptes pflege und betreuung gemacht werden denn es kann nicht sein dass man als pflegebed rftiger mensch in sterreich zuerst zum sozialfall werden muss bevor die gesamte palette der unterst tzung greift man muss sich im klaren sein dass dies noch viel geld kosten wird doch die betroffenen familien haben mehr anerkennung und entlastung verdient
3305801 die sterreichische werbebranche lie sich von negativmeldungen nicht verunsichern sondern zeigt einen soliden optimismus
3305802 dass sich sowohl die agenturen als auch die werbetreibende wirtschaft mit mehr als 55 prozent deutlich optimistisch zeigen
3305803 gefragt nach der entwicklung der werbeaktivit ten im 2 quartal 2008 in sterreich sind 51 8 prozent der agenturen und 45 6 prozent der werbetreibenden wirtschaft der meinung dass die werbebudgets im vergleich zum gleichen quartal des vorjahres zumindest gleich geblieben sind 40 prozent der werbetreibenden und 36 2 prozent der agenturen haben sogar einen anstieg der werbebudgets verzeichnet
3305804 nur 29 1 prozent der agenturen und 28 8 prozent der werbetreibenden rechnen mit einer zunahme der werbeaktivit ten in den n chsten zw lf monaten ein f nftel geht sogar von einer reduktion aus
3305805 72 1 prozent der verbraucherinnen konsumieren zumindest fallweise fernsehwerbung 64 7 prozent sehen sich flugbl tter und prospekte an
3305806 auch liegen plakatwerbung radiowerbung und werbung als zeitungsbeilage bei rund 40 prozent hoch im kurs
3305807 wichtig ist den konsumenten ebenfalls dass werbebotschaften kurz und pr gnant sind
3305808 sehr wohl sind sich die menschen auch der tatsache bewusst dass werbung f r unsere wirtschaft wichtig ist und arbeitspl tze sichert
3305809 einig sind sich die heimischen experten im internationalen vergleich sterreichs mit anderen l ndern aufholbedarf herrscht in sterreich was online werbung im zusammenhang mit dem gesamtetat betrifft
3305810 die marktbedingungen werden schwieriger doch gerade der sich versch rfende wettbewerb wird als chance f r die branche gewertet ein personalabbau ist aber trotz der verhaltenen erwartungen nicht in sicht ein drittel der agenturen plant sogar personelle erweiterungen
3305811 wir m ssen uns darauf einstellen dass die generelle wirtschaftsentwicklung nachlassen wird und damit ein st rkerer wettbewerb auf uns zukommt aber ich bin berzeugt dass die sterreichische werbe und kommunikationsbranche darauf sehr gut vorbereitet ist und der wirtschaft weiterhin positive wirtschaftliche impulse geben wird
3305812 die verbesserungen f r demenzkranke und kinder sind besonders wichtig
3305813 vor allem die verbesserungen f r die betreuung von menschen die an demenziellen erkrankungen leiden sind ein wichtiger schritt f r die verbesserung der lebensqualit t der patientinnen und der pflegenden angeh rigen ebenso wie die verbesserungen f r die betreuung von kindern
3305814 die erh hung der f rderung in der 24h stunden betreuung macht das modell f r mehr menschen leistbar
3305815 allerdings erneuern wir die forderung nach einer gesamtl sung f r alle pflegebed rftigen menschen in sterreich nur rund 5 der pflegebed rftigen werden in einer 24h stunden l sung betreut die angeh rigen der restlichen 95 haben auch ein recht auf eine sichere und leistbare l sung diese gilt es in form einer pflegeversicherung oder einer fondl sung zu entwickeln

3305818 so hat zum beispiel das land nieder sterreich schon zu beginn des heurigen jahres die pendlerhilfe erh ht um die tausenden pendler zu unterst tzen
3305819 in den vergangenen jahren gab es auch keine erh hung beim strom und gaspreis durch die evn auch eine ma nahme um die nieder sterreicherinnen und nieder sterreich zu entlasten

3305826 k rnten hatte damit einen st rkeren r ckgang zu verzeichnen als es sterreichweit der fall war
3305827 mit gro er trauer und best rzung haben wir die nachricht vom tod des gr ten kulturpolitikers der sozialdemokratie der letzten jahrzehnte aufgenommen fred sinowatz verdankt die kulturelle entwicklung sterreichs unendlich viel f r alle wesentlichen neuerungen der letzten vier jahrzehnte wurden die fundamente w hrend seiner amtszeit als kultur und unterrichtsminister gelegt sowohl die bildungsexplosion der 70er jahre als auch die kulturelle ffnung und erneuerung w re ohne sein wirken nicht m glich gewesen bei einer diskussion der sterreichischen gesellschaft f r kulturpolitik mit ihm zu seinem 75 geburtstag konnten sich viele davon berzeugen wie sehr er auch in den letzten jahren regen anteil an allem kulturpolitischen damit eigentlich am allem politischen nahm und wir zitieren ihn selbst irgendwann wird alle politik einmal zur kulturpolitik er wird uns allen stets vorbild und leitfaden bleiben
3305828 wir m ssen einerseits die auswirkungen der inflation auf die bev lkerung mildern und haben deshalb in diesem jahr bereits ein gesamtentlastungsvolumen von ber 1 3 mrd euro umgesetzt bzw in planung
3305829 gleichzeitig m ssen aber auch die ursachen der hausgemachten inflationsfaktoren an der wurzel packen und bek mpfen
3305830 jetzt geht es darum die expertise der sterreichischen nationalbank im bereich der geldmarktstabilisierung einzubinden und in einer gemeinsamen kraftanstrengung alle ma nahmen zu setzen wettbewerb beleben inflation bek mpfen so lautet unser gemeinsames ziel

3305838 not been able to convince the principal stakeholders in the housing market that their proposals as they now stand are sensible or worthwhile or are likely to be effective for their declared purposes
3305839 what tends to happen is that a person who has been injured goes to a lawyer who does a vast amount of research often unnecessarily in our opinion before putting the claim anywhere near the insurer there is then a process of negotiation over liability and settlement in a very adversarial system
3305840 the guy who has been injured is kind of encouraged to stay off work doesnt get back to work so quickly possibly ends up on incapacity benefit and the whole system fails him
3305841 it would be wrong to say this was the fault of the computer system as it works in the states the problem is with getting people to adjust to a different way of working along with some technical issues other trusts will need to learn from this
3305842 the latest revelations from barts show that this is not just a story about it these failures directly threaten the standard of care offered to patients in this case patients with suspected cancer it is hard to imagine a more serious failure

3305879 as a fitness professional i think this site is exactly what is needed to promote ourselves and our clubs without asking our members to join social networks that can be unsafe or inappropriate i think many of my students and staff will use this site to connect

3305935 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
3305936 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
3305937 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

3305939 our members have serious concerns about the quality and reliability of marking and many have still not had their papers returned understandably they feel very let down by the whole process the publication of national figures in these circumstances reinforces their belief that the current assessment system needs to change
3305940 the advice from the independent national statistician is that there was more than sufficient data to produce reliable provisional national results and from the independent regulator ofqual that there is no evidence of widespread problems with the quality of marks to withhold publication they are in the best position to judge these decisions

3305946 how else could you read the letter but as saying its my fault i was raped
3305947 cicas policy is not to make a reduction on a claim for compensation following rape on the basis of alcohol consumption the scheme was originally applied wrongly in this case but this was corrected at review and the award was paid in full

3305962 i thought they were very generous to the chinese lad
3305963 you expect a slight bias but you come to the olympic games and you also expect a level playing field
3305964 he is strong and i think hes better than me
3305965 he had to pick one or the other he picked the chinese kid but because it was in his own backyard he took two points off me as well
3305966 i got caught off balance and he hit my arm and he got the point
3305967 ive watched the scoring the first few days and i knew what would happen we were told before we went in the ring that if we ran around wed get a warning but i never heard the referee tell him about it once

3305969 joe didnt box the best ive seen him but scoring makes a difference in the tactics youve got a game plan when you go in if that changes you have to box differently and i think joe had a game plan that was working the scoring was absolutely stupid and that changed it
3305970 joes a very talented lad and did very well in the world championships but that was on a level playing field here every time he landed they pressed the button for the chinese lad
3305971 im not grouching at all but you saw for yourself yesterday the ukraine team lodged a protest against the chinese scoring and im not going to do that its sour grapes
3305972 they always pass these authorizations with a lot of fanfare as if they are going to spend the money immediately but a lot of these bond bills are over five or ten years
3305973 there is the issue of giving false expectations that theyll be spent in the near term
3305974 you just cant keep spending and borrowing at that rate and expect that taxpayers are going to continue to pay higher taxes
3305975 borrowing so much that hes going to turn around and ask for a very large tax increase
3305976 the bonding is based very much on an affordability analysis

3306006 i said if i could do anything id open up a motorcycle dealership and she said why dont you do it
3306007 one of the only things that i had in my business plan that could truly be catastrophic failure was that if i was unable to get motorcycles from triumph being a one dealer line and thats what happened
3306008 fortunately we heard about that fire early so i literally called up my triumph rep and placed an order of 30 motorcycles and they fulfilled that order which helped carry me through
3306009 having the multiple lines makes us a stronger dealership which is better for our customers as well
3306010 they are super light and small which allows smaller customers particularly women to have a true starter bike that theyll use for a year or two and then grow out of it
3306011 picked up the schwinn line and subsequently the vespa piaggio line
3306012 this is our third season with vespa piaggio and we are literally just about sold out of everything we can get our hands on
3306013 very concerned about style because they get top quality and style with the vespas
3306014 if i was not on route 1 i was not going to be successful because we had dealerships north and south of us
3306015 we endeavor to build the best service team in the northeast and im fairly confident were most of the way there if not all the way there
3306016 this is where we were meant to be all along
3306017 when we get out and out thunderstorms that keeps people home
3306018 i think it does help that portsmouth is very walkable
3306019 this is one of the last tourist cabins on the beach
3306020 its a unique part of 20th century hampton history thats worth preserving
3306021 this was absolutely typical of what was at the beach from 1920 and into 1950s
3306022 we tried to make the cabin as it would have been like in the 1950s
3306023 we also have an old coke bottle opener that was used back then
3306024 as we go along we would like to keep adding things to the cabin
3306025 this one has kind of a funny feel about it
3306026 it leaves a bad taste in your mouth it was unnecessary were a small knit group the fact that this was a brand new policy and we werent as aware of it as we should have been they should have had a rules meeting to make us more aware
3306027 we all went around the table a couple of times and said what we thought it ended with us not agreeing with it
3306028 all i was thinking about was that one stroke penalty and it could affect the outcome of the tournament that putt seemed to turn my focus a little bit
3306029 sometimes when you get down in golf its very difficult to rebound
3306030 and megan on the other hand while i was losing my focus she was gaining more focus
3306031 i wish wed been able to play 54 holes its kind of a bummer
3306032 i want to spend time with the board of selectmen the community get a feel for the priority issues
3306033 i want to do some listening and learning to start with
3306034 to facilitate the town work with elected officials starting with the board of selectmen staff and citizen groups
3306035 its just to facilitate the work of the town and to manage its resources
3306036 once i drove back a 56 ford victoria brought it home reworked it its in new jersey now
3306037 that was the house where the window got broken working with greenland and north hampton police we were able to tie the driver and passenger to the abenaqui and the theft of wiring
3306038 im totally surprised its not often a 45 year old can win a race
3306039 its a beautiful town on a beautiful day and the crowds were great
3306040 it was great day it was nice to run in the sun and not the rain
3306041 i definitely had to push because iworsky is good and you knew you had pressure behind you
3306042 i took it out hard because i saw a bunch of high school kids cross country kids
3306043 so i thought theyd take it out hard but they must have been on break or something because i found myself alone behind the police cruiser
3306044 the first part of the race went great i was right where i wanted to be at 5 52 for the first mile and then i just started slowing down i dont know what happened
3306045 it could be because im training for a triathlon next weekend and ive been spending more time on the bike and less time on the road and my legs felt it mastin was getting closer and if it wouldve been another mile he probably wouldve taken me
3306046 it wasnt my fastest time but it was a good time and ill take it
3306047 at the third mile i figured if i can still run go for it and i never looked back
3306048 i dont get too competitive in that respect i just try to run and hold on and do the best i can do
3306049 its a good course with some flat spots that lets you push a little bit
3306050 we hope to have a scoreboard at knowles field for baseball soccer and if we add it flag football
3306051 we want to make sure the kids want to play
3306052 two inches of rain is expected to fall before wednesday morning
3306053 thunderstorms are also expected and the ghastly conditions are likely to last until the end of the week
3306054 excess speed is one of the main causes of collisions and this sends a strong message that the criminal justice system and our community safety partners will not tolerate this type of behaviour
3306055 it is a jihad because this individual should not be given the chance to destroy the countrys political stability and prosperity
3306056 if we allow him to lead the country he would lead us to destruction
3306057 some very serious questions to answer on his return to australia
3306058 mr rudd must tell west australians whether the 134 000 job losses will occur in this state and if so where and in which parts of the economy and in which businesses she said
3306059 he has to answer why there was a 2 billion tax hike on gas condensate a 2 billion tax hike on the north west shelf which we believe will be passed onto domestic gas users in this state
3306060 and he must also answer why he has done nothing to reduce grocery or oil prices as he promised to do at the last election
3306061 mr rudd does have history of a relationship with brian burke that he tried to avoid in the lead up to the federal election ms bishop said
3306062 all those issues of his dealings with brian burke and how honest he was with the australian people about his relations with brian burke will be the focus of his visit here
3306063 weve already had five ministers resign since the last election how many more would be resigning if wed heard from the ccc on this governments shady dealings ms bishop said
3306064 there was a little boy who was three years old and a small girl who was about one and a half a police spokesman said
3306065 its an absolute tragedy any loss of life is particularly children can devastate a small community
3306066 the report highlights the differences between prices paid by australian consumers and consumers in other countries when roaming overseas to a range of popular business and tourist destinations
3306067 the mobile telecommunications industry is understandably very concerned that a very limited analysis of this kind must be read with a full understanding and clear disclosure of the constraints of its information sources and the conclusions heavily qualified to avoid a totally misleading impression of the actual situation
3306068 unfortunately jet lag is not the only thing that knocks over australians when they return from abroad they can also be floored by their mobile phone bills
3306069 we are now waiting for him to wake up and speak so we can find out more details about what happened
3306070 it presents several new aspects which were not present in previous incidents in xinjiang
3306071 one is the sophisticated coordination of the attacks it was not just one attack its a string of bombings that requires much more planning and a larger organization to carry out especially at the time of the olympics when the security is so high
3306072 if you look at the streets everything seems calm and peaceful
3306073 but behind it all the situation is different people are really angry
3306074 if you are a muslim you are already a criminal suspect in the eyes of the chinese
3306075 australias future will also depend on our ability to engage constructively and effectively with the countries of the asia pacific
3306076 that is why i am committed to making australia the most asia literate country in the collective west
3306077 by investing in asian languages and cultural education in australias schools my vision is for the next generation of australians businessmen and women economists accountants lawyers architects artists film makers and performers to develop language skills which open their region to them
3306078 originally posted by gj pain act russian russians have huge cock
3306079 we havent had time to do anything outside of practice games scouting its been videos every day meetings every day the last time we came we had free time to see tiananmen square the great wall this time around no
3306080 i think that hurt her chances but there wasnt much she could do about that
3306081 you have the opportunity to see new places and do new things you work with other great coaches you can learn from and i always bring back some great things when i come home at duke and now at texas
3306082 yes theyre just moving along without me theyre pretty self sufficient
3306083 i miss everyone there but it looks like everyone has been able to move on
3306084 it will always be home to me and my family
3306085 jerome paid for his lack of physical freshness which is linked to his struggle to lose weight
3306086 age was also a factor its easier to lose weight when youre 20 than 29 he just lacked that little energy and power because he wasnt fresh enough because of his weight problems
3306087 i knew they were going to give him everything he wanted
3306088 ive been watching the scoring here the first four days and i knew it was bad so i was expecting it
3306089 you expect a slight bias for the home team but you come to the olympic games and expect a level playing field joe didnt box the best ive seen him but the scoring makes a difference and the tactics had to be changed because of the scoring everything the chinese guy touched they pressed the button for him
3306090 i just cant wait for london i just wish it wasnt four years away
3306091 i am very proud even to have got here everyone said i beat the odds
3306092 i am really hungry for it now i want to prove that china can do it and not just in the sports that it is traditionally good at
3306093 everyone in the eventing community has been so supportive they are all telling me to keep my head up
3306094 jerome paid for his lack of physical freshness which is linked to his struggle to lose weight
3306095 age was also a factor its easier to lose weight when youre 20 than 29 he just lacked that little energy and power because he wasnt fresh enough because of his weight problems
3306096 i knew they were going to give him everything he wanted
3306097 ive been watching the scoring here the first four days and i knew it was bad so i was expecting it
3306098 i dont think shes as strong as the kazakh woman but taiwan is a part of china so if she wins gold that also counts as ours
3306099 we could not get the necessary guarantees from these two countries so we found an option in turkey
3306100 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3306101 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3306102 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3306103 fake singing is bad to make a lip synch is worse
3306104 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3306105 he saw this picture and obviously for him it was very easy recognising the girl accompanied by a woman in a veil
3306106 its her nanny she is a young moroccan woman who is qualified to look after children and works in a care centre
3306107 i am very pleased that this little girl has been identified and that she can be ruled out from her familys perspective
3306108 i think it is due to the weather conditions the hot humid weather and rain i think from today there will be more spectators in the stadiums the tickets are sold out thats correct
3306109 many scalpers came to me but i couldnt afford the price for that price id rather stay at home and watch tv
3306110 from the tv broadcasts we can see lots of seats are empty
3306111 we cant afford that and people like us who really want to see the games cant get in
3306112 mrs toguchi prayers are nice and its probably very helpful but you still need chemotherapy
3306113 dear lord youre the one who created my body so i know you can fix it
3306114 i put my whole faith in you father damien please pray for me too because i need your help
3306115 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3306116 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3306117 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3306118 i think it is due to the weather conditions the hot humid weather and rain i think from today there will be more spectators in the stadiums the tickets are sold out thats correct
3306119 many scalpers came to me but i couldnt afford the price for that price id rather stay at home and watch tv
3306120 from the tv broadcasts we can see lots of seats are empty
3306121 we cant afford that and people like us who really want to see the games cant get in
3306122 no i dont know im not going to tell you
3306123 his book is the only book on hitting i have in my house
3306124 lets go to robot master ive got some items i need to get
3306125 you can take your time to assemble the other box its yours too
3306126 then hitler annexed the sudetenland under the pretext of defending ethic germans as a prelude to gobbling up czechoslovakia
3306127 then the worlds foremost free nations tut tutted about the sudetenland but handed it to hitler on a platter anyway now the leader of the free world wags his finger catatonically in beijing and vladolf having already made his getaway thumbs his nose
3306128 putler is clearly the one calling the shots in russia notwithstanding his recent demotion to prime minister from president
3306129 see the pub at the end marked mm thats a mongrel mob drinking hole give it a wide berth and the other pub just over the roundabout marked bp thats where the black power drink give it a miss too as for queen street that runs between the two pubs hold tight to your bags and walk in pairs
3306130 no i dont know im not going to tell you
3306131 his book is the only book on hitting i have in my house
3306132 after four years and many nightmares i have white hair
3306133 all these years there was only one gold medal for us in team final in sydney in athens we wanted to have some result unfortunately we fell
3306134 this gold medal is good recognition of six persons efforts each had to do his utmost
3306135 no i was not scared going last on high bar because all my big brothers had a big performance
3306136 i really relaxed did my routine and felt no pressure
3306137 id love to have more people here from day one
3306138 the understanding is we have to do something about this
3306139 this is unacceptable to us and to the sponsors so again we are being promised that something will happen
3306140 from yesterday we saw there were not many people inside the olympic green and so we are going to encourage more people to come over to the olympic green
3306141 up until now people thought that the tasmanian mega fauna had actually gone extinct before people arrived on the island
3306142 things were very climatically stable in that part of australia and yet the mega fauna still managed to go extinct
3306143 so its down to humans of one sort or another
3306144 a lot of people still have in their minds an axe wielding spear wielding people bloodthirsty out there slaughtering all over the place it wasnt like that at all
3306145 it was basically just one joey baby kangaroo in the pot for christmas and thats all youve got to go to do to drive slow breeding species to extinction
3306146 da habe ich viel sch nere zangen der zahn muss definitiv raus sofort
3306147 na klar doch das traue ich mir zu wieso fragen sie
3306148 na beim letzten mal hat mich ihr kollege vorsichtshalber zum kieferchirurgen geschickt aber es ist mir viel lieber wenn sie das gleich machen ich bin nicht ngstlich legen sie ruhig los
3306149 nee jetzt k nnen wir nicht unterbrechen dann kriege ich ihn nicht mehr zu fassen
3306150 im not sour grapes im not lodging an appeal im not saying he won but the judges took it away from him when youre chasing the bout you do things youre not comfortable with
3306151 ive been watching the scoring the past few days and i knew it was bad so i was expecting it
3306152 you saw it for yourselves its not just us lodged an appeal after they lost to a chinese boxer

3306159 das kann ich nicht damit habe ich noch nie etwas zu tun gehabt

3306162 es gibt mehr im leben als den t glichen verkehr zu beobachten und streunende katzen an sich urinieren zu lassen
3306163 der heinzelmann ging vor vielen vielen monaten verloren und ich habe ihn total vergessen
3306164 dann habe ich die t r aufgemacht und gesehen dass er zur ck war welch ein schock
3306165 sie war mit jemandem zusammen der sie nicht gut behandelt hat
3306166 theoretisch kann man auf dieser terrasse leben man hat was man braucht

3306170 letzter versuch der besuch eines der wie schwammerln aus dem boden wachsenden in lokale
3306171 its uncommon to see people dressed up like this so the victims were watching them
3306172 they always pass these authorizations with a lot of fanfare as if they are going to spend the money immediately but a lot of these bond bills are over five or ten years
3306173 there is the issue of giving false expectations that theyll be spent in the near term
3306174 you just cant keep spending and borrowing at that rate and expect that taxpayers are going to continue to pay higher taxes
3306175 borrowing so much that hes going to turn around and ask for a very large tax increase
3306176 the bonding is based very much on an affordability analysis
3306177 our capital plan is not a wish list there are some choices that we made
3306178 we can even speed it up if things get really great or slow it down if we hit a wall
3306179 depending on what happens in 2009 it could be a cause for concern
3306180 your revenues are declining and then youre carrying more debt so they need to be careful
3306181 it has nothing to with real life nothing to do with justice its politics and politicians
3306182 this is more of a kick at the mayor by the governor
3306183 yes i know chicago is chicago and its a big city and mayor daley is the mayor there but im the governor of all of illinois
3306184 when communities are being dominated by gangbangers i think we have a responsibility to be as helpful as we can
3306185 youd have to strip some section of the state bare to provide enough state police to make any sort of impact
3306186 and its not like there are 200 300 sitting around a barracks somewhere waiting to get a call
3306187 if the idea was there is a need for more police theyd hire more chicago police officers
3306188 if not in a literal sense then a figurative sense
3306189 from a policy perspective the question becomes do you want to keep these towns active
3306190 if you see an out migration driven by accelerating economic decline which is possible then what you may be having is people staying in these areas just because they dont want to leave and having to piece together work
3306191 at the last three home football games last year there were over 1 000 people
3306192 they told me we succeeded we are the world champions i told them we reached our target
3306193 other teams were good but we were better we performed perfect today everyone was excellent
3306194 it bothers me a lot especially if people from home kind of put down our team saying count the u
3306195 i wish more people in the u s believed in us like we believed in us now i hope more people realize the u s is a force to be reckoned with
3306196 since athens the chinese team has run into a lot of failures which tested the team
3306197 i know them and they do work very hard and put a lot of hard work in their training we worked as team we enjoyed it and thats more important than anything
3306198 we always believed in ourselves and we kept at it tenacious
3306199 and our guys knocked it out of the park it was just amazing
3306200 look you can barely play the instrument we need to work on your form
3306201 alla fine della settimana scorsa sono comparse le stime sul nostro prodotto interno lordo e insieme gli indici che misurano la salute delle imprese italiane il pil allo zero ma le nostre imprese godono di salute strepitosa mostrando profitti che non si registravano da decenni limpresa cresce litalia retrocede mentre c chi accumula profitti mangiare fuori costa il 141 in pi rispetto al 2001 ma i buoni mensa sono fermi da anni

3306203 gee i wonder what its really like where ege lives
3306204 in eritrea cinema theaters are very crowded for local films
3306205 its different than what i remember from last year in that the pollution looked more yellow and dark
3306206 its whiter this year i think its a combination of a different time of year and little bit more mist and humidity in the air so it doesnt look as bad but you can still kind of taste it
3306207 there is a reinforcement on the other side and its not by chance that we are training intensively on the golan heights and on a major scale
3306208 there has been a very significant reinforcement of hezbollah in recent years and we are examining the possibility that the balance of power has shifted with the introduction of sophisticated weapons from syria
3306209 we will advise on the issues as we move forward
3306210 auspicious development that has paved the way for full scale negotiations raising the prospect for an all inclusive government
3306211 it is regrettable that our detractors continue to impose more sanctions
3306212 we therefore call on britain and its allies to remove sanctions to enable us to freely chart our destinies
3306213 i believe these massive crimes in darfur cannot be committed without political support so if the african leaders are clear about the crimes they will be very important in stopping the crimes
3306214 at the end of the day the victims are african women who are being raped and killed in the camps the victims are african children exposed to conditions that mean they will die
3306215 i think we have to keep explaining to african leaders the case what we are doing and then they can fulfil their own responsibilities
3306216 i believe we have a common goal to stop the crimes
3306217 the other cases in africa we are working there because the presidents of the countries referred the cases to me
3306218 i understand its a very complicated situation for other african states
3306219 of course arresting individuals like ugandan rebel leader joseph kony protected by militias of individuals like haroun protected by the states is probably the most difficult challenge

3306237 it is very disappointing data with widespread signs of higher price pressures
3306238 it will undoubtedly convince some members of the monetary policy committee to vote for higher rates but we doubt they will reach a majority
3306239 the report highlights the differences between prices paid by australian consumers and consumers in other countries when roaming overseas to a range of popular business and tourist destinations

3306267 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3306268 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3306269 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3306270 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3306271 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3306272 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3306273 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3306274 the audience will understand that its in the national interest

3306279 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3306280 the west is supporting one palestinian faction over the other its all about politics not human rights
3306281 we have warned of the west bank government turning into a security regime and there are indications that we are heading in that direction
3306282 as we all know hamas is not only working in gaza
3306283 it works in the west bank too therefore i cannot act as if nothing has happened

3306289 die wohlhabenden haben schon fr her hinter der stadtmauer gelebt
3306290 gr nwald ist out die reichen haben seit einigen jahren das zentrum als ort f r luxuri ses wohnen entdeckt
3306291 vor allem bei russen und lscheichs hat es einen riesigen zuwachs gegeben

3306294 there is nobody on the board with a marketing or advertising background nobody with experience of working at somewhere like procter amp gamble for example
3306295 i have suggested in the book that there were different ways of handling the stadium naming rights
3306296 they could have been protected the brand by calling the stadium something like the highbury emirates
3306297 but let us not forget it is the third richest football club in the world
3306298 we suspect that this is revenge tehrik e taliban and al qaeda theyre all under attack we suspect this blast has been done by tehrik e taliban to take revenge for our activities
3306299 we are hitting their hideouts so naturally they are responding
3306300 there is no way to confirm it because the site is not accessible it is in control of the taliban
3306301 what is the white house going to be the pink house
3306302 that was the house where the window got broken working with greenland and north hampton police we were able to tie the driver and passenger to the abenaqui and the theft of wiring

3306308 this will be its first public appearance i saw copies for the first time today with any luck it will be available within a couple days
3306309 earmark has become a pejorative word but what it means is that i go to my colleagues in congress and convince them that unh has the talent and ability to monitor airborne pollutants and needs this money
3306310 it gives us the essence of getting into what we need to know to make intelligent decisions about the environment
3306311 this facility sets us up as an international leader in air quality monitoring
3306312 it gives us the ability to understand the impact of air quality on this region
3306313 despite the notice were still working diligently to reorganize and restructure to get out of our financial predicament
3306314 there are a few different groups of investors were talking to to get to the bank before sept 12
3306315 we did have the fund raiser that helped buy us some time
3306316 we have music in august and some planned in september but if things go well well have an announcement that things will go on the scope of what needs to happen is beyond a few better nights of business its about restructuring
3306317 now people are thinking about the cost of taking an hour drive and paying 25 for a ticket bands are having a hard time traveling and real estate values went down although we had to bring in the capital for improvements
3306318 were looking at things like changes in the business where we might be in the minority role half of the building isnt even being utilized and we can bring in improvements maybe create a function room or a place for artist space rehearsal rooms expand the restaurant hopefully therell be some people with financial backing to make the building fully utilized
3306319 friends and neighbors came to witness them getting off the trailers they ran off into the meadow and havent stopped eating since
3306320 were told they like pumpkins but well need to wait and see about that
3306321 they are lower in cholesterol and fat than chicken its red meat without the guilt of red meat there are tremendous health benefits and ease of care they are not domesticated so they take care of themselves

3306329 when we get out and out thunderstorms that keeps people home
3306330 i think it does help that portsmouth is very walkable
3306331 if you do not register your dog within a certain period of time you receive a court summons in the mail
3306332 i have heard protest before but never with the voracity of these protests
3306333 its a very insignificant amount if you do it before the deadline
3306334 but it becomes an increasingly significant amount if you are late
3306335 im not saying it hasnt been done or that other towns dont do it
3306336 but i havent found any statutory path for the board to waive the fees
3306337 its more like a spring pattern than a summer pattern
3306338 this is a very time consuming job and change is a slow process
3306339 thats because we want to make sure the people are involved so we can make good decisions
3306340 this is one of the last tourist cabins on the beach
3306341 its a unique part of 20th century hampton history thats worth preserving
3306342 this was absolutely typical of what was at the beach from 1920 and into 1950s
3306343 we tried to make the cabin as it would have been like in the 1950s
3306344 we also have an old coke bottle opener that was used back then
3306345 as we go along we would like to keep adding things to the cabin
3306346 i think its going to be fun for people to see what it was like staying at hampton beach in the 50s
3306347 the exhaustive search for interpreters did not last for almost a year
3306348 i wouldve kept the program going if i had just had the people
3306349 but i figure i should step out of my comfort zone to see what goes on in the art capital of the world
3306350 we will be reaching out to locals in that area in a grassroots way we stress calling and direct outreach
3306351 well be spending a lot of time in the exeter area with door to door efforts calling and encouraging things like letters to the editor
3306352 we want to educate the exeter area about the candidate they should vote for and why
3306353 mccains policy is head and shoulders above candidate barack obama who doesnt have a comprehensive energy plan we need to get away from our dependence on foreign oil and i think mccain has the plan to do that
3306354 senator mccains plan for health care is head and shoulders above a mandated policy like obama has planned
3306355 on your mark get set go let me go let me shoop to the next man in the three piece suit i spend all my dough ray me cutie shoop shoop a doobie like scoobie doobie doo
3306356 you have to get physically out there to your site specific area to see what you have
3306357 its good to be out in the field visualizing this
3306358 fbcs are not about how a street looks but how it functionally and sustainably lives
3306359 a town may make a master plan but what we are doing here is making a regulating plan
3306360 there is often a disconnect between the plan and the zoning regulations
3306361 the mission here with the fbc is to create a public space
3306362 youre encouraging a different type of development do we want stratham to be a big box automobile oriented strip
3306363 a lot of this is here because the zoning ordinances encouraged them to build this that way
3306364 whatever street plan we come up with developers might say thats what im going to do or they might change it
3306365 what we are doing here is laying out land development regulations were providing options its the people who own the land who have to decide if its in their interest
3306366 if the master plan provided the vision and the guiding light
3306367 this process provides the regulatory process the way to make it happen this is not all going to happen tomorrow but the plan needs to be in place for the day it does
3306368 its nice to have something like this in the town of newmarket where friends and neighbors can gather and enjoy the rides
3306369 i like being able to learn about fire and rescue techniques and meet people
3306370 its nice the younger kids can learn stuff too from us and thats pretty cool
3306371 all the people come from out of town that were once residents its like a big reunion
3306372 despite the notice were still working diligently to reorganize and restructure to get out of our financial predicament
3306373 there are a few different groups of investors were talking to to get to the bank before september 12

3306380 femas damage assessment found that communities suffered major and costly damage
3306381 im pleased that president bush has moved to issue this disaster declaration to provide financial assistance to communities
3306382 i am disappointed the federal government will not be assisting the many new hampshire families impacted by this severe weather and we will be asking that the decision not to include individual assistance be reviewed
3306383 the state of new hampshire will continue to work closely with local communities and volunteer organizations to help ensure our citizens who were impacted by the storm get the assistance they need
3306384 recent storms have caused significant damage in many communities across new hampshire which is why we are asking fema to begin assessments to determine eligibility for federal assistance
3306385 deputy silver has been working diligently to have hampton acquire this designation from the state of new hampshire and these units play a role in the hopes that this will happen
3306386 by placing these units into the community it should be made clear that they are only part of the first step in an overall community based early intervention program to help combat heart related issues and sudden cardiac arrest within the community
3306387 that says a lot about the quality of life and the quality of service in hampton
3306388 im having to fight to get into my office its getting harder and harder to do business how much longer can businesses survive its becoming a financial hardship
3306389 what did the doctor say how to be a savvy listener for your own well being
3306390 i want to spend time with the board of selectmen the community get a feel for the priority issues
3306391 i want to do some listening and learning to start with
3306392 to facilitate the town work with elected officials starting with the board of selectmen staff and citizen groups
3306393 its just to facilitate the work of the town and to manage its resources
3306394 we want to pay attention to what the master plan is getting at
3306395 i think its all going to come down to traffic management
3306396 you look at the shaws and market basket parking lots even when its busy there is so much empty pavement out there
3306397 it will be the same size as the shaws sign only with a more substantial base
3306398 in this life we cannot do great things we can only do small things with great love
3306399 i think everyone is quite sad that the gallery will be closing
3306400 there are a number of wonderful artists who have participated and shown their work on a regular basis it will be kind of an artistic blow to the seacoast area
3306401 id say it covers pretty much every art form that you can imagine everything from watercolors of local scenes to oils of beautiful nature it also includes abstract art just about every form of art you can imagine but its all done by seacoast artists
3306402 needless to say we are all very disappointed that the shop cant continue because this gallery was such an incredibly beautiful move for us from our previous location below the water street bookstore that space although less expensive was really off the beaten track this is right on water street has a beautiful storefront window and gets a lot of foot traffic
3306403 its just that people are holding onto their money to pay for staples like food fuel and gasoline so art is not as desirable as it seems these days
3306404 its very unique in todays marketplace to have a piece of original artwork our pieces are reasonably priced and offer a variety of artwork
3306405 we are hoping area residents rally around us for the auction we are going to have to make a sad situation a little better
3306406 the space is so awkward it had a lot of wall space and because it is three floors it doesnt really lend itself to a lot of businesses
3306407 we are really sad to close the place we really loved it
3306408 this is one of the last tourist cabins on the beach
3306409 its a unique part of 20th century hampton history thats worth preserving
3306410 this was absolutely typical of what was at the beach from 1920 and into 1950s
3306411 we tried to make the cabin as it would have been like in the 1950s
3306412 we also have an old coke bottle opener that was used back then
3306413 as we go along we would like to keep adding things to the cabin
3306414 were really talking about taking a look with a very different lens
3306415 we hope to have a scoreboard at knowles field for baseball soccer and if we add it flag football
3306416 we want to make sure the kids want to play
3306417 i am running for state senate because i do not like radicalism either to the right or to the left and i have seen the shift in our senate district swing way to the liberal left
3306418 you deserve better than that honest open and transparent inclusive government is my goal and with your help and support we will achieve it
3306419 the goal with the night is to let people know were here and this is what we are up to
3306420 the big goal with the whole program is giving youth alternatives to using substances making better choices
3306421 why kids are making the choices they are such as retail and social access to alcohol why kids are abusing substances we are looking at the bigger picture of whats going on in the community
3306422 once i drove back a 56 ford victoria brought it home reworked it its in new jersey now

3306425 the addition of poco augments our base of business in the semiconductor industry while providing growth opportunities in an array of other high performance markets
3306426 poco builds on our materials science capabilities and adds another consumable product line to our mix
3306427 risks related to securities markets and ownership of our securities
3306428 these studies we have now published were retrospective in nature additionally more recent data with the hemescan test on currently diagnosed patients have demonstrated even greater superiority of the hemescan test relative to traditional testing
3306429 these data will be published soon and we hope it will provide enough clinical evidence to help drive the adoption of the hemescan test as a new standard for the evaluation and management of cll patients
3306430 as a hematopathologist i am acutely aware of the limitations involved in applying traditional methodologies for the analysis of heterogeneous and complex malignancies and then attempting to use this limited information for subsequent patient management combimatrixs hemescan test has demonstrated its superiority to conventional testing methods and has benefited many patients i firmly believe that the suite of oncology tests offered by combimatrix will set a new standard for the analysis and risk stratification of human malignancies this will ultimately allow the most appropriate therapeutic regimens to be provided to patients
3306431 our sponsorship of polymer research and development at the university of notre dame continues to be a success
3306432 the university of notre dame hired dr wang to accelerate the pace of our research and development program we are very fortunate to be able to bring someone of dr wangs caliber into the laboratory and we want to thank the university of notre dame for its foresight and diligence in bringing dr wang to the project more importantly
3306433 the addition of dr wang to the team helps fulfill our goal of accelerating the pace of our product development in 2008

3306442 im missing a lot of my sons early years but i have to do it its a good career opportunity
3306443 im in a place in my adult life when i love my job not everyone can say that its one of those sacrifices you make because you love something
3306444 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3306445 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3306446 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3306447 well have to see how we get on on the friday and if we work through our programme and get the testing done then we can draw some conclusions about what is possible but it isnt like some circuits which i have to learn
3306448 it is great to come back to the uk where i spent two years racing in british f3
3306449 i have read with interest the many comments and considerable garbage written concerning the proposed date problem associated with the gold coast indy event for 2009 and beyond
3306450 the creation of an organization whose primary purpose is to intimidate americans into abandoning their first amendment rights is a sad commentary on what now passes for legitimate debate on the left tom matzzies desire to invade the lives of private citizens i suppose that makes him a political peeping tom is an affront to free speech and an attempt to stymie the freewheeling political debate that has long been the hallmark of our nation with his latest effort matzzie has taken our politics beyond the gutter right into the sewer and i have a feeling accountable america will backfire spectacularly
3306451 these increasingly aggressive tactics have prompted several liberal and democratic leaning groups to disband or curtail their activities

3306461 as kids we could run in one house in the front door and go out the back door with a sweet potato pie the community was a village raising all the kids
3306462 so i thought if the kids could somehow approach their new neighbors
3306463 and let the neighbors know they were actually interested in them the kids and the neighbors could meet one another its all about building community
3306464 when you say hi to people it takes you out of your comfort zone
3306465 running for office its like a flamewar with a forum troll but with an eventual winner
3306466 thats where you put a link somewhere and you say hey go see this cool thing because its really neat
3306467 in less than four hours my server crashed because i was getting 8 to 10 people a second visiting that web page and i was astonished
3306468 i will start it on crutches if i have to because it has to start here pretty soon
3306469 his appeal and the way in which he did it was particularly 21st century so he is on the cutting edge of a different way to raise money for your campaign
3306470 i thought that at the end of the day quality would win
3306471 we would like to think that if something is made well it ought to be able to pay for itself
3306472 you have a 99 percent chance of being a failure if you are an independent film
3306473 all of a sudden all these beekeeping societies started contacting us wanting buy videos and book screenings
3306474 i realized that if beekeepers are a community there are an infinite number of communities any number of films can be marketed to
3306475 we used to say that mediocrity will be punished now the good will be punished you have to be very good or great or you will die
3306476 ive never seen more depressed people in my life than i did in cannes last month
3306477 it will feel like we just survived a medieval plague the carnage and the stench will be overwhelming
3306478 in this darwinian new future there will absolutely be a premium for good films on tv pay per view on demand internet or whatever that large pipe that goes to all of our houses will be called
3306479 ive made this piece of art you can find it between the mentos experiment and the sleeping cat
3306480 when we first drove out here we were told we should organize the three democrats out here and make sure we get all three of them
3306481 but as weve come here weve noticed there are a lot of republicans who want permission to vote for obama and a lot of people who are very upset with the way the countrys going
3306482 the strength of this they know who they are they know what the local issues are they know the local things going on so they can speak to their fellow voters and also in a sense be almost character witnesses for sen obama and build support that way
3306483 i think they read too much into the state turning blue
3306484 what you have is some changing demographics but most of it is just the republican brand name being in the trash can enabling wide awake democrats to take advantage of that and in virginia theyve done that
3306485 weve got people coming in the door as they are today weve got headquarters all over the state folks knocking on doors we dont have enough bumper stickers we cant keep them in stock
3306486 thats a good indicator a good grassroots indicator things look good in virginia
3306487 we usually think of a down ticket effect when we talk about coattails but mark warners advantages over jim gilmore are so huge that we could see the reverse coattails effect where the senate candidate is actually lifting up the presidential nominee on the ballot at the same time

3306501 i think personally from what i have seen and what i have heard and beginning to witness some of the actual security implementation measures i am quite impressed with the level of security in place
3306502 it is another matter to satisfy and improve the confidence of key players
3306503 its upon us to convey the message and to raise confidence based on what we have seen and experienced that the security arrangements in place should be sufficient to have the event safe and secure
3306504 the australians the new zealanders and i have spoken to some of the south africans and the west indians too there are loads of players who have got their reservations

3306507 there is a strong likelihood that karachi and lahore will hold the matches thus excluding rawalpindi as one of the three venues
3306508 it is a very unsettled picture there will be showers throughout the day and heavy thunderstorms
3306509 a group had been out camping and were woken by the rain at around 5am and found their camp washed out

3306514 dananananackroyd have one of the most infuriating names but that shouldnt put you off theyre brilliant

3306527 andy and me are old friends and obviously know each other well from wolves so i am sure he will be happy to help
3306528 tom is young keen and just wants to play football he can do that here and it is great experience for him he played well on saturday and we are delighted with the progress he is making so far
3306529 if we can leave there with another three points and another clean sheet i would be delighted i said to our three central defenders on saturday that if we can stay solid we have a firm base to build on
3306530 with the firepower we have we will score goals so if we can keep clean sheets we will win games

3306532 the mccain camp seems to have gotten some traction by associating obama with two tabloid stars that no one would ever even think would have anything important to say
3306533 mccains team picked two celebrities that middle americans associate as pampered frivolous stars famous for being famous and it is hard to argue otherwise
3306534 even the most stirring speeches are easily forgotten when theyre short on content taking in my opponents performances is a little like watching a big summer blockbuster and an hour in realizing that all the best scenes were in the trailer you saw last fall

3306543 the ultimate goal of our work over the last ten years has been to find an effective therapy for cryopyrin associated periodic syndromes we began by characterizing the unusual clinical features and debilitating impact of caps and then discovered the underlying genetic basis of the disease a major concern was whether a pharmaceutical company would expend the significant resources necessary to develop a treatment for a disease that has been diagnosed in only a few hundred patients in the united states
3306544 these publications highlight that scientists clinicians and industry can collaborate to efficiently yet rigorously develop therapies for rare diseases with significant unmet medical need as a result of this collaboration patients with caps now have an approved treatment available that can help them to effectively manage their disease
3306545 the development process for arcalyst for the treatment of caps highlights regenerons overall approach to drug development to develop drugs targeted at well documented mediators of disease focus clinical development on diseases in which those biologic mediators play a primary underlying role establish clinical proof of concept and then strive to conduct efficient pivotal studies with well validated clinical endpoints
3306546 in this case recognizing that il 1 is an active mediator of inflammatory disease we developed arcalyst to potently inhibit il 1 in the bloodstream before it can bind to its receptors once it was recognized that the genetic mutation associated with caps is associated with il 1 overproduction we rapidly initiated a pilot study to determine the clinical impact of il 1 inhibition with arcalyst based upon the clear cut responses experienced by the caps patients in the pilot study we then developed a validated instrument to assess the severity of caps symptoms over time and introduced that instrument into two randomized placebo controlled pivotal study phases
3306547 the risk aversion to lending to financial institutions is still high and everyone is still very cautious

3306585 we expect a great response from the community and are seeking supporters for this effort
3306586 there will be no significant material and economic progress in muslim communities until the muslim mind is allowed to challenge the status quo of muslim conventions and even their most cherished shibboleths
3306587 i dont believe there are moderate muslims because in islam you have to believe in every teaching as a holy teaching you cannot change you have to accept it the way it is because otherwise simply you are not a muslim
3306588 the koran remains for all muslims not just fundamentalists the uncreated word of god himself it is valid for all times and places its ideas are absolutely true and beyond all criticism to question it is to question the very word of god and hence blasphemous a muslims duty is to believe it and obey its divine commands
3306589 obl has not bastardized his faith as george w keeps telling us rather he is following his faith to the letter

3306615 dass er die demonstration vor den medien gemacht hat um das zu erreichen

3306630 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3306631 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3306632 the advance casts doubts on russias claim that this five day war is just a peacekeeping operation
3306633 this war is all about russia and the message russias sending to the world this is putins announcement that russia is back as a great power
3306634 we have to understand these russian troops didnt materialize out of nowhere
3306635 this is the culmination of putins efforts to pull georgia back within russias sphere and exert control over it
3306636 i am getting a little bit sick and tired of what were seeing a battle of words from left and right
3306637 you have for a final foil to such wanderings not only in the meaning of the words but in their very sound the hearth and the return
3306638 inside every person there is a struggle a battle between two worlds two natures if you will the battle between good and evil wages on in all of us
3306639 can i not even break my bread before i tell you
3306640 it was from my fathers alternate buyer in slarn that person informs me that we have friends onboard who will assist us when the time is right obviously the contact thinks that my father is still alive and some of the message was incomprehensible to me as it relied on his personal knowledge for understanding
3306641 we might understand it if you read it to us
3306642 unless you were privy to my fathers bedroom secrets i would doubt that very much
3306643 the message suggests that all of the royal families may try and take a hand
3306644 three sets of slarn royalty all fighting over the same swords i should have stuck to selling horses i understood the horse trade
3306645 i cannot change the words on the parchment just because you do not like what they say my lord
3306646 he wants me to give up the fight and let gally sorn give the swords to the house of tallis we dont even know which tallis brother she means to give them too in the worst case it could even be maximus
3306647 with respect my lord what your father has ordered is that you take no unnecessary risks he believes that the swords are not worth your life which they are not
3306648 it doesnt say no unnecessary risks in the letter it says take no risks at all
3306649 it also says dont leave the boat at wegnar dont leave the boat at bretin dont go anywhere near gally sorn dont trust anyone but you two the only thing that surprises me is that my dear father doesnt send me instructions as to when to breathe in and out
3306650 fifteen years ago jant we cannot be afraid to act simply because the sorns killed one of us in the past
3306651 i was a child when he died and father still has petric regardless of what happens to me petric has three children and two of them are boys so the family line is safe
3306652 i will not allow gally sorn to give those swords to the house of tallis i would sooner die
3306653 i still cannot believe that any of the triums would dare to attack the boat company
3306654 the worse thing is that we dont know which one of them did it
3306655 i cannot see it being tallis or jenver therefore logically it must be dalk
3306656 gilan dalk attacking anybody is difficult to believe attacking the boat company is ludicrous
3306657 perhaps somebody wanted us to take the steam dragon to the harbour in tallis
3306658 we are transporting goods for gally sorn and anything to do with the sorns is suspicious captain the sorns are supporters of the house of tallis i would remind you
3306659 it is an action much more in keeping with deren sorn than any of the royal families
3306660 there is nothing i would not suspect deren sorn of doing
3306661 we should assume he is behind it the only other conceivable suspect is maximus tallis
3306662 whoever is behind it our orders are clear we shall dock in tallis and not in dalk
3306663 nobody has won anything yet the boat company has not survived for over a thousand years by letting itself be trampled over
3306664 are you sure you are up to going to breakfast
3306665 the captain says i can eat with the passengers until i am recovered if you want me to
3306666 that is a great honour to bestow and i am going to take advantage of it
3306667 think how much it will annoy yan father says he is still incapable of working in the boiler room after daniel had finished with him i need to prove to him and the rest of the crew i am stronger than he is
3306668 i suppose so but if daniel or jalia has to carry you back you can forget getting any more pain relief from me for a few days
3306669 i could almost put our father right out of my mind on a day like this
3306670 sadly for me this is not a morning i can easily put my husband out of my mind
3306671 it wasnt because of what we were doing earlier in the evening was it
3306672 no my sister it was nothing at all to do with you he came home last night in a towering rage apparently he was caught cheating at cards at his club last night or should i say his former club
3306673 i suspect he was as good as usual i have never been able to spot him cheating and you know how intensive our fathers training was
3306674 some woman going under the obvious pseudonym of jalia aldare humiliated him she cheated rather better than tib did and then revealed him cheating in front of all his friends
3306675 she and daniel aldegar are travelling on the steam dragon with me
3306676 how utterly delightful is the aldegar man any good in bed
3306677 he looks as though he might be however we are not on good enough terms to find out as they claim i have some of their possessions and they want them back they will want in vain as the items in question are hidden where they will never think to look
3306678 this is not one of fathers plans is it i wondered why you were angry but if he has hired those two as mercenaries i can see why you would be so upset
3306679 father insists we pay the traders the full agreed value for the swords when we arrive at slarn and after i spent so much effort whittling their numbers down to three
3306680 oh you have not killed hadon have you i always had a soft spot for hadon mallow i imagined he would be very thrusting if you know what i mean
3306681 he is also one of the traders who are missing and i presume he is dead
3306682 and any battle for the throne involving oto tallis will surely take forever as he is such a hopeless drip father is probably working to ensure adequate supplies for tallis over the long term
3306683 if he would only deal with maximus then we could finish this war in days
3306684 maximus is far too volatile i trust you are not in dealings with him
3306685 father will have you whipped daily for months if you were ever to be so foolish
3306686 that would be better than ending up married to tib prentice
3306687 he was the punishment meted out by father when i did not enamour uncle gal
3306688 it is jalia aldare who should be worried today though tib will kill her before the steam dragon leaves if he gets the opportunity
3306689 and you had a very successful night at the card tables
3306690 for the third and final time daniel i had a wonderful time i won a lot of money for us and today i will win even more
3306691 and nobody at all in this town is upset or seeking to have you hung from the nearest tree
3306692 no they are not daniel everybody involved last night applauded my consummate skills and they are all looking forward to our return match tonight are you satisfied now
3306693 i would have thought another two days in bed would have been better for him
3306694 yes but you are just an ill educated farm boy nin is a sailor
3306695 they are obviously made of sterner stuff than you are
3306696 the captain said i could join the passengers for meals if you wanted me
3306697 hala told me you asked why the keeper is called the keeper
3306698 tell me nin i havent heard a thing about it
3306699 its the most valuable object in the whole of wegnar
3306700 if it ever gets stolen all the important people better run to the hills before the ordinary people kill them
3306701 the keeper is so scared of rumours starting that the coin has been stolen that he allows viewings of it every day in the vaults just to prove to the populace that it is still there
3306702 but its only a gold coin with some glowing jewels in it
3306703 it must be easy to steal if ordinary people can get to it everyday
3306704 its the magic totem of the town the ordinary people believe that they are doomed if it ever leaves wegnar they would instantly suspect the rich people of stealing it and lynch them if it vanished
3306705 the coin is protected behind a magic shield that can even kill fairies one of the crew once took a knife in his boot when he went to look at it and the alarms went off as soon as he crossed the stone circle they locked him up for over a week and he missed the steam dragons sailing the captain said the next person who did anything so stupid again would be put over the barrel for sure
3306706 who needs a weapon in your hands when you are facing a bunch of village guards
3306707 the guards are all trained mercenaries and they take the job very seriously no one could steal the five gem coin from the vault no one
3306708 i believe that anyone can go and see it at noon each day
3306709 i have its in the courtyard in the centre of the palace underground in the magic vaults
3306710 what were you doing last night you got back quite some time after me
3306711 i was looking after the horses and donkeys at a field the boat company owns
3306712 well yes at first then don and cara turned up with their horses and so i sorted their horses out too
3306713 you spent most of the night alone with cara and yet you spend the whole morning questioning my behaviour thats it i am going out and i dont want to see you for the rest of the day

3306715 as i spend more time with olga i realize she is much more if not completely russian than romanian and i really have come to enjoy her sweetness both in person and over the internet she has already been pushing me to make more of a commitment but not in a nagging way just as an occasional reminder that this is what she wants when i think about it she is that way with all things she wants she doesnt complain she doesnt nag and once she feels i have made a decision about something she lets it go hmmmm that seems kind of nice and maybe i underestimated it

3306956 acciones de rusia esta semana han generado serias dudas sobre sus intenciones en georgia y la regi n
3306957 estas acciones han da ado sustancialmente la posici n de rusia en el mundo
3306958 esas acciones ponen en riesgo las relaciones de rusia con ee uu y europa
3306959 es hora de que rusia cumpla con su palabra y actuar para poner fin a la crisis
3306960 hay evidencia de que las fuerzas rusas podr an comenzar pronto a bombardear el aeropuerto civil en la capital

3306964 they always pass these authorizations with a lot of fanfare as if they are going to spend the money immediately but a lot of these bond bills are over five or ten years
3306965 there is the issue of giving false expectations that theyll be spent in the near term
3306966 you just cant keep spending and borrowing at that rate and expect that taxpayers are going to continue to pay higher taxes
3306967 borrowing so much that hes going to turn around and ask for a very large tax increase
3306968 the bonding is based very much on an affordability analysis
3306969 our capital plan is not a wish list there are some choices that we made
3306970 we can even speed it up if things get really great or slow it down if we hit a wall

3306974 inflation is impacting on the economy differently in different sectors
3306975 food manufacturing for example is being squeezed leading to severe job losses
3306976 other sectors like oil and energy are printing inflation by hiking prices
3306977 even when their costs are falling they are slow to pass these lower prices to consumers
3306978 motorists can see that there is 7 to 8 pence difference per litre in the price of diesel between petrol stations across the country this is just a rip off
3306979 action must be taken against this profiteering action must also be taken to stop damaging speculation in the oil market
3306980 if action is not taken it is inevitable that wages will have to rise in response to these higher prices
3306981 it is uncommon for a healthy middle aged man to die from pneumonia
3306982 usually there is an underlying factor damage to the immune system of some sort
3306983 the monograph has been unsatisfactory most commonly as literature but often even in the very analytical functions it was designed to perform
3306984 the more the historian learns from the social sciences the more variables he is likely to take account of the more complex his task becomes the result may be that his conclusions become more tenuous and tentative but this is a result to be welcomed the closer the historian comes with whatever aids to the full texture of historical reality the more deeply is he engulfed in a complex web of relationships which he can hope to understand only in a limited and partial way while he may acquire some usable methods from the social sciences i doubt that the new techniques that he may acquire will outweigh the new problems that he will take on his task has not been simplified it has been enlarged his work has not greater certainty but greater range and depth
3306985 formidable criticisms have been written of the familiar distinction between the nomothetic sciences which can make general laws about repeatable events and the ideographic which seek to understand unique and non recurrent events
3306986 unlike the philosopher of history or the philosopher of science the working historian is not nearly so much interested in whether history can after all be logically classed with the natural sciences as he is in how far his mode of procedure is in fact a scientific one or could be changed to resemble it certainly in the broad sense that he operates from a basis in fact aspires to make warrantable assertions and works in a self critical discipline the historian can see that he has something in common with science but if the term science has any special meaning he sees equally important differences since in his work quantification plays so limited a role and since he cannot conduct experiments or strictly speaking make predictions he naturally feels that the difference between his methods and results and those prevailing in most branches of the natural sciences are of central importance
3306987 much of the claimed difference between the disciplines is hardly more than a series of attempts by the authors concerned to appropriate the work they happen to do for the discipline they happen to profess
3306988 the problem of agency is the problem finding a way of accounting for human experience which recognises simultaneously and in equal measure that history and society are made by constant and more or less purposeful individual action and that individual action however purposeful is made by history and society how do we as active subjects make a world of objects which then as it were become subjects making us their objects
3306989 but in the long run even in the more esoteric branches of history it must surely be the case that there will always come a moment when the historian having worked out a solid conceptual basis will need to start counting to record frequencies significant repetitions or percentages
3306990 all the news isnt bad most of it is but not all of it

3307001 the whole team gained a lot of emotion from the mens relay it was probably the most amazing swim ive seen i think it got a lot of us pumped up for the rest of the meet
3307002 maybe it was yesterdays relay that inspired us all who knows
3307003 i think the girls are starting to relax a bit more and have fun and swim more like themselves

3307005 we believe that the repurchase of our shares represents an attractive investment based on current market prices and therefore represents an accretive investment opportunity for both the company and our shareholders
3307006 the strength of our balance sheet enables us to execute this program while still being able to achieve our short and long term growth strategies and build greater shareholder value we believe that this repurchase is an effective use of our capital
3307007 some customers who used our deer fencing asked if we also sold cat fencing it was an interesting idea after a year of development and testing the kitty corral tm system is now available
3307008 i think a lot of cat owners like me feel guilty for not letting their cats enjoy time outdoors outdoor time is healthy it provides an opportunity for exercise and eases stress with a cat fencing enclosure your cat gets all the benefits of outdoor time without the risk of traffic poisons and other outdoor dangers
3307009 the flexible mesh moves with the cats weight making it difficult to climb and to be absolutely certain the cat wont climb out the top of the fence has an inward curving arch
3307010 just like our deer fence our cat fence is virtually invisible against a tree line
3307011 our sales to the semiconductor manufacturing and packaging industries grew 27 over the previous quarter while our revenues from the pcb market declined moderately this is a considerable achievement given the background of on going weakness in the capital equipment industry and the global economic uncertainty we can attribute the growth in sales of semiconductor inspection products to the enhanced competitiveness of our new falcon models as well as to an apparent need for additional inspection for existing production lines to support increased volume of technologically advanced products
3307012 as pleased as we are with our top line our gross margin and bottom line were impacted by a number of factors beyond our control these included increasing freight and raw material costs and the further weakening of the us dollar against the israeli shekel we are implementing tighter control over our expenses while continuing our investment in research and development and decided to raise our selling prices by 5 on average we do not expect this raise to have a significant impact on the market demand for our products
3307013 based on the concerns of a global economic slowdown and their potential effects on our industry we opt to take a conservative approach and estimate revenues in the third quarter of 2008 between 18 and 20 million dollars

3307020 i think anybody will tell you that tooth loss can be upsetting
3307021 it is incumbent upon all of us to explain to patients that even the loss of one tooth can have an impact on how they feel about themselves
3307022 the 31 august is important to us the money will be spent wisely it doesnt turn us into millionaires overnight
3307023 but it does free up a little bit of cash for now and also a little bit of cash for january which is good
3307024 thats where i felt we failed last year when we couldnt top up the squad after a perfect start
3307025 its perfect for us weve been waiting an awful long time for nickys money and its just come to fruition now after eight and a half years of patient waiting and it will be spent wisely
3307026 if youve waited that long for something you make sure you spend it right
3307027 im starting to have a re think a little bit i still think we want a wide left player by the end of august ill definitely know what that position will be
3307028 we have been kicked out of our hotel we have had experience after experience that was negative
3307029 we came out with our passports and found they had given us a six day visa expiring on august 6
3307030 the only thing we can put it down to is tightened security for the olympics which seems to have gone overboard
3307031 since then the forestry department in towns across the country held tree planting ceremonies for me arranged speaking engagements at universities and gave us access to local media
3307032 that would have been very painful and besides after all we had done we felt it was belittling to try to run a race into beijing
3307033 it seemed more honourable to say we have done our bit and stop

3307036 it could be that britons know they will have a chance to see the olympics on their own doorstep in just four years time and they may not have been prepared to travel a long way to the far east for these games
3307037 it may be the same with the soccer world cup with people who were happy to travel to germany for the 2006 championships being not so keen to go to south africa for the 2010 event
3307038 weve been busy but no more busy than we would normally be at this time of the year

3307044 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3307045 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3307046 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3307047 the advance casts doubts on russias claim that this five day war is just a peacekeeping operation
3307048 this war is all about russia and the message russias sending to the world this is putins announcement that russia is back as a great power
3307049 we have to understand these russian troops didnt materialize out of nowhere
3307050 this is the culmination of putins efforts to pull georgia back within russias sphere and exert control over it

3307074 i think some of the players are still trying to bed in
3307075 some of them have settled now but you would expect the likes of paul mullin and jamie clarke to hit it off
3307076 theyre working at it and hopefully it will all come together
3307077 i think we defended better than we did last year but i was disappointed to lose the goal
3307078 you always take confidence from scoring goals and weve worked particularly hard over the last 10 days or so on our finishing and getting into the right areas so we hope we can put that into practice in a match situation
3307079 that was the purpose for besart to go and get games so that when he comes back to us he comes back fully fit and raring to go
3307080 the lad had been out for a year with a career threatening injury
3307081 i spoke to him and said you need to get games and the way it is with paterson blake eagles it was going to be difficult for him to start just now
3307082 but theres no doubt hes a player with capabilities and if he can get an extended run in that rosenborg team then he comes back to us on january 1 fully fit and ready to have an impact
3307083 it was dual purpose one it helps besart get that fitness and two it helps us at the football club that he comes back with a part to play
3307084 he could have sat here and played the reserve games but i dont think he would have got to the level that he will playing at rosenborg
3307085 im absolutely delighted for him and really delighted for us because if he continues to get those games he comes back and its served the purpose that rosenborg have given him those games to get fully fit
3307086 selling him hasnt even been discussed its a view to getting him fit so hes got a role to play when he comes back in january
3307087 the way cross border loans work you cant recall a player but he needs those games anyway
3307088 its great that hes scored on his debut but hes going to need an extended run of games and to play for a few months because hes missed a year exactly thats a long time out so therell be rustiness
3307089 hes obviously got a boost from the fact hes going to be playing and starting games and thats given him a great lift i hope that continues and the biggest thing for us is whether he scores or not that he gets that fitness
3307090 their season runs until the end of november but because of the uefa cup it will run to the middle of december at which point he comes back and hes ready to play his part
3307091 because hed been out for a year nobody really knew besart in england but the reason hes at rosenborg is its his former coach whos in charge
3307092 rosenborg to an extent have taken a chance after a year out with a cruciate but the coach knew him and that spoke volumes for him he had a medical and theyve seen that hes okay but any other coach might have been a bit sceptical not knowing the lad
3307093 his coach had known him from his time in denmark and that helped
3307094 we know hes got ability he just needs to get games
3307095 the norwegian leagues a decent league and that was the purpose for it
3307096 if youd put him on loan to a lesser league it wouldnt have served a purpose it would have been the same as him playing reserve games with all due respect
3307097 he had to go to a decent level where he felt comfortable and that was important as well it wasnt just a case of shoving him out hes working with a guy he trusted so he felt comfortable in that environment knowing he has three or four months to do that
3307098 hes desperate to do well hes a great lad weve all got a lot of time for him and a high opinion of him
3307099 he just needs to get games consistently get 90 minutes under his belt and keep that going
3307100 the level is really hard and you have to work and fight really hard to get the chance to win in norway its a really good league
3307101 my second goal was a little lucky but you have to have luck in football

3307112 burnley have spent heavily over the summer and it will be a good test for us to see where we are at

3307138 i came here tonight to tell you alot of things but when bernarda said that you had gone out with jimmy not with other friends i started to worry and decided to stay here
3307139 i left the job phil so i have left the girl as well i know it was a very dumb move but i needed to prove to you that i can do this family thing with you and i want you to be my family again
3307140 we are hoping to finish tomorrow today the credibility of arthur mutambaras role in the power sharing talks is being questioned as the leader of the second mdc faction taking part in the talks appears to be aligning himself closely with robert mugabe
3307141 we appreciate the moral diplomatic and material support our democratic forces and organizations have received from western institutions and governments
3307142 we take exception to the irritating ignorance political insensitivity double standards and patronizing arrogance that characterize western diplomacy
3307143 undermined our legitimacy strengthened our opponents removed our moral authority and ruined our effectiveness and standing among africans
3307144 at a time when zimbabweans are fighting daily for their survival the penchant of the government to allow themselves to eat the wildlife is reprehensible i think back to the days of a young zimbabwe and how the country revelled in its national natural resources including the wild life sanctuaries how is it that the government can make a decision to feed itself and its followers with the very attractions to the tourists i have tried to show that resource in the header graphic of this page and perhaps the animation that i have achieved is an omen of the attitude of mugabes government every district will get an elephant and a buffalo and the meat would be shared among the eight districts
3307145 todays commemoration occurs against the backdrop of a new dispensation
3307146 there was a time id feel like raising my fist
3307147 all of us would lose patience but wed say why lose patience when the facilitor remains calm he said in praise of mbeki
3307148 well of course he is going to praise mbeki because the man is not unbiased is not interested in mediating but more interested in the continued empowerment of mugabe let people chide me for those words but it the cap fits wear it long live president mbeki
3307149 i beg your pardon the rhodesian bush war was against the british how bad is the research done by this reporter the british had nothing to do with the bush war apart from criticising it from afar after a fight the family sits down thats where we are
3307150 its not a sin to defend ourselves protecting our legacy
3307151 the talks cannot go on for ever the mdc has made it known to thabo mbeki that they are not happy with the time it has taken to resolve the crisis
3307152 i come back to my previous statement above mugabe is playing for time time is his friend the longer that he can drag things out the more prepared he is to go to war against the people add that to the fact that mugabe is operating a re appointed cabinet against the will of the people and you see his true colours without really looking too deep at all this is why you see zanu pf saying the issue of mugabes position is none negotiable everything happening at the talks is about mugabes survival and not about resolving the crisis this is why it has taken this long for the two sides to agree on the way forward

3307156 the others are july january september april november may march june december august and february
3307157 october this is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks
3307158 they always pass these authorizations with a lot of fanfare as if they are going to spend the money immediately but a lot of these bond bills are over five or ten years
3307159 there is the issue of giving false expectations that theyll be spent in the near term
3307160 you just cant keep spending and borrowing at that rate and expect that taxpayers are going to continue to pay higher taxes
3307161 borrowing so much that hes going to turn around and ask for a very large tax increase
3307162 the bonding is based very much on an affordability analysis
3307163 our capital plan is not a wish list there are some choices that we made
3307164 we can even speed it up if things get really great or slow it down if we hit a wall
3307165 the time to look is during the dark hours before dawn on tuesday august 12th
3307166 is it possible for us to witness a world without america and zionism
3307167 in the war on terrorism intelligence has replaced the cold wars tanks and fighter planes as the primary weapon against an unseen enemy
3307168 could inflict far more damage to national security than soviet spies
3307169 stop the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace
3307170 we can hardly agree with this because it would assume the presence of people described as georgian peacekeepers
3307171 they can no longer remain they brought shame upon themselves as peacekeepers they committed crimes
3307172 our troops are making advances we are hoping for success
3307173 the new plan is to release a new shirt every other monday
3307174 oh but mccain is worse because he supports the war in iraq
3307175 i guess the million lives lost in iraq are worth less than the million unborn dead
3307176 good catholics only give the mother a chance at survival if they can concoct some dual effect situation which tends to be needlessly complicated and dangerous
3307177 congressional research service reported that the bill would amend about 15 000 provisions of the u s code and 57 000 provisions of the code of federal regulations
3307178 and btw i actually agree with the basic premise of mms post
3307179 made themselves into the kind of people who support a deliberate murderer a moral monster
3307180 in several cases courts applying the common law have found a single cry insufficient to prove live birth beyond a reasonable doubt because the baby may breathe during the birth process before completed delivery
3307181 the right to life comes first it precedes and undergirds every other social issue or group of issues this is why blessed john xxiii listed it as the first human right in his great encyclical on world peace pacem in terris and as the u s bishops stressed in their 1998 pastoral letter living the gospel of life the right to life is the foundation of every other right
3307182 i have friends in the military too in addition to military targets they are told to target civilians this in undeniable
3307183 the murder of iraqi children is not equal in gravity to the murder of american children in the womb
3307184 i think it is outrageous that people give him a pass as they gave george w bush a pass
3307185 when we really explored it it really came down for him to a sanctity of life question he did get very emotional one time we talked about it he truly believed
3307186 when i went to his d c office i would be put into his waiting room forever and ever and ever and eventually a staff person would come out and put me off and finally i just gave up
3307187 i relive it every time i see the man on tv
3307188 he turned toward me and put his index finger out and started pounding me in the chest saying you know my position on this and how dare you ask me about this and you are just trying to intimidate me
3307189 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good
3307190 there is no immediately available explanation of why anyone at this well known economic think tank should choose to read the blog of a very minor libertarian distinguished only by his complete ignorance of economics
3307191 i am shovelling gravel its too heavy for you you cant do it

3307197 its an amazing gesture it restores your faith in mankind
3307198 i offer you my sincere apologies and my assurances that we are taking all action possible to mitigate the consequences of this regrettable incident
3307199 sie haben nicht gen gend zeit mit ihren familien und so haben sie die m glichkeit zumindest eine woche frei zu nehmen in der sie nicht im b ro oder in den werkst tten sind

3307202 i talked to some folks at sony but they were not interested in carrying the game
3307203 later on i talked to someone from a different division who was interested but by then i had signed with microsoft and started the xbla port
3307204 its a limited exclusive so if i were to try to make a ps3 or wiiware version of the game i would have to wait a little bit
3307205 davinas very keen to take part and wed love to have her
3307206 the woman was very severe with the child she held her hand firmly and kept pulling her closer when i gave the ice cream to the child she stood frozen the lady took it in her place normally a happy child always takes the ice this was not a normal situation
3307207 it was about 13 40 or 13 45 hours the lady had a headscarf and the blonde girl i guess was five the little girl looked healthy but very sad she had her eyes towards the floor and was too shy to look up the lady asked her in a mixture of french and english what she wanted
3307208 the girl answered in english she looked up for only a second with an unhappy face and said chocolate please then she looked down again
3307209 she did seem to have some kind of spot in her eye like a comma i had not seen the pictures of maddie with a spot in her eye at that time i found them a very strange couple
3307210 this has been done in response to the numerous bids for his services
3307211 the resolutions in the provincial assemblies are aimed at exerting moral pressure on president musharraf
3307212 we had fios installed today and im having trouble with the home network i need to turn the firewall on the router off to troubleshoot the problem
3307213 yes thats not the problem i cant connect to our home network and i need to turn off the router firewall to troubleshoot the problem
3307214 i beg to differ im sitting here looking at it i need to know how to turn it off
3307215 so what youre telling me is that your technician came out gave me a piece of hardware that i have to use and now youre telling me you dont support it
3307216 your wait time is approximately five minutes you can continue to hold or i can call you back in five minutes
3307217 i need to take a few days off and spend time with my family i love being part of sports and i guess its difficult to stay away i really cannot bid goodbye to shooting but i seriously need time to think whether i would compete ever
3307218 you have to see the whole thing as a four year journey it was not easy to continue after athens for i had some personal issues but i thank my coaches who stood by me and made me believe i could continue
3307219 last 10 days we were trying to read the targets and i had some difficulty today that also explains the relative low scores in the field today
3307220 when we shoot the first shot the bird is not actually there we only expect it there its anticipation and much like a catch in cricket where you stretch your arm to intercept the ball little hesitation and you are doomed
3307221 i had trouble reading the first target and it affected anticipation as well
3307222 im upset that i could not hold on to my scores i did not shoot very high this year but that should have been enough to qualify for the finals here at the end i have not been able to achieve what we came here for
3307223 and the longer the ladders the less secure they were the first man up would find himself unable to get over others would be mounting behind him and the ladder would break under their weight sometimes the ladders stood the strain but the height made the climbers dizzy and they fell when everywhere ladders were breaking and men falling and success was bringing added keenness and courage to the enemy the recall was sounded
3307224 as i can well understand if i werent who i am caught up now in the service of my country i would probably indulge my desires like other young men but as things are i am going to give this love of yours my blessing under my orders the girl has been kept inviolate worthy of myself and you and she is yours in return i ask only that you become a friend of rome you respected my father and my uncle perhaps now you can feel respect for me i want you to know that there are many men like us in rome and theres nothing wed like better than to be your friend
3307225 it used to be that they were always blamed if they were wearing a short skirt today its that they were drinking
3307226 its very important for women whove been victims of rape to get compensation because often its the only acknowledgement you are going to get that you have been a victim of crime given that the conviction rate in this country is only 6
3307227 with such an international clientele passing through the store during the summer months the opportunity to buy traditional christmas decorations which in many cases differ greatly from those available overseas has been welcomed by our foreign visitors as well as londoners who like to organise themselves well in advance of the big day

3307234 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3307235 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3307236 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3307237 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3307238 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3307239 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3307240 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3307241 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3307242 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3307243 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3307244 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

3307246 to a certain degree i dont know what im getting into
3307247 im here for one reason not to do commercials broadway all those things
3307248 im a little out of shape compared to the other guys
3307249 the last 24 hours have been crazy this offseason has been bizarre but im excited by this opportunity
3307250 i have some of my happiest memories and i also have some of my saddest from those times
3307251 it gives you an interesting perspective being a child of katrina
3307252 we hugged we cried and then we went to english class
3307253 we definitely didnt have the freshman experience we should have
3307254 we went to classes in trailers and ate lunch on the bleachers
3307255 when we first started high school i didnt really want to talk to people
3307256 but after the storm hit i wanted to get involved more and help people out as much as i could
3307257 when football season started in 2005 i felt a lot more spirit as a class weve had to be a lot more creative we were happy just to hang out at someones house or go to the beach or have bonfires
3307258 it was tough but in a way im kind of glad it happened
3307259 i made a lot of new friends and we moved away from the water
3307260 this is an excellent opportunity for you to learn all about the fbi what we do what we investigate and why we do what we do
3307261 fpi gulfport will continue to complete work orders on hand through the course of this year
3307262 the company plans to concentrate on its houston texas operations which are proving to be commercially successful in the u s market
3307263 unfortunately hurricane katrina and its aftermath have made it extremely difficult for our company to consistently deliver on time from the gulfport plant future pipe located its first plant in the u s on the mississippi coast and work force reliability was one of the reasons
3307264 making work force a bigger part of our challenge fpi is committed to work with gulf coast leadership and gov barbour to find a work force solution
3307265 thats why ive been concerned all along about these tax exemptions and discount land prices weve been giving
3307266 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed
3307267 i thought she was going to run under the trailer after i stopped her she admitted she was texting
3307268 if you have a law that has very little teeth its unlikely that the risky behavior is going to change
3307269 we know that teens are very prone to risky behavior
3307270 they have the feeling that they are invincible particularly males they have the greatest propensity to speed and not use seat belts and the highest likelihood of being distracted
3307271 graduated licensing requirements are important because they place limitations on young drivers while theyre still in that extremely vulnerable period of life
3307272 we find it perplexing attorney general hood would claim full credit for a process he opposed from day one and was the foundation for his lawsuit against us which he now has settled
3307273 nonetheless we are pleased the attorney general understands state farm has met its obligations under the agreement made with his office in january 2007
3307274 with this settlement our policyholders have been reassured by mr hood the resolution process has worked well and state farm did the right thing
3307275 i think hes crazy to call a press conference on a lawsuit claiming credit for something he didnt do
3307276 its not historic and im sorry but i cant support this
3307277 i would like to see this building and some others be torn down
3307278 that building has to be cleaned up it has rats and its in horrible condition and its not been taken care of for years
3307279 but some new information has been brought to light and we need to afford him the opportunity to save this building if it can be saved
3307280 the man wants to try to restore it and if he cant he at least wants to demolish it himself so he can salvage some of it
3307281 just in our daily engagement with the population i would think those numbers would have come back higher
3307282 as a dedicated public servant both as a former corrections officer and longtime legislator danny has served his state with honor and strong leadership
3307283 i commend danny on his record of service and look forward to his continued good works as a member of this very important board
3307284 he malone asked me about it and i told him it sure would be nice
3307285 he asked me were you aware of it when you made the contribution i said i really wasnt i mean that is not something you really think about i told him i would do everything i could to help him get it passed
3307286 today we are asking the federal government to release all correspondence that ive had with every government agency
3307287 none of the returned u s prisoners of war released by vietnam were ever interrogated by the soviets
3307288 thats the signal people were waiting for things havefallen so low that we are about 50 percent cheaper thanbrazilian equity any blue chip right now is in huge demand even the oil stocks
3307289 they unions are discussing with the employees they have said they will have an open mind on it
3307290 let us first come to that when we will come to the bridge we will cross it
3307291 it might be that we keep or divest or enter into joint ventures or collaboration
3307292 for the time being there are no plans to divest
3307293 they unions are discussing with the employees they have said they willhave an open mind on it
3307294 let us firstcome to that when we will come to the bridge we will crossit
3307295 inflation is likely to touch the 13 14 per cent mark by october but it may soften after that
3307296 we are in constant touch with the rbi on the rebranding issue
3307297 this large and vital project which is supposed to boostrefining capacity and comply with environmental standards hasbeen subject to interference and contradictory decisions
3307298 take this sinking boat and point it home weve still got time
3307299 go beyond the obvious and make roswell new mexico your brave new destination for fun and intrigue
3307300 learn the truth about our history and see why roswell is the mother of extraterrestrial connections
3307301 there are a lot of tax research studies out there that show evidence that it is a gimmick
3307302 it is generally recognized that there is not a lot of savings to the customer
3307303 i would think living in a computer generation we should be able to make that happen pretty easily
3307304 of course it encourages people to come in and shop and they dont just buy school supplies they say i am saving money here and i can buy more here
3307305 they buy electronics or whatever that is not on the set list
3307306 im happy to help a fellow republican whenever i can
3307307 scott walker has always supported me so im supporting him
3307308 he grew up in ocean springs and went to school there he knows ocean springs very well
3307309 and im honored that hes serving as a host to this reception
3307310 people who attend casinos can use ocean springs for a place to shop and eat i believe biloxi sees the benefits
3307311 if the two towns work together they can benefit from each other
3307312 people who live here can clearly see what weve accomplished
3307313 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3307314 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3307315 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3307316 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3307317 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3307318 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3307319 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3307320 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3307321 the advance casts doubts on russias claim that this five day war is just a peacekeeping operation
3307322 this war is all about russia and the message russias sending to the world this is putins announcement that russia is back as a great power
3307323 we have to understand these russian troops didnt materialize out of nowhere
3307324 this is the culmination of putins efforts to pull georgia back within russias sphere and exert control over it
3307325 i am getting a little bit sick and tired of what were seeing a battle of words from left and right
3307326 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3307327 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3307328 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3307329 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3307330 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3307331 manchester along with five other major conurbations is now the fastest network in uk

3307337 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3307338 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3307339 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3307340 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3307341 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3307342 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3307343 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3307344 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3307345 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3307346 people arent watching the olympics anymore you need to bring younger viewers back if you want to keep making money to do that you need to embrace non traditional sports
3307347 while most sports focus on physical prowess few recognise mental agility this is where video games can bridge the gap the gaming community is populated by some of the most competitive and motivated individuals willing to invest heavily in training and the top of the range products in order to become the best of the best
3307348 the only reason they havent done an exhibition sport in the past several years is no one has brought a good one to them
3307349 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3307350 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3307351 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3307352 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3307353 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3307354 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3307355 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3307356 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3307357 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3307358 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3307359 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3307360 sobre la base de su informe he tomado la decisi n de poner fin a la operaci n para forzar a las autoridades georgianas a la paz
3307361 i am quite impressed by the level and the extent of security that has been in place i think it is still another matter for us to be able to convey it to the full task team
3307362 that would be a challenge because we have personally come to do this visit and it will be upon us to convey that message and raise the confidence of the players that from what we have seen and experienced is the security measures that are in place should be sufficient to have an event that will be safe and secure
3307363 why not finally fucking go there why am i fucking wasting my time and letting the days pass me by when finally i should make a fucking move
3307364 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3307365 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3307366 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3307367 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3307368 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3307369 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3307370 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3307371 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3307372 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3307373 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3307374 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3307375 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3307376 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3307377 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3307378 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3307379 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3307380 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3307381 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3307382 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3307383 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3307384 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3307385 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3307386 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3307387 this brave woman has tried to hang onto her bag but the offender has simply overpowered her and taken it leaving her injured on the pavement
3307388 the east west energy corridor and turkey being an energy hub for the west is one of the principal arguments of turkey in its application for the eu and the need to have a good relationship with turkey
3307389 this conflict casts a shadow over turkeys foreign policy platform of creating an area of stability
3307390 this conflict could strengthen the argument for the west that if turkey is outside the tent it could create a lot of difficulties for the eu
3307391 so from the eu point of view it would make sense to bring turkey into the tent
3307392 there is also a concern that if turkey is part of the eu you are bringing the eus border to georgia and to the rest of the caucasus which might not go well in continental europe
3307393 we want stability in the region and to see fighting stop as soon as possible there is fire in the neighbours house

3307398 to the best of our knowledge there is no objective scientific evidence on the alleged buoyancy advantage provided by the speedo lzr racer
3307399 ive never worn a faster suit than were about to wear its definitely going to change a lot of records in the record books
3307400 i dont like that they come to the competition with the swimsuits just the day before the competition starts
3307401 i like that there are better suits and we can swim faster because thats good for everyone in my opinion but it hasnt been equal for all the swimmers
3307402 everyone can say its the pool or its the suits but what about the athletes

3307411 beyond pop culture the infantilist ethos also dominates dogmatic judgments of black and white in politics and religion come to displace the nuanced complexities of adult morality while the marks of perpetual childishness are grafted onto adults who indulge in puerility without pleasure and indolence without innocence hence the new consumer penchant for age without dignity dress without formality sex without reproduction work without discipline play without spontaneity acquisition without purpose certainty without doubt life without responsibility and narcissism into old age and unto death without a hint of wisdom or humility in the epoch in which we now live civilization is not an ideal or an aspiration it is a video game

3307413 the law is quite clear clubs pay for any policing inside the ground and on immediately adjacent property under their control on matchday
3307414 any other provision deemed necessary is covered by the state its what people pay their taxes for with the premier league alone contributing more that 700m
3307415 this long established principle applies to all individuals and organisations in the uk from private individuals to shopping centres pubs and major events like the notting hill carnival
3307416 our clubs work well with their local police forces to make sure that the call on their resources is as little as possible
3307417 they have invested heavily in all seater stadia cctv and stewarding as a result the numbers of police required to ensure public safety and therefore the cost has reduced over the past 15 years
3307418 we are always happy to discuss how it might be possible to further reduce costs or indeed how football can help the police tackle youth crime but we fail to see why football fans should pay twice for policing
3307419 the cash we get given to police our various areas across the country thats provided by government thats provided by people through council tax and the provision of that is to provide a policing service to those areas and to those communities
3307420 if we have to take officers away from them to police football we are not able to recover the cost of that that means our normal police budget is being used for that purpose which means we then have to provide a lesser service to the rest of the community
3307421 i hope it will not be the case that i get priced out of a move
3307422 if the club dont want me they know that ive been a faithful servant so in a perfect world being allowed to leave for a reasonable price would happen
3307423 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3307424 i was walking through and 10 minutes after i was there the security guard approached me asked me to step aside made me completely do a turn around while he stared me up and down and then asked me to leave because my outfit was too provocative and peoples husbands was sic looking at me
3307425 they confirmed what our sense was and our belief was in this
3307426 its another example that theres very low value on black lives in this community
3307427 the message i got out of all this is that its ok for police to go and kill in a drug raid
3307428 what kind of world would it be if we didnt have police officers
3307429 listen you cant do that because the five billion creators of this free software will be very angry
3307430 itwire com professionals who work on the basis of billable hours rarely take the time out to write an article for publication unless they have a valid reason for doing so
3307431 the learning curve for linux and freeware is enormous because it involves relearning computing from scratch with software that is not user friendly
3307432 so instead of coming from large reputable companies freeware comes from students underemployed programmers and fly by nighters from distant continents who ask for donations rather than payment who seem to have little idea of what american commercial users want and expect in a professional environment
3307433 windows is typically bundled with the purchase of a new computer buying it that way really only adds about 75 under bulk licenses to computer makers and that is money that cant really be saved by avoiding windows because computers sold without any os or with linux as an alternative are hard to find and dont sell cheaper

3307437 the pigeon characters are a fun way to highlight specific features that follow the redesign of the site such as our new directions service including walking directions
3307438 these are part of our commitment to offering a comprehensive range of journey planning tools and the campaign should raise awareness encourage trial and drive traffic to the site
3307439 positioning multimap as accessible and friendly was important and lbi creating this campaign was key to that
3307440 the pigeon characters make the point that multimaps new functionality is ingenious and powerful whilst still being very easy to use
3307441 we worked with aardman animations because of their unrivalled expertise in creating charming characters with animation we wanted our pigeons to be cute but a bit daft too and we think aardman captured that perfectly we plan to make more of them as new features are launched

3307511 most workers in the private sector dont understand that unless they live in montana and arizona their job is at will

3307513 unless you were fired because you are a member of a protected class under federal law or under another state statute its likely not illegal
3307514 a company is most concerned with off the job behaviors that directly conflict with business interests
3307515 you dont have to disclose lifestyle choices or off the clock activities unless there is a clear link to your ability to perform the job

3307518 the study has a very pro exercise message if you had to pick one thing to make people healthier as they age it would be aerobic exercise
3307519 the health benefits of exercise are greater than we thought
3307520 this research re confirms the clear benefits of regular exercise for older people
3307521 exercise can help older people to stay mobile and independent ensure a healthy heart keep weight and stress levels under control and promote better sleep
3307522 while younger people are barraged with encouragement to lead healthier lifestyles the health needs of older people are often overlooked
3307523 there are people who have not accepted and others who have misinterpreted the original recommendation
3307524 some people continue to believe that only vigorous intensity activity will improve health while others believe that the light activities of their daily lives are sufficient to promote health
3307525 people who are very overweight would have to do an hour of exercise a day just to maintain their weight if they arent going to change their diets
3307526 id rather see healthy habits built into daily life gyms arent a sustainable habit for all
3307527 in the us the quota for visas has been filled up resulting in delayed processing of visas with current efforts focused on 2006 accepted applicants
3307528 many licensed nurses are now underemployed or unemployed as a result of changes of policy in destination countries the current situation of oversupply and quality problems among others
3307529 we cannot tell people not to enroll in nursing but they should choose the reputable program that can deliver quality education they must go to reputable institutions the ones that are accredited because priority is given to those coming from these schools
3307530 we actually thought that this trend would only be good for a decade and as expected it already started to slow down
3307531 the evidence is there there has already been a decreased demand for nurses
3307532 are you so scared that we might not get along
3307533 if were going to try and compete even at premier league level let alone europe we need a decent squad so we need to keep adding quality if we can
3307534 weve lost freddie bouma and we were quite thin on the ground before that that sort of injury can happen at any given minute therefore we need to try and safeguard as much as we can
3307535 what weve done is bring in a recognised right back and a recognised left back to help us we didnt have the right back last year but it wasnt for lack of trying
3307536 weve not finished well still have some players coming in to give us a chance and if were lucky enough to qualify for the group stages of the uefa cup that would take us right up to christmas and well most definitely need the squad
3307537 last season we were exceptionally lucky with injuries eight or nine players played over 30 games and we didnt have big runs in the fa or league cup therefore we were able to concentrate on the league
3307538 i hope it will do as much for olympic sports as ours in 1983 did for cricket
3307539 it is not easy for an indian to win an olympic medal let alone a gold because there is no sporting culture in our country i hope this will make sports a way of life in india
3307540 it is important for india to do better at olympic sport as these are the true measure of a nations sporting depth
3307541 with our depth of talent and expanse of people i firmly believe india can be a world class sporting power
3307542 the joy that the nation feels at my win is humbling
3307543 frankly all the attention is a bit overwhelming i ran away from all the media and official attention yesterday after i had done my bit instead i chose to go to a quiet dinner with some friends
3307544 they were giving him points for everything yet when i was hitting him they werent giving me anything
3307545 but ive been watching the scoring here for the last four days and thought it was bad so i cant say im surprised before the fight we were told wed be given a warning if we ran round the ring yet he spent the whole of that last round running
3307546 the only way i could win it was by not letting him hit me in the end i just had to go for a knockout and thats what i was trying to do he beat me on a bad decision here in china last year but i beat him in the worlds when it mattered
3307547 now let him come and fight me in my own backyard and well find out whos the true winner
3307548 you expect a level playing field at the olympics and we didnt get that here
3307549 joe didnt box particularly well but the scoring dictates what tactics you use and the other guy was given more points than he deserved those scores were stupid and they changed our tactics
3307550 the ukrainians yesterday lodged a protest against the chinese which shows were not the only people who are unhappy

3307566 in dem forschungsprojekt das die deutsche krebshilfe finanziert sollen neue genetische ver nderungen in papill rem schilddr senkrebs nachgewiesen und mit dem auftreten bereits bekannter genetischer ver nderungen in verbindung gebracht werden
3307567 dieses gen ist bei der bertragung von wachstumssignalen in der zelle beteiligt und beeinflusst somit ma geblich die zellteilung und die zelldifferenzierung
3307568 hematologic iron analyte values as an indicator of hepatic hemosiderosis in callitrichidae
3307569 with this test we can easily and safely monitor the iron levels in marmosets and tamarins for early identification of individuals that may be predisposed to develop hemosiderosis an overload of iron in the body despite the low iron diet that has been fine tuned to the unique requirements of these species
3307570 commonly discoveries in animals lead to helping human health but this is an instance in which methodologies developed to detect conditions in humans can help veterinarians provide the same level of care to animals that share similar conditions especially our closely related non human primates
3307571 these snails have an operculum a door that closes the shell
3307572 they can be out of the water for longer than other snails and when fed to fish they are not digested and sometimes come out alive this has a potential to alter the salmon and trout fisheries because they alter the food chain
3307573 in the western u s this species is of special concern largely because of their ability to modify ecosystems
3307574 in our most recent survey we were lucky if we found a few hundred per square meter
3307575 in lake erie they are not very abundant but it is unclear what they are doing 100 feet below the surface
3307576 the first is that any introduction of a nonnative species can cause worse problems than they were expected to cure the second is that these flukes have a multiple host life cycle infecting ducks that are apparently not affected before infecting the snails this might work in the west where the snails are in shallow water but no duck is going to dive 100 feet to get snails
3307577 that means that recreational water users must be very careful moving from one place to another we advise anglers to freeze waders and fishing gear or use formula 409 or something like that to kill the snails
3307578 i have frozen them for 12 hours at a time and about 50 percent of them survive
3307579 j ngste studien haben gezeigt dass 70 prozent aller deutschen in der altersgruppe zwischen 35 und 44 jahren unter einer parodontalerkrankung leiden
3307580 ein deutlich erh htes risiko haben raucher und diabetiker aber auch menschen die unter stress stehen
3307581 welche erbanlagen es allerdings genau sind ist aber noch nicht bekannt
3307582 wir arbeiten in dem verbundprojekt daran die risikofaktoren besser zu erkennen und festzustellen welche faktoren chronische entz ndungen von zahnfleisch oder kiefer f rdern
3307583 das sollte unter anderem zu effektiveren therapien und zu neuen m glichkeiten der diagnostik f hren
3307584 mathematiker der universit t bonn werden am rechner simulieren wie sich bestimmte risikofaktoren etwa eine hohe mechanische kaubelastung auf den verlauf der erkrankung auswirken
3307585 so galt parodontose bis mitte des vergangenen jahrhunderts als ganz normale alterserscheinung erst sp ter erkannte man dass der zahnverlust durch chronische entz ndungen hervorgerufen wird die sich durchaus bek mpfen lassen
3307586 der zahnarzt kann zumindest das problem erkennen und weiterf hrende schritte einleiten
3307587 we have the physical system were taking flow measurements of actual swimmers and were getting more information than anyone has ever had before about swimming and how the swimmer interacts with the water and so far these techniques have contributed to some very significant improvements in the lap times of olympic swimmers
3307588 this project moved the swimming world beyond the observational into scientific fact
3307589 the knowledge gained gave me the foundation for which every technical stroke change in preparation for the beijing olympics was based
3307590 to see how a swimmers motion affects the flow you need to know how much force the swimmer is producing and how that force impacts the water
3307591 swimming research has strived to understand water flow around a swimmer for decades because how a swimmers body moves the surrounding water is everything
3307592 the ability to measure flow and forces in a natural and unimpeded environment hasnt been available until recently and dr weis technology and methods presented usa swimming with a unique opportunity that united states swimmers and coaches could learn a lot from
3307593 how often does a researcher get to do something like this
3307594 its been a journey into a world that someone like me would have never before gotten the privilege to see first hand
3307595 its everyones dream to make a difference and im excited to keep helping the team for as long as they need me
3307596 but the real signal came out with some of the northerly species that are more common in canada and the northern part of the u s their southern range boundaries are actually moving northward as well at a much faster clip
3307597 there are a wide spectrum of changes that are occurring and those changes are occurring in a relatively short amount of time were not talking centuries were talking decades
3307598 new york citizens need to recognize that these changes are occurring
3307599 whether they are good or bad whether they should be addressed whether we should adapt to them whether we should try to mitigate some of this those are questions that really rightfully belong in the political arena
3307600 what you begin to see is a systematic pattern of these species moving northward as we would predict with regional warming

3307638 karena yang demikian itu lebih patut dapat mengekalkan kalian berdua
3307639 anak gadis perawan itu hendaklah dimintai izinnya untuk dikawinkan dan janda itu lebih berhak terhadap dirinya
3307640 tidak ada nikah kecuali dengan wali dan dua orang saksi yang adil
3307641 siapa saja wanita yang nikah tanpa memperoleh izin dari walinya maka nikahnya batal batal batal
3307642 hai ali tiga perkara yang hendaknya jangan ditunda tunda shalat apabila telah datang waktunya jenazah manakala sudah siap penguburannya dan perempuan gadis maupun janda apabila telah datang pinangan laki laki yang sepadan dengannya
3307643 tetapi pada keadaan tertentu ada seorang wali yang melarang pernikahan anak perempuannya dan mendiamkan calon suaminya dengan pendiaman yang membingungkan tanpa kejelasan sebab yang dibolehkan syariat di dalam larangannya dalam keadaan seperti ini seorang perempuan boleh mengangkat perkaranya kepada seorang qadhi hakim jika qadhi menilai sebab yang diajukan untuk melarang pernikahan itu tidak masuk akal dia dapat memerintahkan pernikahannya jika sang wali tetap enggan menikahkan qadhilah yang menikahkan dia dengan orang yang telah meminangnya dan tidak mempedulikan wali nasab pada saat itu
3307644 jika mereka saling berdebat sulthan penguasa muslim adalah wali bagi orang yang tidak mempunyai wali
3307645 dan kawinkanlah orang orang yang sendirian di antara kamu dan orang orang yang layak berkawin dari hamba hamba sahayamu yang laki laki maupun hamba hamba sahayamu yang perempuan jika mereka miskin akan memampukan mereka dengan karunia nya yughnikumullah min fadhlihi dan maha luas pemberian nya lagi maha mengetahui
3307646 bukan termasuk golonganku orang orang yang merasa khawatir akan terkungkung hidupnya karena menikah kemudian ia tidak menikah
3307647 barangsiapa mempunyai anak perempuan yang telah mencapai usia dua belas tahun lalu ia tidak segera mengawinkannya kemudian anak perempuannya tersebut melakukan suatu perbuatan dosa maka dosanya ditanggung oleh dia ayahnya
3307648 jika datang kepada kalian wahai calon mertua orang yang kalian sukai ketaatan agamanya dan akhlaknya maka nikahkanlah dia dengan putrimu sebab jika kamu sekalian tidak melakukannya akan lahir fitnah bencana dan akan berkembang kehancuran yang besar di muka bumi
3307649 orang meninggal diantara kalian yang berada dalam kehinaan adalah bujangan

3307656 sumber informasi yang tidak seimbang adalah ciri khas sebuah propaganda isu terorisme tampaknya juga seperti itu as lah yang paling diuntungkan dengan isu ini
3307657 as pastilah membutuhkan legitimasi dalam setiap intervensinya di dunia kalau dalam perang dingin membendung komunisme dijadikan alat pasca perang dinging perang melawan terorisme dijadikan legitimasi
3307658 demikian bagian isi dari strategi pertahanan as untuk tahun 2008
3307659 saat ini kita sedang bertempur dalam perang melawan teror perang yang akan kita menangkan perang yang lebih besar yang kita hadapi adalah perang pemikiran jelas suatu tantangan tetapi sesuatu yang juga harus kita menangkan
3307660 kemenangan sebenarnya tidak akan muncul hanya karena teroris dikalahkan dengan kekerasan tetapi karena ideologi kematian dan kebencian dikalahkan
3307661 perjuangan yang terjadi di hampir semua negara muslim pada esensinya adalah sebuah perang ide hasil peperangan ini akan menentukan masa depan dunia islam

3307663 we are sure that he has a great deal to contribute to the recovery and growth of the woolworths group
3307664 so you have had experience with georgian units interesting thanks contradicts the claims some people make about georgian army being ready to take back ossetia and abkhazia because of some us aid
3307665 the phenomenon of a small country standing up to russian might is not their invention
3307666 we faced that situation for many years and no one wanted to help us because they were afraid of the russians and of the arabs
3307667 he has a lot of friends to this day in israel and hes maintained good relations with them
3307668 the israelis ought to be proud of the fact that georgian soldiers received israeli education and training and are fighting like i dont know what
3307669 and our hope is to receive assistance from the white house because alone georgia wont be able to endure its important that everywhere in the world people understand that what is happening in georgia now is going to affect world order this isnt only georgias business but the business of the entire region
3307670 we wont be able to stop the russian aggression by military force only we need help from the un and from our friends as well first and foremost the united states and israel today it is a danger to georgia tomorrow it will be a danger to all the democratic countries in the region and in the entire world
3307671 israel needs to be very careful and sensitive these days
3307672 the russians are selling many arms to iran and syria and there is no need to offer them an excuse to sell even more advanced weapons
3307673 this isnt another one of those israeli weapons deals again
3307674 my early years in grammar school were uneventful and a period when i drifted along quite happy to play and enjoy life
3307675 i honestly dont remember preparing for any examinations until the gces came along when i remember only revising a week before the exams
3307676 the results were inevitable and had to be compensated for later well into the next 30 years eventually i passed an open examination to
3307677 most of my schoolboy contemporaries continue to be astonished by what i eventually achieved with such roles as visiting professor at stirling university and chief examiner of the chartered institute of bankers
3307678 i think that it was then that i realised that i could do whatever i set my mind to
3307679 i also realised that the harder you worked in your job the faster time goes and there is also a link to your ultimate success and that is a maxim to which ive adhered since it never occurred to me that i was going to become managing director of a bank
3307680 when i later got a job with the national provincial i said to my wife lynda dont worry i will get a proper job back then the thought of going to work in a bank wasnt exactly sexy
3307681 i was 50 and was working for the co operative on theories of management in terms of prolonged success
3307682 one of the things that became obvious was that progressive management thinking and practice since the 18th century has by coincidence rather than design slowly moved towards natures evolved and proven management systems
3307683 i remember talking this through at a function when we were in the process of developing the banks strategy and a biologist named paul monaghan now the head of sustainable development overheard my comments
3307684 he told me that what i was saying was the latest thinking in terms of biological systems in the living world
3307685 the board thought i was crackers to commit the bank to an environmental policy
3307686 im immensely proud that the co operative has continued to develop its ethical and environmental policies following my retirement and has also gone on to win numerous national and international awards on the back of them
3307687 i can say that i will always be grateful that i was unaware of the hole in my heart until doctors started carrying out tests following the stroke
3307688 i believe that it might have caused me not to forge ahead with my life and career
3307689 when i was undergoing physio following the stroke i was instructed to walk 400 metres but i went out and found myself walking for four miles before collapsing and getting taken home by one of my three sons
3307690 one of the things that the physio wrote on my notes was a driven man and i suppose all things being considered that she could well have hit the nail on the head
3307691 wilfried dietrich den man ja nicht nur in schifferstadt den kran von schifferstadt nennt
3307692 vielleicht wissen ja einige von ihnen noch nicht dass wilfried dietrich auch der kran von schifferstadt genannt wird

3307703 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at his wife rhonda
3307704 she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
3307705 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
3307706 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
3307707 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
3307708 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
3307709 he represented a kind of hood attitude and cultural phenomenon that was under exploited in america but had great potential
3307710 he was always honest and that honesty was what he exuded and what made him so great
3307711 its a terrible loss i mean you need funny in your life at all times he was definitely one who brought it one of the best comedians ive ever really experienced and condolences go out to everyone in his family
3307712 bernie is just ridiculous with it or he was so god bless his family god bless his soul but bernie was that dude for real so rest in peace man
3307713 the most disappointing thing the most incredible thing is that nobody caught it
3307714 we will continue to be vocal about the destructive effect of this film we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3307715 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from
3307716 the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
3307717 some people have taken this as making fun of handicapped people but were really trying to make fun of the actors who use this material as fodder for acclaim
3307718 the last thing you want is for people to think youre making fun of the victims in this who are having their lives turned into fodder for people to win oscars
3307719 movies about the mentally retarded is something we talked about for a long time my grandfather was adopted by a mentally retarded man a man who shouldnt have been allowed to adopt a kid
3307720 when he saw forrest gump you never saw a guy angrier than him it was not such a picnic to be raised by that guy
3307721 the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities we have had productive discussions with representatives of disability advocacy organizations and look forward to working with them closely in the future
3307722 however no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3307723 it seemed so weird last time we spoke you admitted to a lifelong fear of condiments i dont want to get you upset
3307724 the lord of the rings the return of the king

3307726 the detection of a new avian influenza virus strain in africa raises serious concerns as it remains unknown how this strain has been introduced to the continent
3307727 it seems to be unlikely that wild birds have carried the strain to africa since the last migration of wild birds from europe and central asia to africa occurred in september 2007 and this years southerly migration into africa has not really started yet
3307728 it could well be that there are other channels for virus introduction international trade for example or illegal and unreported movement of poultry this increases the risk of avian influenza spread to other countries in western africa
3307729 uncertainty about virus spread and transmission is a major challenge for control campaigns increased surveillance is key to monitor the situation and keep track of virus spread
3307730 fao greatly appreciates nigerias swift reporting and sharing of the relevant information about this new virus strain
3307731 many countries have succeeded in getting the virus under control but as long as avian influenza remains endemic in some countries the international community needs to be on alert both at risk and affected countries have to keep a high level of surveillance
3307732 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hard core family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
3307733 one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have
3307734 losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
3307735 he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather
3307736 i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement
3307737 a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives
3307738 his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set
3307739 bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real
3307740 that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
3307741 i want this to end when im on top so im planning my final show on december 21 2012 its when the mayan calendar ends its the day when solids become liquids and liquids become plasmas
3307742 so im building up to that weve got four years so maybe theres going to be a couple other small releases in the works the album just came out so i have no plans for another release but im constantly starting to work on new stuff just for the live shows
3307743 i used to play very short sets and now i kinda play a standard 45 minute to one hour set so i think i wanna do a 24 hour set and i want it to be a stage production but one where the lines become blurry between reality and complete stage me i want it to be an endurance test and i want it to be miserable and equally fantastic i want the best of both worlds
3307744 i think in too many shows people are too aimed at pleasing the audience if you want to do a really great show which i havent fully done yet you have to really make it bad for them for like 20 hours and then you can kill it for four hours and everyone will be really excited i think people ignore the dynamics of how you can work with an audience
3307745 sigur c ne pare r u c nu au putut s fim acolo i am v zut totul la televizor dar asta a fost destinul nostru
3307746 aici e mult mai frumos c nd eram la shanghai era ca i cum am fi evoluat la un turneu pentru echipe under 20 dar acum ne sim im cu adev rat la jocurile olimpice

3307753 the lack of mortgage finance has brought the housing market to a
3307754 going forward there are signs that sales activity might pick up a little as
3307755 however the current confused messages from the government regarding stamp duty risks damaging any returning confidence and may discourage mobility
3307756 i go over to sean and i guess he didnt know i was wearing a prosthetic you are such a great actor you wouldnt do a scene like this if they asked you wouldnt dive into the pool naked and he said not knowing i was wearing a prosthetic well james if i was built like you i would
3307757 la d tection dune nouvelle souche de linfluenza aviaire en afrique suscite de graves pr occupations car on ne sait pas encore comment elle a t introduite sur le continent

3307763 we use it right across everything from operational to commercial
3307764 we use it to plan land use studies and centrally control vehicle movements for building management and leaseholds and demographic data on passengers and employees
3307765 its been an open ended software system thats grown with us and weve been able to upgrade the functionality as the airport has grown
3307766 for employees it helps plan shift patterns and transport links into the site and for passengers it helps understand how and when they travel and their spending power
3307767 the package gives us the ability to amalgamate database tables and land diaries and were able to show them on a map
3307768 it allows us to create address lists of people who live within our sound insulation grant areas and it gives us a good neighbour policy that keeps them informed
3307769 we hope to be working with the transport infrastructure fund and the greater manchester passenger transport executive on transport networks
3307770 we realised that digital methods are completely non invasive this aspect becomes very significant when the remains you are dealing with are in poor condition we recently worked on some viking skulls that were paper thin and our use of the fastscan meant we barely had to touch them
3307771 we have some big players interested and are in talks with some of the biggest leasing companies in the industry
3307772 we already have 20 dealers in the uk and have had inquiries from south africa and iceland
3307773 this modification is within the manufacturers guidelines and is fully tested and proven
3307774 tomorrow the new record releases its just a really amazing time in our lives

3307780 a considerable proportion of overweight and obese u s adults are metabolically healthy whereas a considerable proportion of normal weight adults express a clustering of cardiometabolic abnormalities
3307781 our study shows you can still be healthy even if you are obese
3307782 altogether 10 percent of the study population and 25 percent of the obese subjects had a high insulin sensitivity phenotype or metabolically benign obesity
3307783 our data suggest that ectopic fat accumulation in the liver may be more important than visceral fat in the determination of such a beneficial phenotype in obesity
3307784 thats an area that we are very intrigued with as well
3307785 if you start stuffing people with calories it is very much like making pate from goose liver

3307793 there was a little boy who was three years old and a small girl who was about one and a half a police spokesman said
3307794 its an absolute tragedy any loss of life is particularly children can devastate a small community

3307797 well i am also childish and i hate to lose
3307798 i lost my mama i went through so much drama i went through so much drama im for obama
3307799 its not a black or white thing its not a rap or rock and roll thing
3307800 its a good music thing we jam about good things from the heart how can you pick between me and trent reznor
3307801 i hope you had a good time f that the time of your life
3307802 not like the writers and producers at motown or quincy jones but he was on that level in my opinion
3307803 he gave me my voice he taught me showed me and nurtured my voice he didnt teach me how to sing he taught me how to be a better singer that was isaac
3307804 he didnt have a choreographer he didnt have a show
3307805 isaac would just get up there and sit down and become one with the song he was doing and you would look out and the women would be hanging on every word it made me wish my voice was that deep
3307806 i met isaac hayes when i was on the road with james brown in the 70s
3307807 we played a few festivals together in my later years i got to know the man behind the music he was the first official black man to be known as a real rapper and he had nothing but praise for his queens and women of the world
3307808 hayes was so musically advanced and timeless in his compositions he was loved and appreciated by so many he was an enduring symbol of the struggle of the african american man and was a shining example of soul at its best
3307809 although he was under the weather he was still performing
3307810 he was the man he had the show must go on spirit in his absence he will be remembered through his great music he will forever be in our hearts and souls
3307811 i am deeply saddened by the loss of isaac hayes a true historic world music figure
3307812 isaac hayes was the first african american to win an oscar for a music score but never lost sight of his commitment to his community and the betterment of mankind he was more than an artist he was a trailblazer he was an innovator
3307813 i tried to be as real as i possibly could
3307814 and i keyed in on the character shaft the character himself
3307815 i think the songs out there today when the kids talk about romance i think theyre too blatant they dont leave enough for the imagination
3307816 i like to use metaphors thats right and take it slow and easy and then build its kind of like foreplay you dont want to get there too soon else its all over its like eating candy just gobbling it down and then i want some more and its gone you have to savor it

3307830 some very serious questions to answer on his return to australia
3307831 mr rudd must tell west australians whether the 134 000 job losses will occur in this state and if so where and in which parts of the economy and in which businesses she said
3307832 he has to answer why there was a 2 billion tax hike on gas condensate a 2 billion tax hike on the north west shelf which we believe will be passed onto domestic gas users in this state
3307833 and he must also answer why he has done nothing to reduce grocery or oil prices as he promised to do at the last election
3307834 mr rudd does have history of a relationship with brian burke that he tried to avoid in the lead up to the federal election ms bishop said
3307835 all those issues of his dealings with brian burke and how honest he was with the australian people about his relations with brian burke will be the focus of his visit here
3307836 weve already had five ministers resign since the last election how many more would be resigning if wed heard from the ccc on this governments shady dealings ms bishop said
3307837 jo and siennas dad ed had a few concerns as any parents would
3307838 sienna knew they would get on really well balthazar is a lovely guy
3307839 balthazar thinks its a bit soon for sienna to meet his children that is something that will come with time but he is obviously secure enough in their relationship to want to show off his new love to his friends
3307840 kelly was the ultimate host and even when the bar bill began to spiral out of control she didnt close the tab
3307841 at one point kelly started dancing and put on a silly hat which made everyone laugh
3307842 bono arrived quite late and kelly told him to order whatever he wanted
3307843 kissing him wasnt that bad but he did have to stop and shave in the middle of a scene even though hed shaved that morning the man has really got some beard on him
3307844 i worship woody and id do anything in one of his movies
3307845 im so fortunate to be in a very solid and comfortable relationship
3307846 the healthiest and most inspiring relationships are the ones where youre so comfortable with the other person that you actually learn more about yourself that you could never appreciate before

3307848 i have to have fun with it or ill turn into britney shave my head and go totally crazy
3307849 i get a lot of wrinkled noses because of how outspoken i am
3307850 probably not in the uk because women here tend to be pretty frank and have a dry sense of humour but back home theyre scared of me for some reason and think im a little nutty
3307851 when mercy is no longer a baby we want her back i do not want the money they said theyd give me
3307852 it was painful and a big struggle and i didnt understand it in the end i rationalised that when a woman goes through natural childbirth she suffers an enormous amount i went through my own kind of birthing pains

3307863 for the last three or four summers weve been going over to europe and doing all the festivals and it looks like we just totally ignored our fans in america but thats not the case as a consequence the american fans miss us and they want their metallica so this will be a good homecoming for them and us
3307864 we were talking to lars and he goes were going to take you guys on tour
3307865 there are very few people driving to this festival its a huge mass transit event and i think that alone must save a tremendous amount of fuel and help from an emissions standpoint
3307866 i think its great how transportation by ferry is being so encouraged
3307867 and they made it really hard to get parking passes so that keeps it green
3307868 the line was so long i was like what is this
3307869 that takes a lot of extra effort and extra money but the artists were very conscious about not throwing stuff away
3307870 were not adding tons of plastic and paper plates backstage but its a small thing and theres probably a ways to go there
3307871 my girlfriend drives a hybrid and i quit turning my lights on when i go to the restroom
3307872 these artists are out there not to beat people over the head but to increase awareness of a lot of different issues
3307873 in a pretty easy way it creates a little consciousness about what happens when you throw it away
3307874 lets pick it all up lets get a little reward for doing so and it will also keep the grounds looking a lot nicer for everyone throughout the weekend
3307875 for us to accomplish that mission we needed to shed a lot of extra baggage
3307876 we needed to focus a little more we needed to make quicker decisions we needed to be ok saying no to certain stuff and we needed to weed through stuff quicker
3307877 one of the coolest things was rick actually suggested that we all stand up and rock out like we would live
3307878 and we did and it put a lot of life into the basic tracking of it all it was almost to the point where when i was retracking stuff i was standing up headbanging id never done that in a recording situation before hes a great song doctor and he has great ears
3307879 the great thing about working with rick is hes never around
3307880 i would say thats a very strong point in that it leaves the four of us to take on the entire brunt of the work and the planning that goes into the songwriting process and the recording process
3307881 bob would add a lot of his own musical input and with that came a lot of his own influences and style and jurisdiction and idiosyncrasies
3307882 and it would eventually make it into our sound but with rick because he wasnt there its almost 100 percent undiluted metallica hed come in and say thats good that isnt change that and we would have to figure that out for ourselves this is the most pure weve sounded in a long time
3307883 rick is not the kind of producer like a bob rock whos there every moment holding your hand making you step up
3307884 rock arranged everything all the time and wore many hats in the studio rick rubin no hat rick comes in and goes well wheres the songs ok thats good thats not so good more of this less of that see you in a few months goodbye and thats what we needed that brutal honesty to get through it and it worked
3307885 the slipknot that he did the system of a down records he did and even the johnny cash stuff where its the essence of him and you hear him you hear whats going on thats what i want i want people to really hear metallica
3307886 so in a way its got somewhat of an older sound songs and arrangement wise weve got a lot more diversity on the record instrumentals fast shorter songs epic ballady moments its quite different from st anger where if youre angry this is your album and if youre not it might take some work
3307887 is that the same guy who used to shake the ground when he walked
3307888 he looks so different i wonder what program hes on
3307889 if you think youre too small to make a difference youve never been in bed with a mosquito

3307895 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3307896 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3307897 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3307898 the advance casts doubts on russias claim that this five day war is just a peacekeeping operation
3307899 this war is all about russia and the message russias sending to the world this is putins announcement that russia is back as a great power
3307900 we have to understand these russian troops didnt materialize out of nowhere
3307901 this is the culmination of putins efforts to pull georgia back within russias sphere and exert control over it

3307905 bitterly disappointed at a wasted opportunity to help the nhs and its workforce
3307906 this is an extraordinary own goal which underlines the way that so much nhs support for cycling is mere lip service there is no overall promotion of sustainable transport in the nhs and many trusts neither know nor care what cyclists need yet the few trusts who actively encourage staff to cycle on short business journeys reap tremendous benefits healthier employees improved public health less competition for car park spaces reduced carbon emissions and it saves the nhs money
3307907 it is difficult to see what difference the grudging half hearted increase in the cycle mileage rate will have
3307908 it is ridiculous that spokes and its members face this continual up hill struggle to persuade the national health service to do something which benefits health and saves money the nhs sustainable development unit and spokes both recommended a bicycle mileage increase to 20p in line with the government set tax threshold there is no explanation of why the nhs chose to set the new rate at 10p or what this is intended to achieve the members of spokes are bitterly disappointed at a wasted opportunity to help the nhs and its workforce

3307937 theres a difference between wanting to prove that you could get pregnant and wanting to be a mother
3307938 the whole topic is fraught with so much then theres the area of adoption surrogacy fertility clinics and the ways of the future to making babies bringing questions about the ethics and repercussions
3307939 i think this is such a loaded topic and an emotional topic hopefully if people have been through something like this in any way the film might be a relief for them and a way to find humour in the situation
3307940 i think the idea of wanting a family and wanting a baby in your life is a universal one no matter how you arrive at it but theres something about big life milestone moments moments that are rites of passage always seem to lend themselves to comedy whether its going to your prom losing your virginity getting married or having a baby
3307941 i personally got very lucky i got a baby under the wire thats how i like to say it i was 35 and i know im very very lucky
3307942 i was able to remember the feelings of mid 30s baby lust that kind of overtakes you and surprises you and then the fear that its not going to work out
3307943 the baby is the only good part the diapers are not great the hours are dreadful they really are babies are very cute

3307946 but thankfully working at saturday night live you do get a little more accustomed to standing next to a giant movie star and find a way to just forget who they are and do the scene with them its a great way to get used to it otherwise the whole time youd be freaked out that youre looking at ripley from alien
3307947 then seeing saturday night live and a show called sctv canadian sketch show second city television i just wanted to do that now its a different time there are more and more female comics
3307948 i dont think its the only way i think sometimes youre tapping into things that make you angry or things that embarrass you
3307949 i do think you have to be willing to be ugly or embarrassing at moments but i think there are also people who are very normal in their lives who are great comedians i think jerry seinfeld is normal not a tortured soul at all from what ive observed even steve martin is very business like and hard working as a comic and isnt putting his fist through a hotel mirror every night that i know of
3307950 30 rock was shot in new york so i could go home every night and i could bring my daughter to the set and because i didnt write the movie i would have the weekends off and i would really be off not writing

3307984 a pesar de esto el pa s invert a m s fondos en hacer ruido el primero de diciembre d a dedicado al sida que en la comunicaci n sobre malaria diarrea o vacunaci n
3307985 lo que necesitamos son 365 d as de atenci n a los problemas
3307986 creen que hacer mucho ruido una vez al a o les confiere visibilidad los d as internacionales los ven como un asunto de visibilidad no de cambio social
3307987 de entrada me parece muy buena idea este tipo de fechas pero su multiplicaci n impide que la gente las recuerde y como todo lo que acaba siendo muy frecuente se deval a de alguna manera pierde el impacto
3307988 un pretexto para dar m s visibilidad p blica a los mensajes de cada d a aunque en ese d a no se tomen medidas contra el tr gico problema del campo de refugiados de darfur sud n pero no es suficiente recordarlo una vez al a o
3307989 parece que al establecer un d a mundial los problemas se resuelven no es malo que exista un d a para el medio ambiente el problema es c mo lo utilizan las empresas y las administraciones p blicas porque hacen un lavado de imagen y no se profundiza sobre las causas
3307990 los d as mundiales no deben ocultar que detr s de ellos hay movimientos ciudadanos que est n trabajando d a a d a generando unos valores como el cuidado del medio ambiente o la salud p blica contra el tabaco y que est n dando resultados
3307991 el cambio clim tico no es una nueva religi n es un problema una cuesti n sobre la que se discute y sobre la que se tiene que trabajar si hubiera una nueva religi n ser a la del consumo
3307992 muy necesarias ayudan a concienciarse a sensibilizarse en torno a los grandes problemas de la humanidad los que tienen que ver con el mundo de la pobreza el medio ambiente la paz la salud integral el fanatismo
3307993 que se fije en la mente de las gentes a trav s de esl ganes o a trav s de una pedagog a informativa es importante porque la sociedad actual es muy insensible est muy embotada por unos discursos por una publicidad de car cter muy consumista con unas fuertes connotaciones fr volas y eso perjudica sobremanera a la conciencia c vica y a la conciencia humanitaria
3307994 das kann ich nicht unterschreiben sagte ich wieder ich glaube nicht daran dass wir die welt ndern k nnen indem wir die systeme ndern wir m ssen die menschen ndern allem voran uns selbst und dann spielt es keine rolle welches system wir haben
3307995 has there been any attempt to heal the rift yeah that will be right
3307996 they put a bid in i dont know if it was fax or letter or whatever just one it was sometime in the summer
3307997 but the final decision was taken at the end of the season when the first nonsense appeared and cristiano referred to his future being decided in the next few days it was decided there and then he was staying there was never any change in our stance
3307998 the many millions who tuned in for the opening ceremony are a good omen for that and the encouraging news continued with the audience figures for the first full day of action
3307999 the olympic opening ceremony captivated the american public in unprecedented numbers for a non u s olympics it was a magical and memorable spectacle and a great way to start the beijing olympics

3308032 the law is quite clear clubs pay for any policing inside the ground and on immediately adjacent property under their control on matchday
3308033 any other provision deemed necessary is covered by the state its what people pay their taxes for with the premier league alone contributing more that 700m a year to the treasury let alone the tax take from the 13 million fans who attend premier league games during the course of a season
3308034 this long established principle applies to all individuals and organisations in the uk from private individuals to shopping centres pubs and major events like the notting hill carnival
3308035 our clubs work well with their local police forces to make sure that the call on their resources is as little as possible
3308036 they have invested heavily in all seater stadia cctv and stewarding and as a result the numbers of police required to ensure public safety and therefore the cost has reduced over the past 15 years
3308037 we are always happy to discuss how it might be possible to further reduce costs or indeed how football can help the police tackle youth crime but we fail to see why football fans should pay twice for policing
3308038 the cash we get given to police our various areas across the country thats provided by government thats provided by people through council tax and the provision of that is to provide a policing service to those areas and to those communities
3308039 if we have to take officers away from them to police football we are not able to recover the cost of that that means our normal police budget is being used for that purpose which means we then have to provide a lesser service to the rest of the community

3308047 in conclusion the lowest 25 oh d quartile less than 17 8 nanograms per milliliter is associated with a higher risk of all cause mortality in the general u s population
3308048 further observational studies are needed to confirm these findings and establish the mechanisms underlying these observations if confirmed randomized clinical trials will be needed to determine whether vitamin d supplementation at higher doses could have any potential benefit in reducing future mortality risk in those with 25 oh d deficiency
3308049 the current conflict between russia and georgia over the breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia has been widely viewed as a throwback to the cold war era with georgia seeking to reassert control over areas it considers part of its sovereign territory and russia aiming to punish a regime it deems overly friendly to the west
3308050 as for the future your task is not to forsee it but to enable it
3308051 while we are confident scotlands economy is well placed to address the challenges presented by the current economic climate the scottish government will do all we can to support key industries like the energy sector which has the potential to make a significant contribution towards our goal of increased sustainable economic growth despite international challenges the value of our oil is an all time high yet we have still to reap the full benefits of our natural resources a scottish oil fund a concept supported by over 80 per cent of people in scotland can deliver direct and long term benefits the norwegian oil fund for example was only created in the mid 1990s with relatively small initial payments yet is now worth some 200 billion with over half of the revenue from scottish oil still to come now is the time to develop a fund for future generations
3308052 when that happens the servicemember should not have to incur the cost of the move
3308053 this change in the joint federal travel regulation ensures that they are financially protected when this happens and shows that we as a department care about our troops and their welfare
3308054 very likely we are going to end up with a national climate change initiative
3308055 not as the south is going to take a hit but as lets talk now about how the south adapts
3308056 i can tell you right now im against taxing carbon people in my state pay more for gasoline right now than we want them to pay and their electric bills are higher than we want them to be
3308057 we support a national program to deal with a worldwide issue we dont support these sort of state policies
3308058 when the next presidential administration comes in we want them to have an idea of what the policy is going to look like
3308059 we wanted to share our academic work with the security community and had planned to withhold a key detail of our results so that a malicious attacker could not use our research for fraudulent purposes
3308060 were disappointed that the court is preventing us from presenting our findings even with this safeguard
3308061 the courts order is an illegal prior restraint on legitimate academic research in violation of the first amendment
3308062 the court has adopted an interpretation of the statute that is blatantly unconstitutional equating discussion in a public forum with computer intrusion security and the public interest benefit immensely from the free flow of ideas and information on vulnerabilities more importantly squelching research and scientific discussion wont stop the attackers it will just stop the public from knowing that these systems are vulnerable and from pressuring the companies that develop and implement them to fix security holes
3308063 we are fulfilling our agreement with the georgian government that in an emergency we would assist them in redeploying their troops
3308064 we are honoring that commitment and we are following through with that
3308065 commanders on the ground are making necessary adjustments to mitigate any of the impact of the loss of georgian forces
3308066 quite frankly these were good soldiers but weve been able to adapt at the battle space to account for their loss
3308067 i not only said it to russian prime minister vladimir putin ive said it to the president of the country dmitriy medvedev

3308069 they beat me like a dog political persecution of opposition activists and supporters in zimbabwe
3308070 zanu pf and its allies are still committing violent abuses undermining the partys credibility as a political partner
3308071 instead of focusing on quick political fixes president thabo mbeki and other sadc leaders should look for a durable solution and that means first of all an immediate end to human rights violations
3308072 i am an old woman and they beat me like a dog no a wild animal they insulted me they beat me on the back and in the ribs my only crime was that my son was an mdc councilor i am in great pain now my son is in the mortuary i am unable to bury him i will not be there when he is buried if he is buried i regret being alive my life is ruined my home is destroyed and my sons life was taken in cold blood
3308073 there can be no trade off between the political process and the need for justice and an end to human rights abuses said gagnon
3308074 the zimbabwean governments refusal to account for serious crimes will only damage the prospects for political stability in zimbabwe sadc leaders can make a difference by insisting that abusers be held to account under any political deal
3308075 from the day before yesterday the average occupancy rate in beijing hotels was 81 2 percent which is quite a good level though of course lower than the peak period
3308076 we have done a survey on cities which have hosted previous olympics generally speaking regular visitors will avoid the peak period during the olympic games only athletes coaches and fans will visit then
3308077 according to previous experiences the peak period for tourism in host cities is once the olympics have ended
3308078 tightening visas is mainly to ensure that athletes and people who want to come and watch the games can
3308079 over this period we are mainly guaranteeing that athletes and fans who want to watch the olympics can come as planned
3308080 some visitors may think its more complex to get a visa but there are no special restrictions in place

3308083 until the 19th century it was purely nationalist dutch thinking to suppose that laurens janszoon coster was the inventor of book printing and that gutenberg stole his idea

3308092 our study shows that early weight loss can reduce the risk factors that so often lead to diabetes complications and death
3308093 weve known for a long time that weight loss is an important component in diabetes treatment and prevention now it appears there may be a critical window of opportunity following diagnosis in which some lasting gains can be achieved if people are willing to take immediate steps toward lifestyle changes
3308094 we dont know if the initial weight loss increased the bodys sensitivity to insulin or if the sustained lifestyle changes were the reason for the long term health benefits
3308095 but we do know that losing weight reduces the risk factors that often lead to heart disease blindness nerve and kidney damage amputations and death in type 2 diabetes patients
3308096 this is an extremely rare case of co infection in a controlled monogamous relationship which showed us how a strong immune system in the elite suppressor kept the virus from replicating and infecting other cells
3308097 our findings offer hope to vaccine researchers because they reveal that the immune systems primary offense known as cd8 killer t cells can effectively halt disease progression by a pathogenic form of hiv
3308098 moreover the strength of the immune response was not dependent on infection by a weakened form of the virus and if we can harness the means by which these elite white blood cells stop the virus then we can hopefully teach or reprogram white blood cells in others to also target hiv
3308099 the presence of this genetic spot is a discordant result that strongly contradicts theories that various genetic factors alone play a protective role in suppression
3308100 elite suppression offers clues to vaccine researchers on many fronts how cd8 killer t cells can attack hiv and how a stronger immune response can force hiv into a permanent defensive state
3308101 our results are very important from a public health perspective
3308102 the u s population is aging rapidly and falls are a leading cause of mortality and morbidity among adults age 65 and older falls are associated with an enormous burden to individuals society and to the health care system tai chi as a proven fall intervention may have much to offer in terms of reducing the public health burden of falls and the benefits accrued for prevention

3308106 demostrarles que los pescadores son mucho m s agresivos con la naturaleza que los propios molinos
3308107 si los pescadores est n en contra es porque los molinos les impedir an practicar la pesca de arrastre que es ilegal
3308108 s lo sabemos que estamos en el mapa de la e lica marina pero nadie nos ha informado de forma oficial de d nde quieren poner los molinos
3308109 lo que ha sucedido all es que se han creado islas de vida artificiales alrededor de los pilones de los molinos
3308110 son lugares donde no se puede pescar y los animales se refugian all

3308115 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3308116 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3308117 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces

3308121 just a week after the legal notice was received officers were called to the address during an out of hours emergency by a neighbour
3308122 environmental health staff in the front room of the property next to wiosnas could hear the music so clearly they could pick out the lyrics

3308139 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3308140 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3308141 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3308142 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3308143 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos

3308158 breastfeeding promotion programs encourage women to start but dont provide the support to continue
3308159 we are finding that breastfeeding rates arent just explained by the individuals who live in these areas theres something about the areas themselves and breastfeeding
3308160 its a sad irony both in terms of health needs and the expense these families incur buying formula
3308161 we already know that ptks are associated with several types of aggressive cancers including colon breast and lung cancers
3308162 what we have discovered is that ptks have an important role to play as cancer cells grow and mutate to become potentially more aggressive tumours
3308163 the more we can learn about how tumours develop the more we are able to prevent their growth in the future there are already drugs that inhibit particular ptks in the late stages of treatment our discovery could change the timing of when and how those or similar drugs are administered
3308164 our studies have shown that ptk pathways are intimately associated with the regulation of checkpoint responses during dna replication
3308165 we have identified one mechanism by which ptks may remain activated and allow cancer cells to bypass the molecular warden of dna replication they may lack a key enzyme called tcptp
3308166 but the big question remains what happens in the real world of human cancers
3308167 we mixed soil samples with scrapie pathogens to find out how long the pathogens would survive
3308168 even after 29 months in other words more than two years we were still able to detect prions in the soil
3308169 the soil actually seems to increase the infectiousness of the pathogens the incubation period the time it takes for the disease to break out is exceedingly short even after the prions have persisted in the soil for 29 months all of the animals that were given contaminated soil became sick within a very short time these results indicate that fresh incidences of scrapie among sheep are due to contaminated pastures
3308170 to find this out we urgently need to carry out further tests the appropriate research applications have already been submitted
3308171 we know that parents have tremendous influence over how many fruits and vegetables their children eat
3308172 when parents eat more fruits and vegetables so do their children when parents eat and give their children high fat snacks or soft drinks children learn these eating patterns instead
3308173 this research shows that its important to communicate with parents in real world settings
3308174 they control the food environment for their young child this environment is key to not only what children eat today but how they will eat in the future
3308175 overweight children have already been exposed to salty sweet foods and learned to like them
3308176 to keep a child from becoming overweight parents need to expose them early to a variety of healthy foods and offer the foods many times

3308179 we now have a central mechanism we can use as a tool to look for triggers in the genome that work with hox and sens to regulate the formation of neurons and blood cells
3308180 this allows us to identify other key genes downstream of hox and sens determine their role in development based on what happens with cell fate decisions and look for the causes of birth defects and disease

3308206 performing plantings is a never ending process unless the causes of plant losses are understood and addressed
3308207 considering what is known about past species changes in inwood park and other new york city parks the new york city parks department natural resources group ecological restoration efforts would benefit from structured scientific research on plantings survival through partnerships with scientists who have studied the ecology of new york city parks
3308208 todays plantings for the ecological restoration of inwood park are similar to private estate plantings done following the american revolution period which have been decimated by subsequent use and management of the land
3308209 the forest and wetland communities of inwood hill park are more diverse and have a greater structural variation than revealed by previous research
3308210 considering the results of this research on the long term ecology of the inwood park forest the natural resources group could avoid the problem observed by spanish born american poet and philosopher george santayana those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it

3308222 the detection of a new avian influenza virus strain in africa raises serious concerns as it remains unknown how this strain has been introduced to the continent
3308223 it seems to be unlikely that wild birds have carried the strain to africa since the last migration of wild birds from europe and central asia to africa occurred in september 2007 and this years southerly migration into africa has not really started yet
3308224 it could well be that there are other channels for virus introduction international trade for example or illegal and unreported movement of poultry this increases the risk of avian influenza spread to other countries in western africa
3308225 uncertainty about virus spread and transmission is a major challenge for control campaigns increased surveillance is key to monitor the situation and keep track of virus spread
3308226 fao greatly appreciates nigerias swift reporting and sharing of the relevant information about this new virus strain
3308227 many countries have succeeded in getting the virus under control but as long as avian influenza remains endemic in some countries the international community needs to be on alert both at risk and affected countries have to keep a high level of surveillance
3308228 these datasets could form the basis of more comprehensive area level health and well being profiles across the island that will help health planners to tailor health and social services to meet local needs
3308229 this data allows people to look at the health situation in their own county or in their own local government district we are beginning to build a picture of health at the local level allowing people and planers to see how they compare with others in their jurisdiction and across the island
3308230 these datasets highlight many differences in health and well being across the island and we hope will stimulate interest in why this is so and what can be learnt from other areas that face similar issues
3308231 for instance weve learned that when someone has a haploid insufficiency and is missing one copy of the tgf gene he or she is more vulnerable to environmental insults that can cause cleft palate such as drugs smoking and alcohol
3308232 we found that if we blocked tgf or the receptors a cleft palate develops
3308233 but when smad4 was blocked normal palate epithelium still covered the palatal shelf
3308234 this information is useful not just for palate and teeth but also for cancer and cell biology in general
3308235 ultimately we have to be translational in order to make ourselves useful to patients
3308236 if brain damage related to alzheimers disease begins earlier in adult life then having less reserve due to a smaller brain could compromise intellectual ability in those destined to get alzheimers and lead to them getting less education
3308237 although it has been known for many years that individuals with lower education have a greater risk of getting alzheimers this is the first report showing that reduced educational attainment may actually be an early sign of the underlying disease
3308238 these findings are important because while genes that cause hpe have been identified the interactions among those that produce hpe are not only complex but poorly understood
3308239 this represents a first step in understanding the mechanism of that interaction
3308240 this is good evidence for what has been called the multi hit model of hpe
3308241 in this model it takes mutations in both six3 and other genes in the sonic hedgehog pathway to produce the severe pathology of hpe
3308242 sonic hedgehog is a major player in embryonic development in the brain as well as elsewhere in the body
3308243 so this new understanding of its regulation in this very limited time and place in the brain helps us understand at a molecular level some of its overall role in brain formation
3308244 findings from this study suggest the significant role that built environment plays in either positively or negatively impacting our health and or lifestyle
3308245 34 of u s adults aged 20 and over are obese part of the rise in this disease may be attributed to our surroundings for example increased accessibility to unhealthy foods the built environment is also creating barriers for our ability to exercise many neighborhood areas lack parks and other recreational facilities and suburbs are often designed to discourage neighborhood walking simply focusing on encouraging people to change their lifestyles to eat better and to get more exercise is insufficient measures are also needed to improve features of the built environment which are often modifiable e g via changes in city zoning development policies to support people in making such changes
3308246 we now have a better idea of where these brain tumors come from and their relationship to normal stem cells in the brain
3308247 medulloblastoma was one of the first tumors that was believed to fit the hypothesis that tumors are caused by cancer stem cells that initiate malignancies and sustain them
3308248 but the prevailing hypothesis that medulloblastomas originate from non stem cells just did not make perfect sense with this
3308249 there must be susceptibility factors in the granule neuron precursor cell that predispose it to forming cancer so we now must try to understand what it is about this cell type that makes it susceptible to forming cancer in response to sonic hedgehog signaling this relationship between stem cells and oncogenes suggests a new point of potential therapeutic intervention
3308250 understanding how elephants and other animal populations react to droughts will be a central component of wildlife management and conservation
3308251 our findings seem to support the hypothesis that older females with knowledge of distant resources become crucial to the survival of herds during periods of extreme climatic events
3308252 climate change is expected to lead to a higher occurrence of severe drought in africa and our study suggests that such extreme climatic events may act as a selection force on animal populations as animals battle to cope certain individuals such as these grand dames of the elephant kingdom might become increasingly important
3308253 its enticing to think that these old females and their memories of previous periods of trauma and survival would have meant all the difference
3308254 the data seem to support the speculation that the matriarchs with the necessary experience of such events were able to lead their groups to drought refugia
3308255 hopefully this study underlines the importance of how crucial older matriarchs are to the health of elephant populations
3308256 protecting the leaders of elephant herds will be even more important in what may be an increase in droughts due to climate change
3308257 we know from many clinical studies of patients and their families that our cells can tolerate a rather large amount of mutant mitochondrial dna with no significant loss of function
3308258 these new clinical measurements have given direct evidence for the widespread incidence of pathogenic mitochondrial dna mutations in the human population these findings emphasize the pressing need to develop effective ways to interrupt the transmission of these mutations to the next generation

3308264 we believe this results marks the tipping point for hkex in terms of earnings progression the strong trading conditions that prevailed in the second half of 2007 were always going to provide a tough prior year comparative for hkex however this is expected to be compounded by the recent fading of trading activity

3308267 the positive sentiment seen at the end of first quarter 2008 that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived as trading conditions deteriorated significantly in the second half of may in particular for assets related to u s residential real estate as well as other structured credit positions
3308268 this occurred in the context of continuing credit market turbulence and its impact on the firms operating performance and reputation
3308269 the uncertain near term outlook for global financial markets and potential changes in regulatory capital requirements
3308270 our review has clearly revealed the weaknesses associated with the integrated one firm business model
3308271 some of these weaknesses such as the blurring of the true risk reward profile of individual businesses are the source of substantial risk as we have seen in the past few months

3308286 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3308287 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3308288 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3308289 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3308290 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3308291 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3308292 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3308293 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3308301 there has been a rapid increase in property values over the past 10 or 15 years but the increase over the past two years has levelled off people will now be closely watching waiting to see what the implications are for the sector
3308302 the market is two fold theres the industrial side motorways hotels and the like and theres the housing market where people are realising that if they landscape their garden their home sells better people in ireland have become a bit more educated in horticulture

3308313 i have your letter of september 29 asking for further documentation regarding a statement made in my book
3308314 repeated doses of infinitesimal amounts of fluoride will in time reduce an individuals power to resist domination by slowly poisoning and narcotizing a certain area of the brain thus making him submissive to the will of those who wish to govern him
3308315 the real reason behind water fluoridation is not to benefit childrens teeth if this were the real reason there are many ways in which it could be done that are much easier cheaper and far more effective the real purpose behind water fluoridation is to reduce the resistance of the masses to domination and control and loss of liberty
3308316 when the nazis under hitler decided to go to poland both the german general staff and the russian general staff exchanged scientific and military ideas plans and personnel and the scheme of mass control through water medication was seized upon by the russian communists because it fitted ideally into their plans to communize the world
3308317 i was told of this entire scheme by a german chemist who was an official of the great i g farben chemical industries and was also prominent in the nazi movement at the time i say this with all the earnestness and sincerity of a scientist who has spent nearly 20 years research into the chemistry biochemistry physiology and pathology of fluorine any person who drinks artificially fluorinated water for a period of one year or more will never again be the same person mentally or physically
3308318 it appears that the citizens of massachusetts are among the next on the agenda of the water poisoners
3308319 there is a sinister network of subversive agents godless intellectual parasites working in our country today whose ramifications grow more extensive more successful and more alarming each new year and whose true objective is to demoralize paralyze and destroy our great republic from within if they can according to their plan for their own possession
3308320 the tragic success they have already attained in their long siege to destroy the moral fiber of american life is now one of their most potent footholds towards their own ultimate victory over us
3308321 fluoridation of our community water systems can well become their most subtle weapon for our sure physical and mental deterioration as a research chemist of established standing i built within the past 22 years 3 american chemical plants and licensed 6 of my 53 patents based on my years of practical experience in the health food and chemical field let me warn fluoridation of drinking water is criminal insanity sure national suicide dont do it
3308322 even in very small quantities sodium fluoride is a deadly poison to which no effective antidote has been found every exterminator knows that it is the most effective rat killer sodium fluoride is entirely different from organic calcium fluoro phosphate needed by our bodies and provided by nature in gods great providence and love to build and strengthen our bones and our teeth this organic calcium fluoro phosphate derived from proper foods is an edible organic salt insoluble in water and assimilable by the human body whereas the non organic sodium fluoride used in fluoridating water is instant poison to the body and fully water soluble the body refuses to assimilate it
3308323 careful bonafide laboratory experimentation by conscientious patriotic research chemists and actual medical experience have both revealed that instead of preserving or promoting dental health fluoridated drinking water destroys teeth before adulthood and after by the destructive mottling and other pathological conditions it actually causes in them and also creates many other very grave pathological conditions in the internal organisms of bodies consuming it how then can it be called a health plan whats behind it
3308324 that any so called doctors would persuade a civilized nation to add voluntarily a deadly poison to its drinking water systems is unbelievable it is the height of criminal insanity
3308325 no wonder hitler and stalin fully believed and agreed from 1939 to 1941 that quoting from both lenins last will and hitlers mein kampf
3308326 are our civil defense organizations and agencies awake to the perils of water poisoning by fluoridation its use has been recorded in other countries sodium fluoride water solutions are the cheapest and most effective rat killers known to chemists colorless odorless tasteless no antidote no remedy no hope instant and complete extermination of rats
3308327 fluoridation of water systems can be slow national suicide or quick national liquidation it is criminal insanity treason
3308328 as an online discussion grows longer the probability of a comparison involving nazis or hitler approaches one

3308340 the risk of running out of money within 30 years of retirement climbs dramatically if you choose to retire at the beginning of a bear market
3308341 someone who retired in 2000 is in danger of running out of money
3308342 our recommendation is that when you have a bear market like this one and we dont see the light at the end of the tunnel yet it is not a good time to retire
3308343 your portfolio is already down so now you will start to withdraw from the portfolio you will just make a bad situation worse
3308344 the worst thing is not having the nest egg you want when you do retire that is incredibly disappointing get over this idea that you just cant work another day maybe you can change the kind of work you do so its refreshing and different but brings in some money

3308352 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3308353 the purpose of the operation has been achieved the security of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been restored
3308354 i dont think russia will feel like talking with mr saakashvili after what he did to our citizens
3308355 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3308356 the georgian people will never surrender freedom and democracy because democracy is stronger than any of their tanks any of their bombings any of their brutal equipment
3308357 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3308358 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses
3308359 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3308360 her story sparkles with wit and words i had to look up
3308361 all three generations of older adults the baby boomers not yet retired older adults who have retired in the last few years and the elderly many who can no longer get to the library

3308365 het idee voor fashionchick is ontstaan tijdens mijn scriptie er komen steeds meer webshops op de online markt maar hoe vind je deze op een leuke en interactieve manier ik wilde alles op een site zodat je niet het hele internet af hoeft te speuren naar leuke kleding schoenen of accessoires
3308366 je kunt op fashionchick een profiel aanmaken je vriendinnen uitnodigen en producten uit alle bekende en vertrouwde webshops bekijken daarna kun je deze producten in je kast hangen andere kledingkasten bekijken om inspiratie op te doen en kletsen in de het concept van fashionchick drijft op affiliate marketing dit is een vorm van online marketing waarbij de adverteerder de affiliate in dit geval fashionchick betaalt voor elke bezoeker lead of sale die hij genereert via zijn haar website s of zoekmachinecampagne beide partijen maken gebruik van affiliate netwerken die als intermediair fungeren en de vergoedingen berekenen en uitkeren

3308418 we are doing better than last year which is good news for us because we are a small group and depend on visitor figures
3308419 we have had a lot of grandparents coming in with their grandchildren more school groups people staying at home could be a factor
3308420 we have noticed fewer american tourists and that could be down to the mortgage crisis happening over there
3308421 we have done several tours now mainly british tourists people from the cambridge area as well as norfolk and northampton people to seem to be holidaying at home more this year and although its early days there is a definite demand for the tours
3308422 and they seem to be staying for longer instead of coming from friday to sunday they are here for five or six days
3308423 i think its the cost of petrol that does it and fewer people going abroad could be a factor too lots of people go to spain each year but the pound isnt very strong at the moment
3308424 we are getting more and more campers its to do with everything the credit crunch petrol and problems with the aeroplanes
3308425 the facilities on the campsites in the uk are very good now the only thing you cant guarantee is the weather
3308426 july was quiet and we were slightly down on last year but the weather is a big factor and people would have wanted to be outside
3308427 but the figures for the cathedral are up so people are still coming to ely
3308428 we have been extremely busy as most of our visitors are foreign
3308429 we are much busier than last year many people come to grantchester just for us
3308430 if some city attractions are doing well its possible that people are using the internet to decide what they would like to do before they come to cambridge instead of coming to us

3308465 no public health rationale for invoking criminal law sanctions against those who unintentionally transmit hiv or expose others to it
3308466 warranted only where someone sets out knowing he has hiv to infect another and succeeds
3308467 moved on from the fruitless debate between prevention and treatment that has plagued us in the past
3308468 f ailure to enact a comprehensive sustained and multipronged attack on the pandemic represents a crime against those infected those affected and those susceptible
3308469 have the structure and financial ability to take on all the people who require antiretroviral drugs and treat them for life
3308470 printed posters and postcards and created advertisements using photographs of prominent people above questions meant to challenge stereotypes
3308471 this is a 15 year scandal born of ignorance and inertia
3308472 we now know that millions of women might have been spared hiv unwanted pregnancies and empowered themselves in the process if they had access to this simple method
3308473 the female condom is 18 times more expensive than a male condom its obvious why women are not using it more
3308474 it is about the right for women to have access to protection and their right to make choices for themselves schools should be teaching boys and girls about the female condom but sadly most of them are not
3308475 the male condom was promoted so hard in advertising through school education n and advocacy we need the same effort for the female condom
3308476 its a partial answer but this is a way of helping particularly in settings where prevalence is so high
3308477 should not be seen as a specialist condition anymore this is a condition that needs to be managed in primary care as well as in specialist centers when required
3308478 they get holistic care at the local clinic level with people they know and were comfortable with
3308479 more people at the clinics expressed their confidence in the ability to start to manage their own conditions than the people who attended the hospitals with all their doctors and facilities
3308480 there was comparable level of quality of nurses and physicians in terms of hiv care and treatment
3308481 doctors are managers and see a lot of different types of patients n urses are more available and provide the bulk of care
3308482 half of the children born with hiv will die before they reach the age of two
3308483 these are extraordinary organizations helping to meet the needs of their own communities in often very difficult circumstances
3308484 have shown extraordinary creativity courage and leadership in responding to the epidemic and achieving tangible results with limited resources

3308491 in order to prevent the circumstances in which ukraine could be drawn into a military conflict ukraine reserves the right to bar ships which may take part in these actions from returning to the ukrainian territory until the conflict is solved
3308492 it makes a third party involved and its quite unexpected
3308493 stop the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace
3308494 we can hardly agree with this because it would assume the presence of people described as georgian peacekeepers
3308495 they can no longer remain they brought shame upon themselves as peacekeepers they committed crimes

3308509 we preach unto you that you should turn from these vanities unto the living god who made heaven earth sea and all things that are in them
3308510 god who made the world and everything in it since he is lord of heaven and earth now commands all men everywhere to repent because he has appointed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he has ordained
3308511 if theres a god why is there all the suffering in the world
3308512 for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory for ever amen
3308513 but because of his great love for us god who is rich in mercy made us alive with christ even when we were dead in transgressions it is by grace you have been saved and god raised us up with christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in christ jesus in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace expressed in his kindness to us in christ jesus

3308532 our supporters have already had a glimpse of steve in our pre season friendly against wigan athletic and im sure they will appreciate that he is a quick and exciting forward
3308533 we are delighted to have such a highly rated player at hibernian for the season
3308534 i dont regard it as a wasted year it was something i had to do i could not turn the opportunity down everyone i spoke to said to try it at chelsea
3308535 last year was great for me i have never regretted it it was a year money cannot buy with the experience i got and simply being with those players week in week out training and playing with them
3308536 how can you not improve when you are working alongside players such as frank lampard michael ballack and claude makelele whether i am a better player that will be shown this year obviously i did not play as many games as i would have liked and that is what i want now
3308537 i am sure marc crosas will be a star at celtic xavi enthused to the
3308538 the kid has the quality to achieve major success abroad
3308539 barca have many players in midfield and that makes it tough for the young players but i believe that he will return to the club after a big year at celtic
3308540 this is a kid with a winning mentality and great control of the ball crosas has perfect vision and an offensive game and he creates many chances for the strikers i believe that celtic have closed a perfect piece of business
3308541 all the midfield players who are at barca are compared to xavi or josep guardiola yet every player has different characteristics
3308542 i have to not show that i can be compared to those players but that i can play at a good level in my own right for celtic
3308543 im confident i can force my way into the managers plans
3308544 i spoke to sone at the weekend and he told me his decision
3308545 it is disappointing we have talked to him a few times over the summer and we were keen to have him back there was no problem with birmingham city or alex mcleish but sone felt he wanted to be closer to home and his family in england
3308546 regardless of what happens at the end of his first month at blackpool he cannot come here then the transfer window in scotland will be closed by then until january
3308547 sone hinted a couple of weeks ago that as much as he enjoyed it up here he would prefer to stay closer to home he said he really loved the time he spent here
3308548 it will not put us off looking at alternative loan signings and that is something we are working on
3308549 but i woke up this morning and i still felt this pain and so the decision was taken along with the doctors
3308550 unfortunately the tests took any hope away i will stay to watch the game against cameroon and then ill return to italy
3308551 its going to be a busy week the marlon king situation is ongoing and were still looking to strengthen
3308552 i do not want us to play in the uefa cup just so we can visit a few european places but so that we can achieve something this season
3308553 they are a good team and their last result a 3 0 defeat in the league is not a reflection of how good they are
3308554 of all the possibilities that we had i tink hajduk is one of the most difficult that we could have come up against because they are a famous side and because their league is strong
3308555 ill increase your income five fold your partners will love you your clients will respect you youll have four months of vacation each year and live to be 100 all i require in return is that your wifes soul your childrens souls and their childrens souls will burn in hell for eternity

3308557 when it comes to the challenges of ownership i think that decentralization of ec aid is an important factor decentralization to the delegations so that the dialogue can take place on a level where the partnership is taking place and that goes for all the member states but certainly for the governments and the civil society and that is something for what we have to work stronger for the decentralization of the delegations

3308565 consumerism like all addictions is a spiritual problem few people in their rational moments really believe that owning more things creates a greater sense of security all of us know that money is not a panacea for every ill we live in a culture that says that it is essential to look good feel good and make good it was eve the first consumer who fell for the lie that god was holding back from her something that was essential for her satisfaction

3308568 we had nothing to show for it early but everybody stayed at it it was a great atmosphere tonight was a fun game to play its better when you have the lead but it was well played we stayed at it and got a win
3308569 the good part of it was it was a 1 0 game you always feel like youre a hit or a walk away or like what happened tonight j d hits a ball in the gap and all of a sudden were winning

3308597 los prefectos que han sido ratificados por el voto popular deben dejar su tono de voz deben bajar su soberbia y deben buscar un di logo con el gobierno donde no salgan perdedores ninguna de las partes
3308598 el pueblo quiere paz y se deben deponer las actitudes contrarias a sta y sentarse a dialogar y alcanzar la concertaci n a trav s de un mecanismo que permita encontrar estas semejanzas porque sin duda hay m s afinidades que divergencias entre los bolivianos las cuales son m s que las diferencias pero stas deben ser rescatadas y buscadas con el di logo

3308617 of course this is not my full name but you would be slow asleep before i had completely introduced myself
3308618 the forest sings every day fairies come and tell me stories creatures come from all around to ask me for advice naturally as only an old tree like myself can provide it the seasons always change the stars are always different flowers are always growing
3308619 havent you ever wondered what was outside this forest bomodil
3308620 you used my name that means we are becoming friends
3308621 it must be strange to live as you do never seeing the world outside
3308622 there are just so many things to see out there
3308623 like the city havent you ever wanted to leave this forest
3308624 there is no horizon greater in width than the one that rests in our mind there is no mountain so tall that we cannot make one taller no valley so green that we could not make one greener no ocean or pond so deep or so wide that we couldnt make one that was fathomless
3308625 dreams are a wonderous thing no ghost or spirit could ever take them from us they are with us when we are born and they go with us when we die they are our hopes and our questions our answers and our prayers some of us are driven by our dreams some are thrown into dispair but my dreams guide me they lift me from my roots and they carry me to so so many places naturally
3308626 you noticed it too i didnt think it was worth mentioning
3308627 never bill even while i rest i can feel the wind blowing through my leaves
3308628 bill you should go run leave this forest escape i can not tell you what is coming but it cannot be good go
3308629 do you think we are not all afraid im a tree at least you can run
3308630 i will be alright bill do not worry about this old tree i will be alright
3308631 we are going to try a bunch of your ape recommendations today i love having
3308632 thank you mark i look forward to reading more of your columns in this
3308633 did i make a rabbit by expecting it not so i was not so primed
3308634 we find peace in the room and dont ask what wont be answered
3308635 some entity which mattered in its not probably mattering too much
3308636 devoid of any consequences each just itself for no purpose
3308637 everything is so evident there seems an awkwardness in adjusting to your contact with it
3308638 does not suit the prickliness and jumps and stiff surprises of the world outside
3308639 into each go foreigners from myself all couth all uncouth t ogether they seethe together to make up some of a man
3308640 nothing is less than particular and indeed nothing is less than particular
3308641 saw us on the same day its head tilting up staring with its black frontal pair of eyes
3308642 i in my straw hat he in his dance mask interested in each other and parting as equals without i trust a cloud of distress left behind the hedge
3308643 he has long seen it all and now grants it a showing without having to look he comes to the unmediated this and thus and has thrown out both hands
3308644 because i was there and because they have often played a part in my further thinking
3308645 during the last few times we hear it the sound does open up as if it were emerging
3308646 in an altogether different world of sound speed size purpose and agitation
3308647 n atural facts in their reality that i reach for
3308648 i am not entirely present as the person fingering it
3308649 may be just so many more observed facts that loneliness of all the facts
3308650 may be when something feels close in the way i am looking for one feels that some heed has been taken of it to hold it and keep it
3308651 and step inside this unexpectedly generous sameness perfect to an astonishment a gratitude the house here becomes in a moment something to count on
3308652 t here was some triumph in the mineral tang of their calls taps urgently delivered on the here and now their own warning of themselves and us so situated in the scrub and nothing more
3308653 the incongruities between objective depersonalised transcendent views of the state of things and the subjective self absorbed view which they belittle but which you need to keep close to hand
3308654 as if there were miles of available dappling below t he sense of an inexhaustible resource of excited various availability ready for the contentment of an enormous sigh of acceptance
3308655 sandeep never mentioned about work pressure the option of transfer to some other project available to any executive in the company was open to him
3308656 our work culture which revolves around good work life balance is our unique selling point usp

3308658 my friends son was working for big co a and moved to big co b in big co a he got 3 promotions in 2 years and then when he went to big co b he got another promotion with a 30 salary hike he was making 2 5lakhs when he joined big co a and now he is making 8 lakhs
3308659 my friends son was working for big co a and moved to big co b in big co a he got 3 promotions in 2 years and then when he went to big co b he got another promotion with a 30 salary hike he was making 2 5lakhs when he joined big co a and now he is making 8 lakhs
3308660 we are trained from childhood that saying no is a sign of disrespect
3308661 we are now waiting for him to wake up and speak so we can find out more details about what happened
3308662 it presents several new aspects which were not present in previous incidents in xinjiang
3308663 one is the sophisticated coordination of the attacks it was not just one attack its a string of bombings that requires much more planning and a larger organization to carry out especially at the time of the olympics when the security is so high
3308664 if you look at the streets everything seems calm and peaceful
3308665 but behind it all the situation is different people are really angry
3308666 if you are a muslim you are already a criminal suspect in the eyes of the chinese
3308667 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3308668 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3308669 wir gehen davon aus dass das umfeld f r die us wirtschaft und die weltwirtschaft schwach bleiben wird die kapitalm rkte werden kontinuierlich unter stress stehen der fall der hauspreise in den vereinigten staaten wird sich fortsetzen
3308670 diese faktoren haben das ergebnis bereits belastet und werden das auch weiter tun
3308671 politicians fear that they will lose control with e government and this is coming in the way of successful implementation of e government projects in india
3308672 both the central and state governments have followed a silo approach to e government some implementation has taken place but it has tended to be piecemeal and disjointed thereby having little impact
3308673 the biggest challenge before e government is not technology but change management
3308674 we have done considerable work on e government for countries like bahrain
3308675 india on the other hand has set no such targets
3308676 out of the 27 projects under the negp only one the mca21 program has been completed there is tremendous gap between conceptualization and implementation
3308677 we have successfully implemented plenty of e government programs across the world and have worked with numerous governments the world over but in india the government still doesnt want to lose control
3308678 india also needs to measure the outcome of e government initiatives it is one thing to fix service levels and state that we are spending so much money on e government but quite another thing to measure outcomes
3308679 for instance india could set a target that the government will have 300 services online by 2010 after that we should set up a proper mechanism to monitor the process
3308680 the government must not own the hardware technology changes so fast that governments would do best to outsource their hardware needs by entering into the right kind of ppps
3308681 governments are increasingly adopting technology and escalating their spend on it thereby ensuring faster and robust flow of information more efficient processes and reliable and cost effective services
3308682 the implementation of swans will bring about a tectonic shift since every state will turn to a wide area network
3308683 since indias per capita public sector it spend is very low at us 1 29 there is tremendous potential for e government to benefit citizens exponentially and for central and local governments to maximize returns on their investments
3308684 in the past the governments spends on e government initiatives have been recovered in less than a year
3308685 no one device offers the depth and breadth of entertainment that xbox 360 can deliver and we know consumers need increasingly more and more space to store the amazing digital entertainment content we provide
3308686 now the xbox 360 has triple the space to house all your entertainment needs at no extra cost
3308687 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3308688 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3308689 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3308690 the advance casts doubts on russias claim that this five day war is just a peacekeeping operation
3308691 this war is all about russia and the message russias sending to the world this is putins announcement that russia is back as a great power
3308692 we have to understand these russian troops didnt materialize out of nowhere
3308693 this is the culmination of putins efforts to pull georgia back within russias sphere and exert control over it
3308694 i am getting a little bit sick and tired of what were seeing a battle of words from left and right
3308695 i felt so good pulling on the costume for the first time so confident and in control i really felt like an action heroine

3308699 i can understand that youre upset that this wasnt as big of a surprise as you and other people on this board anticipated you know theres that saying that you cant please everyone so does that mean we shouldnt try to give ps fans anything street fighter alpha is a start
3308700 grant hinted there was more street fighter goodness to come you know what both grant and i came from sony as game testers we still have a lot of friends over there and at microsoft as well and we have no reason to give ps fans the shaft just know that there are things we cant talk about at this point and that were making an effort again this is the first of many things to come and we appreciate all you capcom fans who continue to support us for those weve lost along the way we havent forgot about you and continue to listen to your feedback as long as its constructive so go to our forums tell us what you want were listening

3308724 ik heb heel graag controle over dingen dan is ms wel een onhandige ziekte om te hebben
3308725 ik dacht hoe krijg ik mensen zo ver dat ze op een losse manier bewust met die handicap bezig zijn
3308726 uiterlijk is iets waarmee je dingen bereikt je kunt laten zien dat je net zo mooi en slim kunt zijn als ieder ander
3308727 daar moet iets tegenover staan programmas die tonen wat we wel kunnen en dat we kunnen meedraaien in de maatschappij
3308728 wij zouden niet boos moeten worden we moeten juist gebruik maken van de hulp en interesse je kan vrij snel aangeven dat je iets zelf kan de mensen doen het niet uit kwaadwillendheid
3308729 wie er ook wint blijf in de wereld van de mensen zonder handicap hen moet je vertellen wat er anders moet
3308730 the amazon software en espanol store introduces a more personalized customer experience that will provide millions of consumers with access to a wide selection of software products in spanish
3308731 we continue to remain committed to our customers by not only striving to provide the best prices selection and convenience but by also helping them to easily discover new products
3308732 ik ben namelijk normaal helemaal niet met mijn handicap bezig ik denk vooral aan mijn studie en de muur die in een andere kleur geverfd moet worden dan word ik s ochtends wakker en denk ik ik ga joggen maar dat kan ik helemaal niet
3308733 mijn man vindt dat ik er leuk uit zie en zei dat ik me op moest geven
3308734 een handicap kan samengaan met schoonheid hoewel ik eigenlijk niet op mijn uiterlijk beoordeeld wil worden zie ik het als middel om mijn doel te bereiken het lijkt me geweldig om ambassadeur te zijn voor mensen met een handicap en ik denk dat ik dat heel goed kan het is zo jammer dat iedereen op elkaar wil lijken
3308735 op mijn zeventiende toen woonden we net in doesburg voelde ik me ziek grieperig en eigenlijk ben ik nooit meer beter geworden
3308736 op school daar ging ik snel weer naar toe werd het goed opgepakt ik kon gespreid examen doen en ik hoefde niet bij alle lessen aanwezig te zijn
3308737 opeens wilde mijn been tijdens ballet niet meet omhoog ik heb toen een mri scan gehad en daaruit bleek dat ik relapsing remitting ms heb
3308738 maar dat komt niet omdat er iets mis is met mijn benen of spieren in mijn hersenen ontstaan ontstekingen die ervoor zorgen dat de signalen die de hersenen aan de rest van het lichaam geeft niet doorkomen
3308739 ik heb het geluk dat ik heel veel dingen leuk vind gaat het ene niet meer dan doe ik gewoon iets anders zo zit ik nu op argentijnse tangoles met mijn man die vindt het verschrikkelijk maar ik vind het fantastisch bovendien kan ik daardoor mijn lopen verbeteren een voordeel is er wel stofzuigen kan ik niet meer
3308740 mensen zien niet hoeveel moeite wij hebben met werk vinden in winkels en in treinen komen mijn familie en vrienden weten hoe irritant bruggetjes en kinderkopjes voor rolstoelgebruikers zijn maar we zijn niet zichtbaar genoeg waarom spelen er geen mensen met een handicap in goede tijden slechte tijden dat zou geweldig zijn
3308741 mijn leven is volledig veranderd door het ambassadeurschap ik heb ervoor gezorgd dat mensen met een handicap meer in de publiciteit komen zo heb ik een kalender gemaakt met twaalf vrouwen die een lichamelijke beperking hebben ook heb ik me hard gemaakt voor betere toegankelijkheid van het openbaar vervoer
3308742 hou helder voor ogen wat je wilt veranderen waarom je dat wilt veranderen en hoe je dat gaat veranderen
3308743 what i told them was now no one has any excuses i eliminated all excuses
3308744 ruud was their guy so ruud resigning and us accepting that obviously is not a great day for them
3308745 so those who claim there was influence this was my decision solely
3308746 i dont think david knew about this decision until the team meeting i saw him right before i went in the locker room and i dont even think he knew what i was about to do

3309032 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3309033 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3309034 it is sad to witness the ulster unionist party abandoning this valued and much loved part of our community as they rush to embrace an anti orange agenda

3309061 satellites cant see the ocean through the ice and the profiling floats we are using throughout the worlds oceans now are also unable to surface through the ice and transmit their data by satellite
3309062 the sea ice is important for climate because it is bright and reflects the suns energy back into
3309063 weve never been able to measure how much sea ice is actually forming before and the seal data is allowing us to do that for the first time
3309064 we will be instrumenting a total of about 160 seals both in the arctic and antarctic using several different species of seal because different seals go to different places to feed so we can get information from different parts of the ocean

3309175 i dont see myself ageing i am still competitive and really enjoying it my age has nothing to do with how i play or my attitude
3309176 i am still passionate about the sport i prepare for every match as best i can and a defeat still hurts me as much as it used to i still celebrate every victory as much as i used to when i was in my 20s and it is all because i am thoroughly enjoying the game

3309191 i have decided to postpone the opening of the elliot in manchester as i do not believe now is a good time for a high end restaurant opening and there is more demand for olive press at the present time

3309193 weve been experiencing tremendous growth and are growing significantly this year
3309194 weve been adding exchange servers to cope with email proliferation tacking on more every year because of the large amount of historical data we need to access we knew that quotas wouldnt be a good fit for us we needed a better more long term approach to dealing with the explosion of email following an roi analysis we determined that deploying mimosa nearpoint would enable us to remove mailbox quotas and receive rapid roi
3309195 mimosa nearpoint has the capability to scale seamlessly as we grow we expect to see continued growth in the future so we needed a long term solution that would scale with us
3309196 with mimosas content archiving solution in place foxwoods will eliminate email quotas while centrally managing retention policy for email communication which is critical to a fast growing organization like foxwoods
3309197 permabit developed core technology and filed these patents more than eight years ago long before deduplication of data in storage systems was widely understood to be critical to the future of large scale data storage
3309198 we realized early on the importance of using advanced technology to shrink the storage footprint and thus reduce the cost of archive data weve implemented this deduplication technology in a product that is second to none in its ability to scale in capacity and reliabily protect and cost effectively maintain data for large enterprises over the long term
3309199 this decision is not expected to impact 2008 forecast production as there is sufficient stockpiled ore to feed the hms heavy media separation processing plant through to the end of the year and achieve 9000 tonnes of copper production for 2008
3309200 we have found a huge lack of awareness among consumers who think its normal for their dryer to take two to three cycles to dry one load of clothing and dont realize this is a vent clog warning sign and fire hazard
3309201 dont let your dryer start a fire keep your home safe and sound
3309202 when a consumer finds their dryer taking multiple cycles to dry clothes or if it keeps stopping during a cycle the cause could be lint accumulation in the vent line causing the dryer to work inefficiently or not at all
3309203 annual maintenance can mean lower energy bills when the dryer is working efficiently in addition clothes dont wear out as quickly when they dont have to go through multiple cycles
3309204 time is a precious commodity for most people today busy households have an urgent need to get their dryers up and running safely and efficiently this is why they call dryer vent wizard to help them obtain a quick solution to their dryer vent problems

3309216 many people think it is normal for a dryer to take two to three cycles to get clothing completely dry
3309217 i found dvw provided much needed solutions to consumers dryer and dryer vent problems
3309218 when consumers find their dryer taking more than one cycle to dry a load they assume its mechanical when the real problem is lint accumulation in the dryer vent causing the dryer to work inefficiently and become susceptible to a dryer fire

3309221 it is staggering that lenny harper and his colleagues both on jersey and the mainland have been able to collate so much evidence in this case i know from my own experience this must have been a painstaking task and all those involved in the investigation are to be applauded
3309222 it is emerging from the evidence given by the alleged victims who have come forward and from the forensic aspect of the enquiry that haut de la garenne was a scene of unparalleled child abuse atrocities even if the children whose remains have been found were not the victims of homicide the fact that they were not given a religious burial let alone any kind of dignity demonstrates that by entering the home you actually became a lesser human being as those who are still alive allege
3309223 it must surely be the wish of all those who have any interest in ensuring that the full truth emerges they fully support the ongoing police investigation and this must also mean that all assistance that is required is provided
3309224 the victims both those who are no longer with us and those still alive deserve nothing less in representing my clients i shall be continuing to observe the investigation with acute interest
3309225 for years i suffered with a chronic condition known as irritable bowel syndrome ibs doctors and medications failed but eliminating a few foods and additives from my diet completely solved the problem as a result i became an avid reader of packaged food labels this was time consuming confusing and often misleading i looked for an easier solution but none existed thats when the idea for labelwatch was conceived
3309226 anyone interested in what theyre putting in their or their body pregnant women health conscious mothers and of course anyone with some type of food allergy autoimmune disease or any kind of health concern in fact weve had a huge outpouring of support from the health amp wellness community dietitians physicians fitness trainers and non profit health organizations all see labelwatch as a critical tool they can incorporate into their professional practice

3309323 i knew your mother did you know that i knew her real good i took her from behind by that creek over there
3309324 i have seen old donkeys better suited to be a husband
3309325 now you have your own idiot child to do all your smiling for you
3309326 i see youve confused what youre learning in school with actual education
3309327 but if what he said is true then does it make you a sinner baba
3309328 do you want to know what your father thinks about sin
3309329 but first understand this and understand it now amir youll never learn anything of value from those bearded idiots
3309330 i mean all of them piss on the beards of all those self righteous monkeys
3309331 they do nothing but thumb their prayer beads and recite a book written in a tongue they dont even understand
3309332 god help us all if afghanistan ever falls into their hands
3309333 but enough about that you asked about sin and i want to tell you are you listening
3309334 i mean to speak to you man to man do you think you can handle that for once
3309335 now no matter what the mullah teaches there is only one sin only one and that is theft every other sin is a variation of theft do you understand that
3309336 you steal his wifes right to a husband rob his children of a father when you tell a lie you steal someones right to the truth when you cheat you steal the right to fairness do you see
3309337 a man who takes whats not his to take be it a life or a loaf of naan i spit on such a man and if i ever cross paths with him god help him do you understand
3309338 if theres a god out there then i would hope he has more important things to attend to than my drinking scotch or eating pork now hop down all this talk about sin has made me thirsty again
3309339 amir do you see that man sitting up there with those other men around him
3309340 i know i know but hes always buried in those books or shuffling around the house like hes lost in some dream

3309342 i wasnt like that at all and neither were any of the kids i grew up with
3309343 you know sometimes you are the most self centered man i know
3309344 sometimes i look out this window and i see him playing on the street with the neighborhood boys
3309345 thats not what i mean rahim and you know it
3309346 self defense has nothing to do with meanness you know what always happens when the neighborhood boys tease him hassan steps in and fends them off ive seen it with my own eyes and when they come home i say to him how did hassan get that scrape on his face and he says he fell down im telling you rahim there is something missing in that boy

3309389 i think maybe youll win the tournament this year what do you think
3309390 but better to get hurt by the truth than comforted with a lie
3309391 sure and not the black and white kind either well probably be grown ups by then but ill get us two one for you and one for me
3309392 ill put it on my table where i keep my drawings
3309393 you know i think youre going to make agha sahib very proud tomorrow
3309394 we were at ghargha lake you me father agha sahib rahim khan and thousands of other people
3309395 it was warm and sunny and the lake was clear like a mirror but no one was swimming because they said a monster had come to the lake it was swimming at the bottom waiting
3309396 so everyone is scared to get in the water and suddenly you kick off your shoes amir agha and take off your shirt theres no monster you say ill show you all and before anyone can stop you you dive into the water start swimming away i follow you in and were both swimming
3309397 its a dream amir agha you can do anything anyway everyone is screaming get out get out but we just swim in the cold water we make it way out to the middle of the lake and we stop swimming we turn toward the shore and wave to the people they look small like ants but we can hear them clapping they see now there is no monster just water they change the name of the lake after that and call it the lake of amir and hassan sultans of kabul and we get to charge people money for swimming in it
3309398 i dont know i was hoping you could tell me
3309399 im not sure i want to fly a kite today
3309400 remember amir agha theres no monster just a beautiful day
3309401 inshallah well celebrate later right now im going to run that blue kite for you
3309402 although ive always wondered how he manages i mean with those tight little eyes how does he see anything
3309403 what is a boy like you doing here at this time of the day looking for a hazara
3309404 he is lucky hazara having such a concerned master his father should get on his knees sweep the dust at your feet with his eyelashes
3309405 i think i saw the boy you described running that way he had a kite in his hand a blue one
3309406 what was it you said theyll have to call you one eyed assef thats right one eyed assef that was clever really clever then again its easy to be clever when youre holding a loaded weapon
3309407 im in a mood to forgive what do you say to that boys
3309408 especially after the rude manners he showed us last time
3309409 of course nothing is free in this world and my pardon comes with a small price
3309410 because today its only going to cost you that blue kite a fair deal boys isnt it
3309411 amir agha won the tournament and i ran this kite for him i ran it fairly this is his kite
3309412 but before you sacrifice yourself for him think about this would he do the same for you have you ever wondered why he never includes you in games when he has guests why he only plays with you when no one else is around ill tell you why hazara because to him youre nothing but an ugly pet something he can play with when hes bored something he can kick when hes angry dont ever fool yourself and think youre something more
3309413 you pathetic fool someday youll wake up from your little fantasy and learn just how good of a friend he is now bas enough of this give us that kite
3309414 im letting you keep the kite hazara ill let you keep it so it will always remind you of what im about to do
3309415 a rupia each children just one rupia each and i will part the curtain of truth
3309416 not much to ask for the truth is it a rupia each
3309417 and theres nothing sinful about teaching a lesson to a disrespectful donkey
3309418 all i want you weaklings to do is hold him down can you manage that
3309419 lately it seems all he wants to do is sleep he does his chores i see to that but then he just wants to crawl under his blanket can i ask you something
3309420 after that kite tournament he came home a little bloodied and his shirt was torn i asked him what had happened and he said it was nothing that hed gotten into a little scuffle with some kids over the kite
3309421 did something happen to him amir agha something hes not telling me
3309422 you would tell me nay inshallah you would tell me if some thing had happened
3309423 like i said how should i know whats wrong with him
3309424 maybe hes sick people get sick all the time ali now am i going to freeze to death or are you planning on lighting the stove today
3309425 do you want to ask hassan to come along to jalalabad
3309426 hes got a cold or something ali says hes sleeping it off
3309427 i havent seen much of hassan the last few days
3309428 too bad about hassan i thought you might have had more fun if he came
3309429 there must have been a hundred kites in the sky that day
3309430 a hundred kites homayoun jan no laaf and the only one still flying at the end of the day was amirs he has the last kite at home a beautiful blue kite hassan and amir ran it together
3309431 wah wah amir jan were all so proud of you
3309432 pull over kaka his face is yellow i dont want him throwing up on my new dress
3309433 i was wondering if you if you wanted to come along

3309435 ill tell you what i want you to stop doing
3309436 i want you to stop harassing me i want you to go away
3309437 baba have you ever thought about get ting new servants

3309439 my father took him in he loved ali like his own son forty years alis been with my family forty goddamn years and you think im just going to throw him out
3309440 ive never laid a hand on you amir but you ever say that again
3309441 you bring me shame and hassan hassans not going anywhere do you understand
3309442 hes staying right here with us where he belongs this is his home and were his family dont you ever ask me that question again
3309443 what would you do if i hit you with this

3309449 were thinking about playing a little game of volleyball tomorrow at my house
3309450 maybe youll join us bring hassan if you want to
3309451 but you have an open invitation amir jan anyway i heard you like to read so i brought you a book one of my favorites
3309452 arent you going to thank assef jan that was very considerate of him
3309453 did i ever tell you i was almost married once
3309454 its true i was eighteen her name was homaira she was a hazara the daughter of our neighbors servants she was as beautiful as a pari light brown hair big hazel eyes she had this laugh i can still hear it sometimes
3309455 we used to meet secretly in my fathers apple orchards always after midnight when everyone had gone to sleep wed walk under the trees and id hold her hand am i embarrassing you amir jan
3309456 you should have seen the look on my fathers face when i told him my mother actually fainted my sisters splashed her face with water they fanned her and looked at me as if i had slit her throat my brother jalal actually went to fetch his hunting rifle before my father stopped him
3309457 it was homaira and me against the world and ill tell you this amir jan in the end the world always wins thats just the way of things
3309458 that same day my father put homaira and her family on a lorry and sent them off to hazarajat i never saw her again
3309459 she would have suffered my family would have never accepted her as an equal you dont order someone to polish your shoes one day and call them sister the next
3309460 you know you can tell me anything you want amir jan anytime
3309461 the opportunity never presented itself last night for hassan and me to give you this
3309462 its modest and not worthy of you amir agha but we hope you like it still happy birthday
3309463 hassan said your copy was old and ragged and that some of the pages were missing
3309464 all the pictures are hand drawn in this one with pen and ink
3309465 were all going to sit down and settle this thing
3309466 did you steal that money did you steal amirs watch hassan
3309467 life here is impossible for us now agha sahib were leaving
3309468 i dont understand why youre doing this what do you mean impossible
3309469 im sorry agha sahib but our bags are already packed we have made our decision
3309470 ali havent i provided well for you havent i been good to you and hassan youre the brother i never had ali you know that please dont do this
3309471 dont make this even more difficult than it already is agha sahib
3309472 yes will you take us to the bus station agha sahib
3309473 but weve paid a fair price already hes getting paid good money
3309474 he says this is war there is no shame in war
3309475 tell him hes wrong war doesnt negate decency it demands it even more than in times of peace
3309476 these roussi are not like us they understand nothing about respect honor
3309477 he says hell enjoy putting a bullet in you almost as much as
3309478 tell him ill take a thousand of his bullets before i let this indecency take place
3309479 tell him hed better kill me good with that first shot because if i dont go down im tearing him to pieces goddamn his father
3309480 but they are just boys and when they come here they find the pleasure of drug
3309481 if you knew this why did you bring us here
3309482 because he got paid for his leg of the trip thats all he cared about
3309483 i thought you said the truck broke down last week
3309484 god is going to save us all why dont you pray to him
3309485 whatll save us is eight cylinders and a good carburetor
3309486 karim says he will call for a bus to take us to peshawar
3309487 there are only three real men in this world amir
3309488 then do something about it take action youre arabs help the palestinians then
3309489 brezhnev is massacring afghans and all that peanut eater can say is i wont come swim in your pool
3309490 hes not fit to run this country its like putting a boy who cant ride a bike behind the wheel of a brand new cadillac
3309491 maybe ill spell cat and the teacher will give me a glittery little star so i can run home and show it off to you
3309492 almost two years weve bought his damn fruits and put money in his pocket and the son of a dog wants to see my license
3309493 youre nice young man but your father hes crazy not welcome anymore
3309494 what kind of a country is this no one trusts anybody

3309503 and what will you do while you wait to get good and get discovered how will you earn money if you marry how will you support your khanum
3309504 wah wah so if i understand youll study several years to earn a degree then youll get a chatti job like mine one you could just as easily land today on the small chance that your degree might someday help you get discovered
3309505 this is general sahib mr iqbal taheri he was a decorated general in kabul he worked for the ministry of defense
3309506 he has finished his first year of college and earned as in all of his courses
3309507 will you be writing about our country history perhaps economics
3309508 well people need stories to divert them at difficult times like this
3309509 speaking of stories your father and i hunted pheasant together one summer day in jalalabad
3309510 it was a marvelous time if i recall correctly your fathers eye proved as keen in the hunt as it had in business
3309511 we afghans are prone to a considerable degree of exaggeration bachem and i have heard many men foolishly labeled great but your father has the distinction of belonging to the minority who truly deserves the label
3309512 boys and girls must know the legacy of their fathers
3309513 do you appreciate your father bachem do you really appreciate him
3309514 then congratulations you are already halfway to being a man
3309515 all ive heard is that there was a man once and things didnt go well
3309516 i hear she is a decent girl hardworking and kind but no khastegars no suitors have knocked on the generals door since
3309517 it may be unfair but what happens in a few days sometimes even a single day can change the course of a whole lifetime amir
3309518 i am not an ahmaq so dont play stupid with me
3309519 the man is a pashtun to the root he has nang and namoos
3309520 im sorry to be mozahem i didnt mean to disturb you
3309521 will you tell him i stopped by to pay my respects
3309522 oh and my name is amir in case you need to know so you can tell him that i stopped by to pay my respects
3309523 you know your grandfather ghazi sahib the judge now his uncle and my grandfather were cousins
3309524 soraya get him a chair hachem and wash one of those peaches theyre sweet and fresh
3309525 carry my salaam to your father and come back to see us again
3309526 ive always wanted to when we lived in virginia i became esl certified and now i teach at the public library one night a week my mother was a teacher too she taught farsi and history at zarghoona high school for girls in kabul
3309527 well when i was in fourth grade in kabul my father hired a woman named ziba to help around the house
3309528 anyway within a year ziba could read childrens books we sat in the yard and she read me the tales of dara and sara slowly but correctly she started calling me moalem soraya teacher soraya
3309529 i know it sounds childish but the first time ziba wrote her own letter i knew there was nothing else id ever want to be but a teacher i was so proud of her and i felt id done something really worthwhile you know
3309530 my father wants me to go to law school my mothers always throwing hints about medical school but im going to be a teacher doesnt pay much here but its what i want
3309531 they say it will rain this week hard to believe isnt it
3309532 you know bachem i have grown rather fond of you
3309533 even decent boys need reminding sometimes so its my duty to remind you that you are among peers in this flea market
3309534 hes got a spot on his right lung i want them to check it out
3309535 not really need a cat scan first then see the lung doctor
3309536 baba i read dr schneiders biography in the waiting room he was born in michigan michigan hes american a lot more american than you and i will ever be
3309537 his parents were roussi his grandparents were roussi i swear on your mothers face ill break his arm if he tries to touch me
3309538 dr schneiders parents fled from shorawi dont you see they escaped
3309539 it means it wouldnt change the outcome just prolong it
3309540 thats a clear answer dr amani thank you for that
3309541 dont you challenge me in public amir ever who do you think you are
3309542 what about me baba what am i supposed to do
3309543 whats going to happen to you you say all those years thats what i was trying to teach you how to never have to ask that question
3309544 and one more thing no one finds out about this you hear me no one i dont want anybodys sympathy
3309545 i want to go over your fathers cat scans with you
3309546 hell have to take steroids to reduce the swelling in his brain and antiseizure medications and id recommend palliative radiation do you know what that means
3309547 i have to go but you can have me paged if you have any questions
3309548 no burden at all more importantly do you need anything
3309549 anything at all ask me like youd ask a brother
3309550 we all knew something was wrong but we had no idea it was this
3309551 youd better go back inside or your father will come after me
3309552 im happy you came it means the world to me
3309553 then i wonder if youll do something for me if youre not too exhausted
3309554 i want you to go khastegari i want you to ask general taheri for his daughters hand
3309555 much better thank you it was so gracious of you to come
3309556 general sahib salaam alaykum yes much much better balay youre so kind general sahib im calling to ask if i may pay you and khanum taheri a visit tomorrow morning its an honorable matter yes eleven oclock is just fine until then khoda h fez
3309557 yes but soraya jan is upstairs in her room she wants to talk to you first
3309558 im happy too amir i cant believe this is happening
3309559 you need to know i dont want us to start with secrets and id rather you hear it from me
3309560 if it will make you feel better tell me but it wont change anything
3309561 when we lived in virginia i ran away with an afghan man i was eighteen at the time rebellious stupid and he was into drugs we lived together for almost a month all the afghans in virginia were talking about it
3309562 padar eventually found us he showed up at the door and made me come home i was hysterical yelling screaming saying i hated him
3309563 when i came home i saw my mother had had a stroke the right side of her face was paralyzed and i felt so guilty she didnt deserve that
3309564 weve always had our differences we still do but im grateful he came for me that day i really believe he saved me
3309565 nothing you said changes anything i want us to marry
3309566 thank you baba are you all right do you feel up to this
3309567 up to this its the happiest day of my life amir
3309568 youre barely in the house and im crying already amir jan
3309569 now this is the right way the afghan way to do it bachem
3309570 general sahib khanum jamila jan its with great humility that my son and i have come to your home today you are honorable people from distinguished and reputable families and proud lineage i come with nothing but the utmost ihtiram and the highest regards for you your family names and the memory of your ancestors
3309571 amirjan is my only son my only child and he has been a good son to me i hope he proves worthy of your kindness i ask that you honor amir jan and me and accept my son into your family
3309572 we are honored to welcome the son of a man such as yourself into our family
3309573 your reputation precedes you i was your humble admirer in kabul and remain so today we are honored that your family and ours will be joined
3309574 amirjan as for you i welcome you to my home as a son as the husband of my daughter who is the noor of my eye your pain will be our pain your joy our joy i hope that you will come to see your khala jamila and me as a second set of parents and i pray for your and our lovely soraya jans happiness you both have our blessings
3309575 i thought you might want us to have our own place
3309576 i put her up to it i hope you dont mind
3309577 ill come back with your morphine and a glass of water kaka jan
3309578 no one else to turn to and he lent me
3309579 i know it sounds crazy but i find myself wondering what his favorite qurma will be or his favorite subject in school
3309580 well hes going to stir the pot for us hell call some of his ins buddies
3309581 ill skip school tomorrow and take you to the doctor
3309582 then you might as well turn in your books for good bachem your khalas medical charts are like the works of rumi they come in volumes
3309583 i know i tell you that boy did well not to marry his cousin
3309584 their sons go out to nightclubs looking for meat and get their girlfriends pregnant they have kids out of wedlock and no one says a goddamn thing oh theyre just men having fun i make one mistake and suddenly everyone is talking nang and namoos and i have to have my face rubbed in it for the rest of my life
3309585 but my father showed up with a gun that night he told him that he had two bullets in the chamber one for him and one for himself if i didnt come home i was screaming calling my father all kinds of names saying he couldnt keep me locked up forever that i wished he were dead
3309586 i actually said that to him that i wished he were dead
3309587 when he brought me home my mother threw her arms around me and she was crying too
3309588 i didnt step out of the house for weeks and when i did i heard whispers or imagined them everywhere i went that was four years ago and three thousand miles away and im still hearing them
3309589 when i told you about this on the phone the night of khastegari i was sure youd change your mind
3309590 im so lucky to have found you youre so different from every afghan guy ive met
3309591 i dont know why youre wasting your talents like this
3309592 did you know amir jan that she earned nothing but as in high school
3309593 an intelligent girl like you could become a lawyer a political scientist and inshallah when afghanistan is free you could help write the new constitution there would be a need for young talented afghans like you they might even offer you a ministry position given your family name
3309594 im not a girl padar im a married woman besides theyd need teachers too
3309595 so he can boast about his attorney daughter to his friends another medal for the general
3309596 at least im not like him sitting around while other people fight the shorawi waiting for when the dust settles so he can move in and reclaim his posh little government position teaching may not pay much but its what i want to do its what i love and its a whole lot better than collecting welfare by the way
3309597 if he ever hears you saying that he will never speak to you again
3309598 just do zakat give the money to someone in need okay no sheep killing
3309599 but just because i have an agent doesnt mean ill get published if martin sells the novel then well celebrate
3309600 when am i going to sing alahoo for my little nawasa
3309601 a mans plumbing is like his mind simple very few surprises you ladies on the other hand well god put a lot of thought into making you
3309602 god knows best bachem maybe it wasnt meant to be
3309603 but i cant help it ive always dreamed that id hold it in my arms and know my blood had fed it for nine months that id look in its eyes one day and be startled to see you or me that the baby would grow up and have your smile or mine without that is that wrong
3309604 if were going to do it we shouldnt have any doubts at all about it and we should both be in agreement it wouldnt be fair to the baby otherwise
3309605 bachem this adoption thing im not so sure its for us afghans
3309606 for one thing they grow up and want to know who their natural parents are
3309607 nor can you blame them sometimes they leave the home in which you labored for years to provide for them so they can find the people who gave them life blood is a powerful thing bachem never forget that
3309608 now if you were american it wouldnt matter people here marry for love family name and ancestry never even come into the equation they adopt that way too as long as the baby is healthy everyone is happy but we are afghans bachem
3309609 just be happy you have your health and a good husband
3309610 when i was a kid he was the first grown up i ever thought of as a friend
3309611 wont be long madarjan a week maybe two yes you and padar can stay with me
3309612 it sounded like a jaroo a broomstick snapping in half
3309613 but then they had never seen afghan kidneys had they
3309614 many of your brothers in this area yar they are opening businesses but most of them are very poor
3309615 its not difficult to find people in america i bought a map of the u s and called up information for cities in northern california
3309616 its wonderfully strange to see you as a grown man
3309617 baba didnt get the chance to tell you but i got married fifteen years ago
3309618 i knew sharif jan in kabul long time ago before he moved to america
3309619 hes been working for the ins for years handles a lot of afghan cases
3309620 i was at a soccer game in ghazi stadium in 1998 kabul against mazar i sharif i think and by the way the players werent allowed to wear shorts indecent exposure i guess
3309621 anyway kabul scored a goal and the man next to me cheered loudly suddenly this young bearded fellow who was patrolling the aisles eighteen years old at most by the look of him he walked up to me and struck me on the forehead with the butt of his kalashnikov do that again and ill cut out your tongue you old donkey he said
3309622 i was old enough to be his grandfather and i was sitting there blood gushing down my face apologizing to that son of a dog
3309623 if you went from the shar e nau section to kerteh parwan to buy a carpet you risked getting shot by a sniper or getting blown up by a rocket if you got past all the checkpoints that was you practically needed a visa to go from one neighborhood to the other so people just stayed put prayed the next rocket wouldnt hit their home
3309624 remember the street that went from your house to the qishla the military bar racks next to istiqial school
3309625 when the taliban rolled in and kicked the alliance out of kabul i actually danced on that street
3309626 and believe me i wasnt alone people were celebrating at chaman at deh mazang greeting the taliban in the streets climbing their tanks and posing for pictures with them people were so tired of the constant fighting tired of the rockets the gunfire the explosions tired of watching gulbuddin and his cohorts firing on any thing that moved the alliance did more damage to kabul than the shorawi they destroyed your fathers orphanage did you know that
3309627 you dont want to know amir jan what it was like sifting through the rubble of that orphanage
3309628 yes hope is a strange thing peace at last but at what price
3309629 i dont think ill see the end of this summer
3309630 i see america has infused you with the optimism that has made her so great thats very good were a melancholic people we afghans arent we often we wallow too much in ghamkhori and self pity we give in to loss to suffering accept it as a fact of life even see it as necessary zendagi migzara we say life goes on but i am not surrendering to fate here i am being pragmatic i have seen several good doctors here and they have given the same answer i trust them and believe them there is such a thing as gods will
3309631 there is only what you do and what you dont do
3309632 you sounded like your father just now i miss him so much but it is gods will amir jan it really is
3309633 besides theres another reason i asked you to come here i wanted to see you before i go yes but something else too
3309634 you know all those years i lived in your fathers house after you left
3309635 i wasnt alone for all of them hassan lived there with me
3309636 i thought about writing you and telling you before but i wasnt sure you wanted to know was i wrong
3309637 i brought you here because i am going to ask something of you im going to ask you to do something for me but before i do i want to tell you about hassan do you understand
3309638 i want to tell you about him i want to tell you everything you will listen
3309639 i am praying for a boy to carry on my fathers name
3309640 and bamiyan is so close we know people there forgive me rahim khan i pray you understand
3309641 you were right hassan jan you have a zendagi a life here it was presumptuous of me to just show up and ask you to drop everything it is me who needs to be forgiven
3309642 well go with you well help you take care of the house
3309643 agha sahib was like my second father god give him peace
3309644 but all these rooms are empty hassan jan no one is going to live in them
3309645 what will he think when he comes back to kabul after the war and finds that i have assumed his place in the house
3309646 i have walked long and far to see if you are as beautiful in the flesh as you are in my dreams and you are even more
3309647 you smiled coming out of me did anyone ever tell you and i wouldnt even hold you allah forgive me i wouldnt even hold you
3309648 theres going to be peace inshallah and happiness and calm no more rockets no more killing no more funerals
3309649 that letter was written six months ago a few days before i left for peshawar
3309650 the pretext was that they had evicted a trespasser hassans and farzanas murders were dismissed as a case of self defense no one said a word about it most of it was fear of the taliban i think but no one was going to risk anything for a pair of hazara servants
3309651 i heard hes in an orphanage somewhere in karteh seh
3309652 amir jan i summoned you here because i wanted to see you before i die but thats not all
3309653 i want you to go to kabul i want you to bring sohrab here
3309654 children are fragile amir jan kabul is already full of broken children and i dont want sohrab to become another
3309655 rahim khan i dont want to go to kabul i cant
3309656 sohrab is a gifted little boy we can give him a new life here new hope with people who would love him thomas agha is a good man and betty khanum is so kind you should see how she treats those orphans
3309657 why me why cant you pay someone here to go ill pay for it if its a matter of money
3309658 im a dying man and i will not be insulted it has never been about money with me you know that and why you i think we both know why it has to be you dont we
3309659 i have a wife in america a home a career and a family
3309660 one time when you werent around your father and i were talking and you know how he always worried about you in those days i remember he said to me rahim a boy who wont stand up for himself becomes a man who cant stand up to anything i wonder is that what youve become
3309661 what im asking from you is to grant an old man his dying wish
3309662 if i did i would not have asked you to come here
3309663 he was married once before to a hazara woman from the jaghori area this was long before you were born they were married for three years
3309664 she left him childless after three years and married a man in khost she bore him three daughters thats what i am trying to tell you
3309665 please think amir jan it was a shameful situation people would talk all that a man had back then all that he was was his honor his name and if people talked we couldnt tell anyone surely you can see that
3309666 why what can you possibly say to me im thirty eight years old and ive just found out my whole life is one big fucking lie what can you possibly say to make things better nothing not a goddamn thing
3309667 its not fancy like american medicine i know just an old remedy my mother taught me
3309668 no i want to know why do you do that
3309669 let me imagine agha sahib you probably lived in a big two or three story house with a nice back yard that your gardener filled with flowers and fruit trees all gated of course your father drove an american car you had servants probably hazaras your parents hired workers to decorate the house for the fancy mehmanis they threw so their friends would come over to drink and boast about their travels to europe or america and i would bet my first sons eyes that this is the first time youve ever worn a pakol
3309670 thats the real afghanistan agha sahib thats the afghanistan i know you youve always been a tourist here you just didnt know it
3309671 im sorry about your daughters and im sorry about your hand
3309672 why are you coming back here anyway sell off your babas land pocket the money and run back to your mother in america
3309673 of course no dozd would waste his time on a car as ugly as my brothers
3309674 tell the rest of the world what the taliban are doing to our country
3309675 well im not im not quite that kind of writer
3309676 you know best of course its not for me to suggest
3309677 sell this land sell that house collect the money and run away like a mouse go back to america spend the money on a family vacation to mexico
3309678 have you forgotten your manners this is my house amir agha is my guest tonight and i will not allow you to dishonor me like this
3309679 since childhood my brothers mouth has been two steps ahead of his head
3309680 i am not offended i should have explained to him my business here in afghanistan i am not here to sell property im going to kabul to find a boy
3309681 his father meant a lot to me he is the man in the photo hes dead now
3309682 take him back to peshawar there are people there who will take care of him
3309683 you are an honorable man amir agha a true afghan
3309684 i am proud to have you in our home tonight
3309685 it tells you the time in any city in the world
3309686 were hungry but were not savages he is a guest what was i supposed to do
3309687 he was a very good bicycle repairman he played the tabla well too the taliban killed him and his family and burned the village
3309688 i used to come here to jadeh maywand when i was a kid
3309689 there used to be shops here and hotels neon lights and restaurants i used to buy kites from an old man named saifo he ran a little kite shop by the old police headquarters
3309690 no shortage of police in this city but you wont find kites or kite shops on jadeh maywand or anywhere else in kabul those days are over
3309691 my father built an orphanage in shar e kohna the old city south of here
3309692 the citys generators are always going down so electricity is unreliable and people use diesel fuel
3309693 diesel remember what this street smelled like in the old days
3309694 the only people in kabul who get to eat lamb now are the taliban
3309695 dont ever stare at them do you understand me never
3309696 your friend is quite right agha you might as well poke a rabid dog with a stick
3309697 they drive around looking looking and hoping that someone will provoke them sooner or later someone always obliges then the dogs feast and the days boredom is broken at last and everyone says allah u akbar and on those days when no one offends well there is always random violence isnt there
3309698 keep your eyes on your feet when the talibs are near
3309699 do you know where the orphanage is in karteh seh
3309700 its not hard to find its just west of darulaman boulevard
3309701 the children were moved from here to karteh seh after the rockets hit the old orphanage which is like saving someone from the lions cage and throwing them in the tigers
3309702 i remember the first time i saw them rolling into kabul what a joyous day that was
3309703 an end to the killing wah wah but like the poet says how seamless seemed love and then came trouble
3309704 i should know i used to teach it at the university
3309705 from 1958 to 1996 i taught h fez khayy m rumi beydel jami saadi once i was even a guest lecturer in tehran 1971 that was i gave a lecture on the mystic beydel i remember how they all stood and clapped ha
3309706 but you saw those young men in the truck what value do you think they see in sufism
3309707 the desert weed lives on but the flower of spring blooms and wilts such grace such dignity such a tragedy
3309708 we used to sit and talk after class the last time was on a rainy day just before final exams when we shared a marvelous slice of almond cake together almond cake with hot tea and honey she was rather obviously pregnant by then and all the more beautiful for it i will never forget what she said to me that day
3309709 she said im so afraid and i said why and she said because im so profoundly happy dr rasul happiness like this is frightening i asked her why and she said they only let you be this happy if theyre preparing to take something from you and i said hush up now enough of this silliness
3309710 i wish i remembered for you but i dont your mother passed away a long time ago and my memory is as shattered as these buildings i am sorry
3309711 ill try to remember and thats a promise come back and find me
3309712 take two afghans whove never met put them in a room for ten minutes and theyll figure out how theyre related
3309713 nay sorry i know just about every single child in this institution and that one doesnt look familiar now if youll permit me i have work to do
3309714 agha agha please open the door we dont mean him any harm
3309715 the man who is with me wants to take this boy to a safe place
3309716 a good friend of mine knows an american couple there who run a charity home for children
3309717 his name was hassan his mothers name was farzana he called his grand mother sasa he knows how to read and write and hes good with the slingshot theres hope for this boy agha a way out please open the door
3309718 hes inseparable from that thing he tucks it in the waist of his pants everywhere he goes
3309719 more than we have room for about two hundred and fifty
3309720 but theyre not all yateem many of them have lost their fathers in the war and their mothers cant feed them because the taliban dont allow them to work so they bring their children here
3309721 this place is better than the street but not that much better this building was never meant to be lived in it used to be a storage warehouse for a carpet manufacturer so theres no water heater and theyve let the well go dry
3309722 ive asked the taliban for money to dig a new well more times than i remember and they just twirl their rosaries and tell me there is no money no money
3309723 we dont have enough beds and not enough mattresses for the beds we do have worse we dont have enough blankets
3309724 you see that girl this past winter the children had to share blankets her brother died of exposure
3309725 the last time i checked we have less than a months supply of rice left in the warehouse and when that runs out the children will have to eat bread and tea for breakfast and dinner
3309726 there is very little shelter here almost no food no clothes no clean water what i have in ample supply here is children whove lost their childhood but the tragedy is that these are the lucky ones were filled beyond capacity and every day i turn away mothers who bring their children
3309727 you say there is hope for sohrab i pray you dont lie agha but you may well be too late
3309728 what i have to tell you is not pleasant not to mention that it may be very dangerous
3309729 you me and of course for sohrab if its not too late already
3309730 so you say but first i want to ask you a question how badly do you want to find your nephew
3309731 despite your promise i think ill live to regret this but perhaps its just as well im damned anyway but if something can be done for sohrab ill tell you because i believe you you have the look of a desperate man
3309732 he visits once every month or two he brings cash with him not a lot but better than nothing at all
3309733 im killing him you cant stop me im killing him
3309734 i havent been paid in over six months im broke because ive spent my lifes savings on this orphanage everything i ever owned or inherited i sold to run this godforsaken place you think i dont have family in pakistan and iran i could have run like everyone else but i didnt i stayed i stayed because of them
3309735 if i deny him one child he takes ten so i let him take one and leave the judging to allah i swallow my pride and take his goddamn filthy dirty money then i go to the bazaar and buy food for the children
3309736 go to ghazi stadium tomorrow youll see him at halftime hell be the one wearing black sunglasses
3309737 i want you to go now the children are frightened
3309738 you can get good money for it on the black market feed your kids for a couple of weeks
3309739 no surprise most of the important people live here now
3309740 the people behind the taliban the real brains of this government if you can call it that arabs chechens pakistanis
3309741 thats what they call them here guests i think someday these guests are going to pee all over the carpet
3309742 how much more do you need to see let me save you the trouble nothing that you remember has survived best to forget
3309743 agha did you hear what mullah nasrud din did when his daughter came home and complained that her husband had beaten her
3309744 he beat her too then sent her back to tell the husband that mullah was no fool if the bastard was going to beat his daughter then mullah would beat his wife in return
3309745 did you hear about the time mullah had placed a heavy bag on his shoulders and was riding his donkey
3309746 someone on the street said why dont you put the bag on the donkey
3309747 that would be cruel im heavy enough already for the poor thing
3309748 why are you here i mean why are you really here
3309749 no what i mean to ask is why that boy you come all the way from america for a shia
3309750 he gets caught theyll give him a flogging that will waken his father in the grave
3309751 we are here today to carry out sharia we are here today to carry out justice we are here today because the will of allah and the word of the prophet muhammad peace be upon him are alive and well here in afghanistan our beloved homeland we listen to what god says and we obey because we are nothing but humble powerless creatures before gods greatness and what does god say i ask you what does god say god says that every sinner must be punished in a manner befitting his sin those are not my words nor the words of my brothers those are the words of god
3309752 every sinner must be punished in a manner befitting his sin
3309753 and what manner of punishment brothers and sisters befits the adulterer how shall we punish those who dishonor the sanctity of marriage how shall we deal with those who spit in the face of god how shall we answer those who throw stones at the windows of gods house we shall throw the stones back
3309754 youve done much more than ive paid you for i dont expect you to go with me
3309755 one of the better ones ive seen in a while but it really is so much better this way i think dont you
3309756 public justice is the greatest kind of show my brother drama suspense and best of all education en masse
3309757 but you want a real show you should have been with me in mazar august 1998 that was
3309758 door to door we went calling for the men and the boys wed shoot them right there in front of their families let them see let them remember who they were where they belonged
3309759 sometimes we broke down their doors and went inside their homes and id id sweep the barrel of my machine gun around the room and fire and fire until the smoke blinded me
3309760 you dont know the meaning of the word liberating until youve done that stood in a roomful of targets let the bullets fly free of guilt and remorse knowing you are virtuous good and decent knowing youre doing gods work its breathtaking
3309761 door to door we only rested for food and prayer
3309762 we left the bodies in the streets and if their families tried to sneak out to drag them back into their homes wed shoot them too we left them in the streets for days we left them for the dogs dog meat for dogs
3309763 ill ask you something what are you doing with that whore why arent you here with your muslim brothers serving your country
3309764 there are those in my circle who believe that abandoning watan when it needs you the most is the same as treason i could have you arrested for treason have you shot for it even does that frighten you
3309765 i said would you like to see him would you like to see my boy
3309766 what did you think that youd put on a fake beard and i wouldnt recognize you heres something ill bet you never knew about me i never forget a face not ever
3309767 i heard your father died tsk tsk i always did want to take him on looks like ill have to settle for his weakling of a son
3309768 im in my element the question is what are you doing here
3309769 have you ever heard of rockingham western australia a slice of heaven you should see it miles and miles of beach green water blue skies my parents live there in a beachfront villa theres a golf course behind the villa and a little lake father plays golf every day mother she prefers tennis father says she has a wicked backhand they own an afghan restaurant and two jewelry stores both businesses are doing spectacularly
3309770 so if i need money ill have them wire it to me
3309771 besides i didnt fight the shorawi for money didnt join the taliban for money either do you want to know why i joined them
3309772 anyway where was i oh yes how i joined the taliban well as you may remember i wasnt much of a religious type but one day i had an epiphany i had it in jail do you want to hear
3309773 i spent some time in jail at poleh charkhi just after babrak karmal took over in 1980
3309774 anyway we were crammed in groups of six in these tiny cells each the size of a refrigerator every night the commandant a haif hazara half uzbek thing who smelled like a rotting donkey would have one of the prisoners dragged out of the cell and hed beat him until sweat poured from his fat face then hed light a cigarette crack his joints and leave the next night hed pick someone else one night he picked me it couldnt have come at a worse time id been peeing blood for three days kidney stones and if youve never had one believe me when i say its the worst imaginable pain my mother used to get them too and i remember she told me once shed rather give birth than pass a kidney stone anyway what could i do they dragged me out and he started kicking me he had knee high boots with steel toes that he wore every night for his little kicking game and he used them on me i was screaming and screaming and he kept kicking me and then suddenly he kicked me on the left kidney and the stone passed just like that oh the relief
3309775 and i yelled allah u akbar and he kicked me even harder and i started laughing
3309776 you know i ran into that commandant on the battlefield a few years later funny how god works i found him in a trench just outside meymanah bleeding from a piece of shrapnel in his chest he was still wearing those same boots i asked him if he remembered me he said no i told him the same thing i just told you that i never forget a face then i shot him in the balls ive been on a mission since
3309777 stoning adulterers raping children flogging women for wearing high heels massacring hazaras all in the name of islam
3309778 i see this may turn out to be enjoyable after all
3309779 like pride in your people your customs your language afghanistan is like a beautiful mansion littered with garbage and someone has to take out the garbage
3309780 thats what you were doing in mazar going door to door taking out the garbage
3309781 ethnic cleansing i like it i like the sound of it
3309782 i wonder why youve come all this way amir come all this way for a hazara why are you here why are you really here
3309783 in a moment im going to close the door then he and i are going to finish an old bit of business no matter what you hear dont come in do you hear me dont come in
3309784 when its all done only one of us will walk out of this room alive
3309785 if its him then hes earned his freedom and you let him pass do you understand
3309786 put it down or what im doing to him will be a gentle ear twisting compared to what ill do to you
3309787 you must be wondering where you are what happened to you thats perfectly normal the postsurgical state is always disorienting so ill tell you what i know
3309788 you are in a hospital in peshawar youve been here two days you have suffered some very significant injuries amir i should tell you i would say youre very lucky to be alive my friend
3309789 your spleen had ruptured probably and fortunately for you a delayed rupture because you had signs of early hemorrhage into your abdominal cavity my colleagues from the general surgery unit had to perform an emergency splenectomy if it had ruptured earlier you would have bled to death
3309790 you also suffered seven broken ribs one of them caused a pneumothorax
3309791 the impact had cut your upper lip in two clean down the middle but not to worry the plastics guys sewed it back together and they think you will have an excellent result though there will be a scar that is unavoidable
3309792 there was also an orbital fracture on the left side thats the eye socket bone and we had to fix that too the wires in your jaws will come out in about six weeks
3309793 until then its liquids and shakes you will lose some weight and you will be talking like al pacino from the first godfather movie for a little while
3309794 but you have a job to do today do you know what it is
3309795 your job today is to pass gas you do that and we can start feeding you liquids no fart no food
3309796 do you know who we are today do you remember
3309797 he has outgrown them they fit sohrab pretty well i would say
3309798 we dont have a lot of room but what can i do i cant leave him to the streets besides my children have taken a liking to him ha sohrab
3309799 what happened in that house what happened between you and the talib
3309800 the landlord gave me this when i went looking for him he said rahim khan left the day after we did
3309801 the landlord didnt know he said rahim khan left the letter and the key for you and took his leave
3309802 do you want to stay here with me for a little while
3309803 are you hungry that lady there gave me a plate of biryani but i cant eat it
3309804 it will look better in a few days my son in law was in a moped accident last year his handsome face was dragged on the asphalt and became purple like an eggplant now he is beautiful again like a hollywood movie star
3309805 you know the sooner we get you out of here the better
3309806 the taliban have friends here they will start looking for you
3309807 as soon as you can walk ill take you to islamabad not entirely safe there either no place in pakistan is but its better than here at least it will buy you some time
3309808 farid jan this cant be safe for you either maybe you shouldnt be seen with me you have a family to take care of
3309809 my boys are young but they are very shrewd they know how to take care of their mothers and sisters
3309810 i will look for them as soon as i can
3309811 as for you ill pick you up this evening dont tire amir agha too much
3309812 i feel sorry for you already because i am a grand master at panjpar world renowned
3309813 when your father and i were your age we used to play this game especially in the winter when it snowed and we couldnt go outside we used to play until the sun went down
3309814 i used to beat him sometimes but i think he let me win
3309815 your father and i were nursed by the same woman
3309816 but id like to be your friend i think i could be a good friend to you would that be all right would you like that
3309817 i appreciate everything youve done for me all of you really but i have to leave
3309818 i can walk to the end of the hall and back
3309819 your friends this john and betty caldwell they arent in peshawar
3309820 there never was a john and betty caldwell in peshawar according to the people at the consulate they never existed not here in peshawar anyhow
3309821 but i want to get back tonight i miss my children
3309822 i have three of them all day they are running around troubling their mother
3309823 and were not from here im afraid he might get lost
3309824 then you should have kept an eye on the boy mister
3309825 but i fell asleep and when i woke up he was gone
3309826 theyre saying daddy daddy please buy us bicycles and well not trouble you please daddy
3309827 bicycles their mother will kill me i swear to you
3309828 yes the boy the boy who came with me have you seen him or not for gods sake
3309829 no getting smart with me my friend i am not the one who lost him
3309830 youre right im wrong my fault now have you seen him
3309831 my boys for example they will do anything for american action films especially with that arnold whatsanegger
3309832 did you know its the biggest mosque in the world
3309833 i will drive you because i am a father like you
3309834 the thing about you afghanis is that well you people are a little reckless
3309835 father took me there when i was little mother and sasa came along too father bought me a monkey from the bazaar not a real one but the kind you have to blow up it was brown and had a bow tie
3309836 i might have had one of those when i was a kid
3309837 i remember there were so many pigeons outside the masjid and they werent afraid of people they came right up to us sasa gave me little pieces of naan and i fed the birds soon there were pigeons cooing all around me that was fun
3309838 do i miss my parents well i never met my mother my father died a few years ago and yes i do miss him sometimes a lot
3309839 will god put me in hell for what i did to that man
3309840 father used to say its wrong to hurt even bad people because they dont know any better and because bad people sometimes become good
3309841 the man who hurt you i knew him from many years ago
3309842 i guess you figured that out that from the conversation he and i had he he tried to hurt me once when i was your age but your father saved me your father was very brave and he was always rescuing me from trouble standing up for me so one day the bad man hurt your father instead he hurt him in a very bad way and i i couldnt save your father the way he had saved me
3309843 youre right your father was a good man but thats what im trying to tell you sohrab jan that there are bad people in this world and sometimes bad people stay bad sometimes you have to stand up to them what you did to that man is what i should have done to him all those years ago you gave him what he deserved and he deserved even more
3309844 you saved my life in kabul i know he is very proud of you for that
3309845 and i miss sasa and rahim khan sahib but sometimes im glad theyre not theyre not here anymore
3309846 because i dont want them to see me im so dirty
3309847 they did things the bad man and the other two they did things did things to me
3309848 would you like to come live in america with me and my wife
3309849 if it has rained and the air is clear you can even see past rawalpindi
3309850 san francisco i guess so i cant say ive seen too many though
3309851 no one told me either i just found out recently
3309852 but why did people hide it from father and you
3309853 you know i asked myself that same question the other day and theres an answer but not a good one lets just say they didnt tell us because your father and i we werent supposed to be brothers
3309854 there was a red bridge and a building with a pointy top
3309855 theyre so steep when you drive up all you see is the hood of your car and the sky
3309856 no but we get a lot of fog you know that red bridge you saw
3309857 sometimes the fog is so thick in the morning all you see is the tip of the two towers poking through
3309858 have you given any thought to what i asked you before
3309859 but youll learn english so fast and youll get used to
3309860 thats not what i mean that scares me too but
3309861 what if you get tired of me what if your wife doesnt like me
3309862 not ever thats a promise youre my nephew remember and soraya jan shes a very kind woman trust me shes going to love you i promise that too
3309863 i wont ever let that happen i promise you that
3309864 why didnt you call earlier ive been sick with tashweesh my mothers praying and doing nazr every day
3309865 what do you mean fine now and whats wrong with your voice
3309866 dont worry about that for now im fine really soraya i have a story to tell you a story i should have told you a long time ago but first i need to tell you one thing
3309867 im not coming home alone im bringing a little boy with me
3309868 i have fifty seven minutes left on this stupid calling card and i have so much to tell you sit some where
3309869 i dont know what to think amir youve told me so much all at once
3309870 but i know this much you have to bring him home i want you to
3309871 amir hes your qaom your family so hes my qaom too of course im sure you cant leave him to the streets
3309872 i will and one more thing dont tell your parents who he is if they need to know it should come from me
3309873 i want to adopt this boy take him back to the states with me
3309874 i assume getting your jaws wired isnt the latest fashion statement
3309875 theres a long answer and im sure ill end up giving it to you you want the short one first
3309876 your petition to adopt this young fellow give it up thats my advice to you
3309877 lets assume the story you gave me is true though id bet my pension a good deal of it is either fabricated or omitted not that i care mind you youre here hes here thats all that matters even so your petition faces significant obstacles not the least of which is that this child is not an orphan
3309878 his parents were executed in the street the neighbors saw it
3309879 death certificates this is afghanistan were talking about most people there dont have birth certificates
3309880 i dont make the laws sir your outrage notwithstanding you still need to prove the parents are deceased the boy has to be declared a legal orphan
3309881 you wanted the long answer and im giving it to you your next problem is that you need the cooperation of the childs country of origin now thats difficult under the best of circumstances and to quote you this is afghanistan were talking about we dont have an american embassy in kabul that makes things extremely complicated just about impossible
3309882 what are you saying that i should throw him back on the streets
3309883 but that is not going to make the ins issue this young fellow a visa
3309884 im saying that if you want to help send money to a reputable relief organization volunteer at a refugee camp but at this point in time we strongly discourage u s citizens from attempting to adopt afghan children
3309885 they ought to put someone in your chair who knows what its like to want a child
3309886 have you promised this child youll take him with you
3309887 then i advise you to get a good immigration lawyer omar faisal works here in islamabad you can tell him i sent you
3309888 poor ray he hasnt been the same since his daughter died
3309889 madar is happy for us you know how she feels about you amir you can do no wrong in her eyes padar well as always hes a little harder to read hes not saying much
3309890 i think well be good for your nephew but maybe that little boy will be good for us too
3309891 i hope my children take after their mother when it comes to organization im sorry probably not the sort of thing you want to hear from your prospective lawyer heh
3309892 im familiar with the version of the situation you gave mr andrews
3309893 this must be the young man whos causing all the trouble
3309894 sohrab this is mr faisal the lawyer i told you about
3309895 did you know you are named after a great warrior
3309896 no i was born in karachi but i did live in kabul for a number of years shar e nau near the haji yaghoub mosque
3309897 i grew up in berkeley actually my father opened a music store there in the late sixties free love headbands tiedyed shirts you name it
3309898 what i told mr andrews was pretty much it save for a thing or two or maybe three ill give you the uncensored version
3309899 id appreciate that amir and why dont we just keep it in english from here on out
3309900 im sorry i have such fond memories of kabul hard to believe its the same place youre telling me about
3309901 well amir youve got a tough battle ahead of you
3309902 at the risk of sounding like raymond andrews its not likely not impossible but hardly likely
3309903 but its kids like sohrab who need a home the most
3309904 these rules and regulations dont make any sense to me
3309905 but the fact is take current immigration laws adoption agency policies and the political situation in afghanistan and the deck is stacked against you
3309906 i mean i get it but i dont get it
3309907 well its like this in the aftermath of a disaster whether it be natural or man made and the taliban are a disaster amir believe always difficult to ascertain that a child is an orphan kids get displaced in refugee camps or parents just abandon them because they cant take care of them happens all the time so the ins wont grant a visa unless its clear the child meets the definition of an eligible orphan im sorry i know it sounds ridiculous but you need death certificates
3309908 but lets suppose its clear that the child has no surviving parent even then the ins thinks its good adoption practice to place the child with someone in his own country so his heritage can be preserved
3309909 the taliban have destroyed what heritage afghans had you saw what they did to the giant buddhas in bamiyan
3309910 im sorry im telling you how the ins works amir
3309911 now a child has to be legally adopted according to the laws and regulations of his own country but when you have a country in turmoil say a country like afghanistan government offices are busy with emergencies and processing adoptions wont be a top priority
3309912 but lets suppose that somehow afghanistan gets its act together
3309913 it still may not permit this adoption in fact even the more moderate muslim nations are hesitant with adoptions because in many of those countries islamic law sharia doesnt recognize adoption
3309914 i grew up in the u s amir if america taught me anything its that quitting is right up there with pissing in the girl scouts lemonade jar but as your lawyer i have to give you the facts
3309915 finally adoption agencies routinely send staff members to evaluate the childs milieu and no reasonable agency is going to send an agent to afghanistan
3309916 it does if you can prove it im sorry do you have any papers or anyone who can support you
3309917 no one knew about it sohrab didnt know until i told him and i myself didnt find out until recently the only other person who knows is gone maybe dead
3309918 ill be frank you dont have a lot of them
3309919 you could still file an orphan petition hope for the best you could do an independent adoption that means youd have to live with sohrab here in pakistan day in and day out for the next two years you could seek asylum on his behalf thats a lengthy process and youd have to prove political persecution you could request a humanitarian visa thats at the discretion of the attorney general and its not easily given
3309920 you could relinquish him to an orphanage here then file an orphan petition start your i 600 form and your home study while hes in a safe place
3309921 im sorry the 1 600 is an ins formality the home study is done by the adoption agency you choose
3309922 its you know to make sure you and your wife arent raving lunatics
3309923 i promised him i wouldnt send him back to an orphanage
3309924 i meant to tell you in there about what youre trying to do i think its pretty great
3309925 mr faisal thinks there is a way i can take you to america with me
3309926 well thats the thing it might take a little while but he said it can be done and hes going to help us
3309927 i dont mind i can wait its like the sour apples
3309928 one time when i was really little i climbed a tree and ate these green sour apples my stomach swelled and became hard like a drum it hurt a lot mother said that if id just waited for the apples to ripen i wouldnt have become sick so now whenever i really want something i try to remember what she said about the apples
3309929 mashallah youre just about the smartest little guy ive ever met sohrab jan
3309930 will you take me to that red bridge the one with the fog
3309931 and well drive up those streets the ones where all you see is the hood of the car and the sky
3309932 i say within a year youll speak it as well as farsi
3309933 well mr faisal thinks that it would really help if we could if we could ask you to stay in a home for kids for a while
3309934 sohrab it would be for just a little while i promise
3309935 you promised youd never put me in one of those places amir agha
3309936 this is different it would be here in islamabad not in kabul and id visit you all the time until we can get you out and take you to america
3309937 im scared of that place theyll hurt me i dont want to go
3309938 no one is going to hurt you not ever again
3309939 yes they will they always say they wont but they lie they lie please god
3309940 no its not not that place god oh god please no
3309941 shhh itll be all right well go home together youll see itll be all right
3309942 please promise you wont oh god amir agha please promise you wont
3309943 i heard back from kaka sharif he said the key was getting sohrab into the country once hes in there are ways of keeping him here so he made a few calls to his ins friends he called me back tonight and said he was almost certain he could get sohrab a humanitarian visa
3309944 i know anyway well serve as the sponsors it should all happen pretty quickly he said the visa would be good for a year plenty of time to apply for an adoption petition
3309945 sohrab soraya jan just called from california we wont have to put you in the orphanage sohrab were going to america you and i did you hear me were going to america
3309946 but i am asking for you to leave my hotel please this is bad for my business very bad
3309947 i spoke to dr nawaz a few minutes ago and he thinks youll be discharged in a couple of days thats good news nay
3309948 you should try to eat some thing gain your quwat back your strength do you want me to help you
3309949 i used to read this to your father when we were children
3309950 your fathers favorite was the story of rostam and sohrab and thats how you got your name i know you know that
3309951 any way he said in his letter that it was your favorite too so i thought id read you some of it would you like that
3309952 give ear unto the combat of sohrab against rostam though it be a tale replete with tears
3309953 it came about that on a certain day rostam rose from his couch and his mind was filled with forebodings
3309954 do you want me to go on there are battles coming up remember sohrab leading his army to the white castle in iran should i read on
3309955 i want father and mother jan i want sasa i want to play with rahim khan sahib in the garden i want to live in our house again
3309956 wish you hadnt i wish you had left me in the water
3309957 sohrab i cant give you your old life back i wish to god i could but i can take you with me that was what i was coming in the bathroom to tell you you have a visa to go to america to live with me and my wife its true i promise
3309958 you know ive done a lot of things i regret in my life
3309959 and maybe none more than going back on the promise i made you but that will never happen again and i am so very profoundly sorry i ask for your bakhshesh your forgiveness can you do that can you forgive me can you believe me

3309968 you can take afghans out of paghman but you cant take paghman out of afghans
3309969 i read once that in malaysia they use kites to catch fish
3309970 ill bet you didnt know that they tie a fishing line to it and fly it beyond the shallow waters so it doesnt cast a shadow and scare the fish and in ancient china generals used to fly kites over battlefields to send messages to their men its true im not slipping you a trick
3309971 i remember the way your father checked the wind was to kick up dust with his sandal see which way the wind blew it he knew a lot of little tricks like that
3309972 did i ever tell you your father was the best kite runner in wazir akbar khan maybe all of kabul
3309973 how jealous he made the neighborhood kids hed run kites and never look up at the sky and people used to say he was chasing the kites shadow but they didnt know him like i did your father wasnt chasing any shadows he just knew
3309974 lets give him a sabagh teach him a lesson nay
3309975 watch sohrab im going to show you one of your fathers favorite tricks the old lift and dive

3309988 the icc sent us a request 10 days ago and said they would fund lawsons around 12 days trip to australia and new zealand

3309994 it is a big challenge to convince the players its upon us to convey the message and to raise the confidence
3309995 what we have seen and experienced is that the security arrangements in place should be sufficient to have the event safe and secure
