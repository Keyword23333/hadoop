2980028 u s consumers are not buying but i think the great opportunity for us internationally is business that never touches u s shores
2980029 but we always look at different things and try to fit into the puzzle
2980030 ive played in many big games but the energy tonight was different
2980031 i think they knew that history was being made tonight
2980032 obviously it was a proud moment for their country as it is for ours you could feel the electricity
2980033 the excitement of it the anxiousness of it the anticipation was just crazy
2980034 im kind of glad its out of the way now this game was just over the top
2980035 he basically came up to us and said im here to support you our country supports you and so go out there and kick some butt
2980036 i talked to geddy about it and i said i made a rookie mistake
2980037 i dont watch it religiously on tv but you follow the moves and when theyre done you say i wouldnt have done that i think it was the opportunity i got a phone call said let me think about it and i talked to mr stabile about it
2980038 any leagues good if youre going to manage i think youve got to start somewhere
2980039 the hardest thing is for these new managers to realize these players are going to independent baseball for a reason its just a little different you just have to be yourself and teach the game and for the most part they do that theyre going off passion and motivation
2980040 its close to home it keeps me around my family it allows you some time to do some things in the off season gives me a chance to watch my kids grow up
2980041 but sometimes i think i do this out of necessity as well theres not too many other things im very good at
2980042 regardless of whether its affiliated baseball or independent baseball its baseball
2980043 its part of our life its part of what we do its moving on to the next step in the game but you still do it because you enjoy it
2980044 i like being around the game i like being around the kids the managing part im not real big on im learning it the in game strategy learning different parts of the game as much as we think we played and we know it all theres a lot of intricate details you have to pay attention to but still its the game
2980045 as much as you try to help people get better as much as you think youre doing what you should do the game is forever evolving you have to forever adjust with it
2980046 its like a reminder of what you know the toughest thing is dealing with travel dealing with being tired the reminders of where you are i guess its minor league baseball its not major league baseball thats ok you know what youre buying into when you get there its a grind
2980047 i think affiliated ball would be more of a grind than this
2980048 id have to do reports itd be we dont care if we win were trying to develop talent when youre playing the game you play to win im sure they do too the managers in affiliated ball but they realize that theyre players are going to be gone theyll be moving from one team level to another
2980049 but i havent managed before again ive surprised myself ive probably made fewer mistakes than i thought i would
2980050 im too busy doing this the opportunities will take care of themselves
2980051 who am i to say i dont know what theyre looking for
2980052 everybodys trying to build their resume and all sorts of things im not trying to do that i have a challenge this year working with the pitchers i used to work with the hitters so learning that part of it is difficult trying to take care of 11 guys and then 22 is difficult
2980053 but i think taking an affiliated job depends its one of those things that depends on if it works depends on situations does it work for you does it work for the family how much time is spent away it has to financially work for me
2980054 now i do things out of necessity we all try to make ends meet i have three kids in college ones in a private high school its not like im playing major league baseball anymore theres a combination of pressures that come with life
2980055 having former major leaguers here as managers and coaches gives the league some credibility
2980056 its always nice to see guys who have played and you can bounce stuff off i probably dont talk to them enough
2980057 weve been to a place where they would like to go
2980058 we can be information for them if they want to ask i dont think a whole lot of us would tell it if we werent asked
2980059 even though its an opportunity for them to play and continue to play as a pro and maybe move on theres an awful lot of people that come through here that i say to them im sorry and thats hard who am i to say that youre not good enough i could be wrong and the toughest part is its based on the limited knowledge that i have
2980060 i probably think the talent level is better than i thought it would be
2980061 im looking at the league as a whole ive seen the players that are in the league what theyre capable of doing and its probably surprised me a little bit i wasnt sure what to expect you never know
2980062 but i think baseball is baseball it keeps me busy keeps me out of trouble and keeps me in the game somehow

2980087 we still have to sit down as a committee and review all that and the divisions would be divided up so that they would make geographical sense and the teams wouldnt be traveling as far to play their games especially with fuel being so high these days
2980088 youd have district a 1 and a 2 and district b 1 and b 2 and thats to soften the schedule a little bit for the teams
2980089 right now they play each team in their district twice and district b had to play 20 games this year in a matter of five weeks so in the interest of getting them to satisfy their schedule sooner theyll only have a minimum of 14 to 16 games next year
2980090 the other part driving the decision to have four divisions is the amount of teams and the shortened season due to the new hampshire interscholastic athletic association moving their state tournament up a week into ours which crunches our time a little bit
2980091 on the other end the legion is moving their regional tournament up a week next year so were really going to have a short season next year
2980092 i havent heard from any teams looking to bail out but we have had interest from other american legion posts that are interested in joining the program so that would mean more teams and adjusting our divisions
2980093 we would like some moderate form of expansion as opposed to contraction
2980094 its been a long season with the rainouts being extremely frustrating for everybody the teams coaches managers and the whole rescheduling of games its time for us to catch our breath a little bit
2980095 he looked poised for a young guy and mike has to be happy with his quarterback coming out and looking fairly sharp
2980096 i thought matt passed the test in terms of poise and execution
2980097 i thought for the first time in an nfl game he was very impressive
2980098 i thought it was important for me to get out there tonight and compete against a team we know is going to be very successful
2980099 i thought it was a good start i still have a long way to go and im glad that one is under my belt
2980100 thats a lot of fun to get in there against some of their starters and get some work
2980101 i settled down and did some good things and some bad things but got more comfortable as i went along
2980102 i dont have any doubt not just because i was here i know thats a good football team and i thought our guys stood in there and went toe to toe with them in the first half thats a positive

2980138 im getting older and ive been in the military to serve and ive never had the opportunity to deploy as a nurse
2980139 im looking forward to experiencing the different cultures ive been taking some of the language courses the military offers online
2980140 that gives you a good feeling in and of itself knowing you are part of that kind of movement
2980141 i think the biggest part that concerns me is just not knowing what is going to happen until i see him again when he was working as a nurse i knew he would be in a hospital now i dont know what hes doing
2980142 im proud of him its something hes always wanted to do
2980143 ive always wanted to be a soldier ive always enjoyed the military it helps me feel young it keeps me in shape

2980146 its an excellent opportunity for students at westfall we feel for our students its the right thing to do a new building is more efficient to do that than to try to retrofit an old building which is a very expensive and difficult task

2980148 there were difficult times back then too but the people of westfall were still determined to build a middle school

2980158 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2980159 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2980160 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2980161 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2980162 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2980163 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2980164 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2980165 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2980169 given your committees recent focus on deep packet inspection in connection with advertising we feel it important to state clearly and for the record that google does not deliver advertising based on deep packet inspection
2980170 we understand that many of the questions that you have posed to us and a number of other companies stem from concerns about that particular model for online advertising but we believe that the vast majority of online advertisers like google is not engaged in these practices
2980171 questions have been raised regarding the applicability of privacy protections and whether legislation is needed to ensure that the same protections apply regardless of the particular technologies or companies involved
2980172 we understand this question to be focused primarily on the implementation of deep packet inspection advertising practices by a small number of u s isps in partnership with a privately held online advertising company

2980321 my layout is about how bold and cheeky i feel after i get a hair cut i feel like a totally new person because i rarely have a hair style i enjoy all of the comments and feel very stylish i scrapped these pictures because i really dont recognize myself in them and think it has to do with my change in attitude after my hair cut

2980324 being able to find the books i need at a lower price was easy at freestudentlistings com and i met the seller right at school to pick up my books
2980325 the concept of freestudentlistings com is simply to help students save money when they need it most
2980326 another reason why this concept allows students to save more money on their textbooks is because freestudentlistings com is independent of wholesalers campus bookstores can only sell what the wholesalers tell them to sell if a publisher puts out a new edition the campus bookstore can no longer sell the older editions however freestudentlistings com allows any edition to be posted and sold on their website this allows students to speak with their professors to see if they will accept the old editions if the professor says yes the student can save money by purchasing an older book

2980361 thanks to let us enjoy of this unique opportunity to use professional astrophotography equipment i am a beginner in this world and i know how difficult it is to get pictures from the night sky with gras i have been able to get high quality pictures with only a pair of mouse clicks
2980362 i live in albuquerque nm about 100 miles from incredible dark skies and have been doing ap since 1996 as a hobby but this means moving many hundreds of pounds of equipment to those skies and hoping the weather is still good when i get there spending many hours packing the truck and trailer and spending 150 on gas and more on camping supplies renders this to a 3 or 4 day trip with loss from work so to be able to use world class equipment under world class skies while sitting at my desk in my robe on sunday morning is just mind boggling thank you

2980456 i knew i had to do something about it but i didnt know how to support my family financially while spending more time on my music and less time at work
2980457 i decided that i was going to start off small and work my way towards my goal of being my own boss
2980458 i joined the heavy metal band because there was nothing else in my neighborhood at the time if i had the option then i would have chosen hip hop if you listen to my hip hop beats you will notice they have a rock and roll edge to them i think that makes them unique

2980464 mark was very talented but i knew that i could help him with his marketing the first thing i noticed was the fact that he did not have his own website the beat marketplaces are a good way to make a couple sales here and there but there lots of noise on those pages that take the potential customers attention away from his product the first thing we did was build mark a site and promote his company brand bos beats
2980465 in order to make loyal customers we have given our customers many advantages when they think of purchasing a beat they come to us because we give them more for their money in this day and age of high gas prices and inflation thats all everyone is looking for more for their money thats what the site is built around

2980574 well nothing really i havent seen you in a couple weeks where have you been
2980575 oh just bogged down with signing up for classes next year working hard on those important credits
2980576 anyhow i was just calling to see if you wanted to catch a movie with me later or something like that
2980577 hey yeah i was thinking about catching diary of the dead
2980578 yeah how about we meet up at the multiplex at one and well see that
2980579 i am marinating in the victory i have just had
2980580 victory how warped has your mind become that you consider that a victory
2980581 do you have any idea how long ive been trying to get a date with missy reynolds
2980582 wrong i gave up all that crap i am now one hundred percent normal human i am sick and tired of putting up with all those penalties i get for being maple boy and the trauma i go through its not worth it
2980583 okay i understand somone died yesterday under your command thats essentially a rite of passage for heroes to cope with the death of a civilian but you cant let it get you down normally theyre expected to fall into a recessive ditch afterwards but they always come out within a week
2980584 not this time i dont think you quite understand i just gave it all up theres no going back that whole hero thing was just a fling and i dont intend on reliving any of it
2980585 this isnt some whiny emo kid wanting to make everyone sad this is a serious threat somebody died and thats not even the whole of it more people are going to die especially if no one is going to look out for them youre the only one that can help them
2980586 i am done with it what do you not understand i cant deal with it i cant look at a dead body knowing that i could have stopped it no matter how good my intentions are its just not me
2980587 you once told me that you are you once told me that you could you showed me that you had the integrity and better knowledge to make good decisions you proved yourself as one of the better superheroes of our times i know you can suck this up and deal with it and you are going to have to because something is coming sure your friends are out there doing their best but they cant do it alone
2980588 cant you understand im just not the kind of person that can sacrifice virtually his entire life for the life of others well i can but this is just getting ridiculous i have tried so hard to forget everything about that stupid half life i had and every time i think back on it all i get is painful memories so please just leave me the hell alone
2980589 you couldnt remember the faces or the voices or anything like that all you could remember was that feeling
2980590 weve all been there but that works both ways you may not be able to remember any of the good times you had as maple boy but i know if you spend half a second thinking on it all those great feelings of triumph will come rushing back the satisfactory warmth whenever you saved a life or a vanquished a villain and thatll glow within you ten times stronger than that cloud of guilt ever will
2980591 a van like in ghostbusters isnt that a little bit derivative
2980592 hey it was a good idea i didnt just want to let it go to waste because it had been done before
2980593 well in the story its just gonna seem like youre ripping off eighties comedies
2980594 well in retrospect thats pretty much what im doing im also stealing a little bit from fright night
2980595 a little bit a grimmer scenery than the mystery machine i must admit
2980596 well its a bit grimmer a setting than scooby doo
2980597 so what is this some advanced van hyped up with various new technologies
2980598 i mean are there any crazy upgrades you slapped on this thing pimp your ride mysticality style some kind of magic school van james bond turned monster hunter enormous guns pop out the sides wild ejection command its not a transformer by chance
2980599 ah no just a normal average van well thats not entirely true i tripped out the stereo system like crazy
2980600 anyway i think i better ask a couple more questions
2980601 so where did you get the funding from all this
2980602 so what do your parents think of this career youve gotten yourself into
2980603 not too much theyve been in africa on a research trip for the last year they live upstairs either way i live in the basement not too much communication
2980604 well uh how is this activity affecting your school life
2980605 its pretty irrelevant considering i dropped out two months ago
2980606 well uh with no education how do plan on making money in the future
2980607 obviously my jobs gonna help me out fighting monsters is tough work and the pay is good even if that doesnt quite cover my future we return to the large inheritance
2980608 sorry dude i just gotta say this little case you have going on here is totally bogus its a prank no ones gotten bit by any vampires vampires dont exist monsters dont exist thats fairy tales
2980609 its not fairy tales mr reporter this isnt some fantasy this is all real sure ill give you maybe this one call is some sick joke i wouldnt be surprised but i think im a higher authority on the supernatural world than you are and if you dont mind id like you to stop referring to all of this as mystical because that implies that it doesnt exist and i can tell you first hand that it does it does indeed
2980610 whatever doesnt really matter to me youre level of sanity i just really regret taking this story thats all
2980611 actually it was my roommate that called you shes the one that needs you im trina by the way
2980612 damn that sucks that woulda been cool if it were her
2980613 oh that i was just blessing the room always a good idea
2980614 i dont really see what that has to do with anything
2980615 alright i want you to explain to me how this unfolded why do you think theres vampires involved with your life
2980616 well last night i had this guy over we were working on this project ill admit hes a cute guy and hes got this great accent i asked him where he was from
2980617 anyways the night goes on he kisses me i kiss him that goes on for a little while then he bites me on the neck
2980618 well there isnt anything there you didnt engage in sexual intercourse with him did you
2980619 well recent studies have shown that vampirism has been able to spread through sexual relations
2980620 nah im just messing with you theres a nasty bite back there and its definitely a vampire
2980621 anyway have you felt any recent repulsions to silver bad things happen when your around holy things allergic reaction to garlic
2980622 then this proves my theory see if youre bitten by a vampire youve got three midnights until you become one yourself the only way to prevent this is to kill the vampire who started this chain i prefer to call him the head vampire before the third midnight so heres another question did he bite you before or after midnight
2980623 definitely he was outta here by eleven trina can vouch for that
2980624 so one midnight has already passed we have til tomorrow at midnight to kill this creep that bit you what can you tell us about him
2980625 well a pretty buff guy i guess long gleaming black hair black bowler cap circular sunglasses big blag trenchcoat he goes to hillgarden community college come to think of it hes probably there as we speak
2980626 call me if you start experiencing any weird symptons by the way
2980627 we proved that celebrity magazine readers were not obese women who spent all day watching tv and smoking cigarettes
2980628 if this thing was on youtube it would be all over the world
2980629 dark alleys are not the best places to linger especially for teenage girls or cats for that matter
2980630 no one else has met me what makes you think you ever would
2980631 well if i didnt would anything in the universe make sense i mean the world would just seem really pointless for some reason am i right
2980632 you know i really cant imagine it any other way its like we were absolutely meant to meet here today like our futures depended on it weird
2980633 i dont want to be running around in some stupid outfit like some blue suit with a number on it how stupid would that look
2980634 oh yeah its killer you dont have to pay for bus rides running from dogs is no longer an issue and i can now easily prove that anvils fall faster than feathers
2980635 well i think youre pretty awesome flying around saving the world stuff like that
2980636 i think im pretty awesome too so i saw you with some asshole earlier saw him throw around this kid a bit who was that
2980637 oh that was my boyfriend sean he is a bit of an asshole
2980638 well there is a middle ground i think between superhero and asshole
2980639 you dont seem to think about superheroes too much for being one
2980640 im a little more considered on other people being a superhero and all by the way you seem to think about superheroes quite a bit for not being one
2980641 one of the hardest problems a hero ever has to face
2980642 but but youre dead you died in my arms how
2980643 dead like obi wan kenobi dead like jacob marley dead like freddy krueger dead like mufasa
2980644 youre a memory a ghost a spirit remaining in the real world for some unusual reason
2980645 well its a little more complicated than that see i wont explain it right now but it involves a bet thats all ill say regardless back to the obvious problem your having you want to be with her but you know that your hero status puts her in a very compromising position its a pretty common problem
2980646 ah solutions are not so common im afraid i guess it really relates to your priorities here if you get together with her as you wish she will be in constant jeapordy if you let her go shell be much safer
2980647 well youre making one sound a hell of a lot more selfish and reckless than the other
2980648 thats just how it sounds you know that phrase if you love something let it go makes a lot more sense now doesnt it
2980649 dude you are like a year older than me why are you acting like you know so much more
2980650 you learn fast when youre a hero you learn a lot faster when youre a dead hero now im not telling you what to do in fact im not really helping it all besides making your two options pretty plain its entirely your decision
2980651 then go with it if your resolve comes to you so quickly then it is the one you should do
2980652 yeah it is let me tell you this though theres some good upsides but there are some of the worst downsides you can imagine you cant take the pros and leave the cons when it comes to heroics you really got to take it all are you ready to do that
2980653 hell i saved the world i can take the cons
2980654 well whatever you ultimately decide know that it will affect the remainder of your life
2980655 it aint as bad as youd think i mean it really sucks i cant hug anymore but the omnipotency is pretty cool i take it youve decided
2980656 well then my business is done here peace out maple boy got high hopes for you
2980657 that is it i have had it with these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane
2980658 i want this to be an open and shut case i want to get to this college kill this nocturnal baddie return back to our hot client and live happily ever after so lets do this quick
2980659 i thought you didnt go for the whole fairy tales happy ending crap
2980660 i never said i didnt go for them happily ever after is the ultimate dream of humanity thats the most legitimate part of fairy tales if you ask me
2980661 you in or out it could get mighty dangerous in there
2980662 im a field reporter kind of a misnomer if im not in the field i can handle myself thank you very much
2980663 its a college full of kids and most of them are probably on lunch in a minute
2980664 well i kind of pictured us entering an empty hallway finding small clues of the vampires presence and tracking him to his location there we catch him off guard and stab him in the heart with a stake quick and easy
2980665 i was thinking empty hallway too only as soon as we step in he catches us off guard we get in a little skirmish but we eventually manage to best him and we emerge triumphant why what did you have in mind tom
2980666 im a reporter if i had an imagination id be a writer
2980667 alright were just gonna have to split up and try and find him we got a pretty decent description of him lets get to it
2980668 hey you guys know i dont have a weapon or anything im pretty much a sitting duck here
2980669 well ive been good so what are you two doing here you dropped out of high school im pretty sure you arent on the roster here
2980670 oh man we got multiple reasons number one were meeting up with our friend jake hes an old buddy of ours one of the college going types though anyways hes hookin us up with some fake ids which are sure to help us with those modern day hassles at the liquor store
2980671 second college is pretty much the best place in the area to pick up good pot half the jerks here are dealing and is not a craze to miss up
2980672 third most important and most obvious is naturally college chicks
2980673 but on the subject what the ell are you doin ere
2980674 oh yeah man you got the monster thing going on so what the game afoot
2980675 well have either of you seen anything unusual about the area
2980676 man look around you youre at college man weird shit goes down all the time here
2980677 i mean aready this mornin ive seen a hobbit mary poppins i swear i saw a man grow twice as fat in half a second
2980678 crocodile dundee was runnin around earlier some kid thats gotta be the offspring of a skunk and a dung beetle
2980679 yeah yeah crazy lookin dude big black trenchcoat dark shades badass looking i said something to him as he walked passed what i say pug
2980680 he went about that way a minute or two before you showed up
2980681 i assume you have some serious business with me as to track me down to my place of education have i done something wrong
2980682 i am trying to have a lecture in here so if you boys dont mind keeping quiet
2980683 ah intuitive human i must assume that you are mike monster murderer i have heard of you i must say i am impressed with your bravery and willpower to hunt me down
2980684 well thats great but today i guess im going to have to lose a fan
2980685 although i respect you michael i assure you i am no fan of you however i warn you now you will not best me in any battle lay this crusade to rest and i will spare you your life
2980686 yeah so i leave you both of us live pretty decent deal until two weeks from now when youve turned the entire town and im holed up in a strip club fighting off every one of you bloodsuckers
2980687 i think id rather fight you now then a few thousand of you later
2980688 i offer again leave me now or i shall kill your friend
2980689 yeah thats a real triumph youd have there if youre going to kill one of us at least half the decency to do it in battle not in cold blood
2980690 we always kill in cold blood figuratively speaking of course
2980691 so then he sends me a text message and im like oh i so totally dont wanna read this but i open it anyways
2980692 that guy with the canes badass guys with canes are badass
2980693 we need to get back to the basement this girl needs help
2980694 i dont know but if they ever lay one aluminum appendage on my baby therell be hell to pay
2980695 ive taken a sudden interest in this mike character the printed this business card
2980696 an interesting profession no doubt i want an interview with him whos up for it
2980697 youre an impressive writer why dont you take this one
2980698 yeah well what is your thing you dont want to write sports you dont want to write about dances is there anything you do want to write

2980700 take this story impress me with it and you can write whatever you want
2980701 ah the ultimatum and it is ever so sweet i knock your socks off with this report of a mediocre phenomenon and i have freedom of what i write
2980702 mike monster murderer interesting name doesnt really flow though you ever though of mike monster slayer
2980703 so i would assume by the title suggested that you murder monsters what exactly qualifies as a monster to you
2980704 vampires werewolves demons phantoms wendigos really big rats i cant stand rats
2980705 what exactly prompted you to enter into this rarely practiced career
2980706 well uh actually its a little bit personal i had a great aunt bitten by a vampire she lived a horrible life after that i mean a life of two weeks but that doesnt mean it was good im just kind of trying to make sure that doesnt happen to anyone else
2980707 well uh think supply and demand here how many reports of zombies do we get in this town country world
2980708 well there wasnt really anyone to report it to before was there
2980709 so uh what exactly have you done to prepare for such threats
2980710 well im a pretty good hunter i mean i grew up in vancouver we hunted a lot im a good fighter took some kickboxing classes on top of that i have this fantastic little encyclopedia on the mystical from one of the greatest hunters of all time the books practically my bible
2980711 do you have any prior experience in this field any evil vanquished in the past
2980712 well thats where it was gobleavenue is just what he called it
2980713 so you vanquished a little green man thus preparing you to fight vampires and such how did you go about that
2980714 i killed it i dont really want to get into the details thats kind of classified
2980715 you are fully aware that abraham van helsing is a fictional character
2980716 what you tell them little science geeks that albert einstein was a fictional character
2980717 mike monster murderer how may i help you oh i see how big is it
2980718 i mean i dont see how you can confuse twelve inches with eighteen inches its not like their similar twelve and eighteen dont even rhyme you damn well better make another one oh so i guess its gonna take another half hour for it to get here huh yeah oh half off the crap pizza thrown in free jeez youre desperate well get it over here on the double oh and i swear if you mess it up again you lose me yeah well bye then

2980724 put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch
2980725 master we toiled all night and took nothing but at your word i will let down the nets
2980726 depart from me for i am a sinful man o lord
2980727 do not be afraid from now on you will be catching men
2980728 the fish when they are caught are transported from life to death but men from death to life
2980729 this is my commandment that you love one another as i have loved you
2980730 we wasnt exactly the noblest of men rather a bastard really
2980731 oh of course not what he had in that bag of is was more what brought me to finish him
2980732 and dont ask me what was in the bag for i simply cant tell you that
2980733 my name is supersam im sure youve heard of me
2980734 then youre obviously new to the business i have the ability to mentally control cows think aquaman but with dairy and a woman
2980735 why the business of being a hero of course its pretty much become a career nowadays
2980736 well surely you must be aware of the super hero international triumvirate
2980737 well we all dont just prance about righting wrongs and solving crimes you see there is some order to things the super hero international triumvirate is a complex organization amongst us extraordinary we are headed by three of the greatest heroes of our time im assuming youre american
2980738 even better weve not had a canadaian correspondent for some time what qualifications have you
2980739 oh well then i suppose you cant really be in the running just yet hopefully someday then whats your name ill put in the good word for you
2980740 well we do need a new member ever since we lost morman so try and get up to speed
2980741 oh so you are the brave warrior his spirit spoke of at the battle of the waterfall cave
2980742 you who ended the reign of the evil sadness madness who so deviously took one of our bravest warriors from us
2980743 well that may change things ill talk things over with the others on the subject of your induction however now that i know this i must warn you of something our intelligence informs us that there is trouble brewing in the north a threat far greater than any you have ever faced and its power grows evermore each day across the border in a land even foreign to you i must warn you of this maple boy for i have no doubt that whatever evil this is there is no way you may face it if ever trouble should arise simply seek me out and i will call upon my friends to aid you in your plight do you understand this
2980744 very good then aside i must be on my way i am expected elsewhere
2980745 simply follow the cows to find me if you ever need my assistance until we meet again maple boy enjoy this life for few others will ever
2980746 i dont know man but whatever it was it doesnt like cars very much it totaled almost every single one in that area it was kind of weird though hippie apeman yours was completely untouched everyone around was crushed but yours was totally fine
2980747 do you see do you see what youve done to her when will you people ever learn that fighting is never the answer she just wanted her purse her pictures of her parents and friends her memories thats all she came back for and your blatant disregard for all those around you did this to her
2980748 i saw how it happened that thing was about to shoot you people you special people with whatever the hell that was and what did you do about it did you take the hit no you brought your fight elsewhere to save your asses and this is what happened you killed my best friend
2980749 i got some info on goble avenue like you asked me to
2980750 obviously the street is named after goble forest the woodlands bordering it now legend has it that goble forest is an enchanted wood clearly this rumour has been discredited multiple times but we know better take note enchanted wood not evil hellish or malicios anyways a few hundred years ago think colonial times a village stood where that street does now goble village this is where the legend gets a little less popular presumably one of the most notable residents of the village was a witch although she was not so much a witch as she was an authority on the mystical she spent vast amounts of time in the cursed forest and had been witnessed doing some unholy activities by this means the villagers were convinced she was a witch she was burned at the stake now heres where this story has a real level of importance as she burned she lay a curse upon the land that it would become a magnet to the supernatural and the forest would be a haven for the wicked the villagers were eventually run out of town by the evil things inhabiting it after that day and evenutally the village was torn down and transformed into a street
2980751 unfortunately the old witch laid a curse on the land not the village so that street is still crawling with baddies
2980752 really describe the noises where are you really ill be over in a moment
2980753 we gotta leave in like two minutes i got a disturbance guess where
2980754 well i need some company drews running experiments on veronica vampire and our reporter is out cold youre all i got left so get ready and start up the van
2980755 its in the barn there i dont know what the hell it is it looks like some kinda hamster bear
2980756 i have a pretty good idea of what it is
2980757 what the hell do you think youre doing thats not solving anything
2980758 if we dont get out of here real soon youre next
2980759 spanish for goat sucker think of it as a vampire of livestock my theory is that chupacabra are somewhat pets or familiars to vampires which would explain both monstrosoties turning up in one day it seems to make its home in goble forest which proves a little portion of that legend this case suddenly got much more interesting
2980760 he said he couldnt deal with all this adventure crap
2980761 oh i ran some tests you might want to come take a look at this
2980762 this explains why vampires crave blood infected blood is black and it decays generally swiftly fresh blood is infected and begins to decay as well therefore a steady supply of fresh blood is needed to keep the vampire alive
2980763 so how long would it take to starve a vampire
2980764 well on that note i think im gonna take off
2980765 i think i need a little bit more information from our infected client i should be back in
2980766 rest up guys well have a day in store for us tomorrow
2980767 i think its best to just cut them off now
2980768 it will be safer to battle them outside the city
2980769 theres a lot more open space and virtually no civilians
2980770 are you kidding were not anywhere near ready to just march out and meet them
2980771 yeah if we stay here we have more time to prepare we can create a strategy for once
2980772 theres people here our strategy should be not killing more innocent people
2980773 obezos right well fight them on the outskirts of town
2980774 what are you our leader now you dont just decide what the goup does i say we take a vote
2980775 this isnt a government were a band of heroes now if you want to be reckless and stay here then you can do that i am going out there to stop that apocalypse and if you want to come out and help me then feel free to
2980776 regardless of where we fight were never as strong as we are together
2980777 you boys have got to be more careful about the battles you fight
2980778 well then im telling them what they need to know to not be amateurs how about that
2980779 that whole yelling thing hes just a little bit haywire it comes with the mind control thing apparently he cant introduce himself so boys meet afro thunder
2980780 were all three part of an organization called the super hero international triumvirate
2980781 the spirit of morman alerted us of the danger you were in
2980782 and thank heavens he did or else you all would be long forgotten heroes
2980783 we need to get these boys back to base and debriefed this is a serious matter here
2980784 but yes we do need to bring the group of you in for questioning immediately
2980785 alright i guess we can do that just let us check on our friend
2980786 sorry kid thats far beyond the proximity of my powers
2980787 you know enough not to go after that thing alone you have no idea where its going
2980788 make the most you can of the indian hemp seed and sow it everywhere
2980789 in vietnam where cannabis grows wild and free people rarely smoke it themselves instead they feed it to their pigs who get the serious munchies the result is that the farmers produce some very fat and very chilled out pigs

2980800 attacking left wingers and police officers with an aggression that can be seen as a change in strategy
2980801 before neo nazis largely avoided violence for tactical reasons but this no longer appears to be the case
2980802 i see a new character above all after the riots on 1 may in hamburg
2980803 on a planet 4c hotter all we can prepare for is our extinction
2980804 in the immortal words that chief seattle probably never spoke the end of living and the beginning of survival is just around the corner
2980805 but what are we to do the answer we must achieve long term stabilisation at 350 parts per million of co2 equivalent for more information visit
2980806 beste mevrouw voncken mijn hrm collega mevr j hinskens heeft voo
2980807 beste meneer melfor bedankt voor uw interesse indien u uw cont
2980808 ben geinteresseerd in de cursus vanuit curacao hoe zit het precies in
2980809 it is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but essentially are hindering us
2980810 i mean the transfer by the united states of a georgian contingent in iraq with military transport planes practically to the conflict zone
2980811 the very scale of this cynicism is astonishing the attempt to turn white into black black into white and to adeptly portray victims of aggression as aggressors and place the responsibility for the consequences of the aggression on the victims
2980812 russia of course will take its peacekeeping mission to a logical conclusion we will strive for working relations with all participants of this conflict and that of course includes the georgian side
2980813 das kann ich ihnen nicht sagen ich habe hier so viele akten liegen senden sie bitte ein fax dann kriegen sie eine antwort
2980814 at this time were focusing on the health and welfare of the guests involved in this tragic accident
2980815 the take home message here is its a big deal
2980816 its probably the biggest impact in the shortest time that i can think of
2980817 if i can use some of that heat energy and convert it to electricity you can improve the overall efficiency
2980818 there are several other steps that are required to commercialize the material but were cautiously optimistic that these steps can be carried out successfully
2980819 we think we can make people feel cooler more quickly feel comfortable more quickly and that will translate into less power in the central ac system
2980820 we send a special thank you to the people of beijing the people of new zealand and of course the people of america
2980821 we have been lifted up by the outpouring of support and love weve received from around the world
2980822 running out of oil and must wean ourselves off of it
2980823 this isnt just a career for me its my passion
2980824 if i was independently wealthy and i didnt need an income i would do this for nothing thats how much i love it
2980825 they can be very dangerous animals if you dont know what youre doing
2980826 its very unlikely a person on a massage table is going to kick me
2980827 it was an exciting race and wasnt as easy as it looked especially after the second to last yellow
2980828 it was really difficult to pass the acuras but the traffic helped me get a little closer and then tdi power helped me overtake them after that everything was really nice
2980829 the u s government has spent some 7 billion building a repository for nuclear waste at yucca mountain in nevada
2980830 coal is making us sick oil is making us sick
2980831 on june 3 the department of energy submitted an 8 600 page application to the nuclear regulatory commission seeking approval of the yucca mountain site for waste storage just one day later nevada urged the agency to reject the application
2980832 no u s plant worker or member of the public has ever been injured or killed by an accident caused by nuclear power
2980833 i just think of something and i start to write the story adding things as i go along
2980834 i like writing at school but i write at home as well i have lots of stories on my computer
2980835 id actually like to be a writer and a vet i like animals and put them in my stories
2980836 i wrote it a while ago while i was doing a creative writing course at edinburgh university but i had to change it a bit for a family newspaper because of a bit of bad language
2980837 im really pleased to have won im over the moon
2980838 were looking at key locations and edinburgh is a major city so we are very keen
2980839 you can see why it would be attractive to hotel operators
2980840 the difficulty that office developers are having is securing finance which has made it slightly easier for hotel developers who have cash resources and can compete better with the office market
2980841 edinburgh is still a strong destination and people will be able to find the price they want to pay
2980842 the closing date has passed and a number of offers were received but no deal has been concluded yet
2980843 having a festival without the usher hall would be unimaginable and we are exceptionally grateful to the city of edinburgh council usher hall management and the festivals own team of contractors for ensuring the hall was ready for our sold out opening concert and the 22 other festival concerts programmed there this august
2980844 as a thank you for the great efforts rain or shine on the part of all involved the least we could do was ensure that they got to see performances in the venue they had worked so hard to transform we hope they enjoy a night on us at the usher hall with our sincerest thanks
2980845 this is the most exciting moment of the year after months of planning and work artists are about to unleash their creative energy and ideas on thousands of people across the citys venues
2980846 i only live round the corner so ive come every year it was a shame about the rain but it was easy to nip inside one of the tents
2980847 i sort of dipped in and out of most of the shows so i saw some cabaret comedy music and theatre one of the best things about the fringe is you get the chance to see acts from around the world all in one place
2980848 my daughter likes the street performers who juggle fire and things which was a bit unfortunate for me because they performed outside when it was raining

2980859 there is no doubt i am against the indo us nuclear deal my point against the deal is that we must first deal with terrorism unless we do not deal with terrorism we would be planting nuclear bombs in the form of reactors
2980860 india has lost a lot to terrorism including two prime ministers the country still continues to suffer from terrorism

2980875 our research identified a significant gap between what people say and what they do when it comes to protecting sensitive information online
2980876 personalising content and delivering relevant advertising online will only succeed for consumers and for advertisers if it is done in a trustworthy and transparent manner
2980877 in addition business and government will need to offer approaches that recognise that at certain times personalisation and data use will be welcomed and in other cases users will demand limits on the use of their data
2980878 we are increasingly aware of our reputation online and the risks associated with a lack of timely information
2980879 we are committed to delivering a first class service to our customers and see agl as an important partner in providing us with a complete picture of what is being said where and which steps we should be taking to react to or drive online conversations
2980880 consumers are increasingly making purchasing decisions based on what they discuss and hear through forums blogs and message boards so the internet can be dangerous to brands and products as the content and opinions on it are largely unregulated and not entirely impartial
2980881 brands have had until now little ability to track understand and influence what consumers are saying about products issues and companies online

2980889 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2980890 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2980891 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2980892 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2980893 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2980894 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2980895 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2980896 tout ceci est tr s ill gal le mat riel suivant nest donc qu but informatif

2980911 you fucked up again this year so we aint coming again toilets were worse than last year apart from the urinals which didnt help the ladies out much cancellations could have been dealt with better you didnt let any fucker know what was going on so then bands djs got pushed forward back so chances are alot of people missed out on who they wanted to see anyway dan deacon not showing was the nail in the coffin
2980912 oddly i think i actually enjoyed last years disaster more even though the sound and bar situations were much improved this time around again girls pissing everywhere does not make for an enjoyable experience the intimate vibe of last year has gone out of the window

2980921 i think its going to be a great opportunity to buy chinese shares because the long term growth will be there china is going to grow probably three times as fast as the global average
2980922 in the short term there are a lot of headwinds
2980923 i dont think china should go back to the 11 to 12 percent rate thats overheated
2980924 this slowdown should help china to sustain growth for the longer term
2980925 when growth slows down the demand for energy and the demand for metal will come down that may bring down the inflation
2980926 a slowdown in the u s and especially a global slowdown will hit china
2980927 growth hasnt fallen off a cliff its holding up reasonably well but moderating thats true in corporate earnings as well as the macro economy
2980928 every major political transition in china has had inflation at either the backdrop or at the forefront
2980929 does an increase in the inflation rate cause government officials to clamp down on the kinds of reforms that have so benefited chinas economy
2980930 the jaap stam match was a surprise for me too the speed is still there and everything went really easy
2980931 im retired for four years now and i train only once a week but you can achieve a lot when you really want it thats what i want to add to the team together with my experience
2980932 the main reason for my comeback is that i want to help the club but its nice to play again too
2980933 i spoke to united boss sir alex ferguson and he said i want you to go to blackburn it will be a good opportunity for you so im just over the moon
2980934 it is a big club it has got a big history theyve won the premier league in the past and with paul ince as a manager as a boy i used to watch him playing for manchester united
2980935 if marchisio does not recover candreva will be called up
2980936 id love to win the champions league with chelsea it would be fantastic because i know how much chelsea want to win this competition everyone here wants to win titles and that is why i chose to join the club
2980937 chelsea has a lot of quality and i think we have everything necessary to win the champions league and also the premier league
2980938 it was difficult for the two 17 year olds they want to impress but theyre playing against experienced players
2980939 theyve got to learn where to go not where the opposition want them to go at 17 theres loads of room for improvement
2980940 he made a decision he didnt want to sign a new contract so we have to look on
2980941 we have had offers that didnt match our valuation but there has been one where he didnt want to move north and as for forests supposed 2million bid ive not heard that
2980942 if ben has not gone by the end of the transfer window in three weeks there are opportunities for him within the fold

2980946 der nachteil beim nachtanken ist doch dass es vom eigentlichen rennen ablenkt
2980947 dadurch wird das rennen zu einer reihe von sprints wo man mit fast leerem tank unterwegs ist als man noch seine gesamte spritladung an bord hatte nahm der fahrer noch eine viel gr ere rolle ein
2980948 ich hatte keinen crash sondern bin einfach nur falsch gelandet ich wei gar nicht ob mein fu von der raste gerutscht ist aber es f hlt sich schon bel an ich bin entt uscht weil ich die saison eigentlich jetzt stark zu ende fahren m chte ich kann es eigentlich kaum noch abwarten den neuen asphalt in br nn auszuprobieren
2980949 in den vergangenen jahren ist der asphalt dort wirklich gealtert es gab zwar nicht viele wellen aber er wurde immer rauer und brach an manchen stellen auf mit der neuen oberfl che wird es bestimmt toll ich habe geh rt dass sie nicht einfach nur eine neue schicht aufgetragen haben sondern es von grund auf neu gemacht haben das wird sich nat rlich auf die reifenabnutzung auswirken wir m ssen diesbez glich auf alles vorbereitet sein
2980950 wir kommen also erstmals mit unserem neuen motor auf eine strecke wo wir die vorteile voll ausspielen k nnen br nn hat aber auch von allem etwas man kann sein motorrad dort nicht nur f r einen speziellen bereich abstimmen man braucht gute traktion um gut aus den ecken auf die geraden beschleunigen zu k nnen vor allem auf dem st ck bergauf zu den letzten beiden kurven man braucht aber auch stabilit t beim anbremsen weil es viele harte bremszonen gibt
2980951 die ferien haben es erm glicht dass ist mich ausruhen und auskurieren konnte ich hoffe dass in br nn alles okay sein wird mein arzt hatte mir nach laguna seca gesagt dass ich noch eineinhalb wochen ruhe brauchen w rde ich konnte nicht trainieren also habe ich ein paar sch ne tage auf mallorca genossen
2980952 mir wurden in barcelona die f den an der hand gezogen und danach begann die rehabilitation die hand tut zwar noch weh aber das gelenk kann ich gut bewegen und die finger sind nicht mehr geschwollen der fu ist noch getaped damit ich es nicht zu sehr bewege
2980953 ich hoffe ich kann mit einem guten rennen in br nn in den n chsten teil der saison starten
2980954 br nn ist eine sch ne strecke mit tollen passagen die bergauf und bergab gehen wie bei einer klassischen rennstrecke der kurs ist recht schnell mit sch nen kurven und einigen geraden auf der strecke musst du sanft und pr zise fahren und nicht zu aggressiv sie ist neu asphaltiert worden also m ssen wir erst einmal abwarten wie viel grip es dort gibt es herrscht dort immer eine gute stimmung das setup dort sofort passend hinzubekommen ist eine gro e herausforderung weil man einen guten kompromiss aus bremsstabilit t und lenkfreudigkeit braucht
2980955 the police and military need to act differently they have stony faces theyre seriously scaring the foreigners in beijing something has to be done

2980957 chinese journalists have rights to cover the olympic games their rights are protected by the chinese constitution
2980958 they have been saying how much china has improved and it showed today
2980959 it was a magical and memorable spectacle and a great way to start the beijing olympics
2980960 it was really unexpected that li ning would run in the air around the stadium
2980961 and it was amazing that the main torch could be designed so beautifully with chinese characteristics
2980962 i want to have fun life aint no dress rehearsal i want to have fun im a comedian i aint no politician so everything i do is with humor with love i aint trying to i aint running for office i aint running for nothing only thing i want to do is entertain the people i want them to be proud when they leave and they can recite something that i said or tell a joke that i told ive done my job
2980963 hes from chicago and he showed he can make it if you push yourself
2980964 i think it is dangerous to confuse the idea of democracy with elections just because you have elections doesnt mean youre a democratic country
2980965 the bible contains six admonishments to homosexuals and 362 admonishments to heterosexuals that doesnt mean that god doesnt love heterosexuals its just that they need more supervision

2980994 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
2980995 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
2980996 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
2980997 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
2980998 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
2980999 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
2981000 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
2981001 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
2981002 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas

2981009 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
2981010 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
2981011 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
2981012 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
2981013 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
2981014 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos

2981055 powerful nigerian politicians are seeking to derail attempts to fight high level corruption by weakening the main anti graft agency and hounding nuhu ribadu its former head officials within the unit have warned
2981056 the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals say that the new leadership of the economic and financial crimes commission efcc has removed dozens of senior investigators from cases against seven former state governors charged last year with looting public funds
2981057 the view is that of a total takeover of the levers of control by the people who are supposed to be on trial said one efcc official
2981058 mr ribadu who led the efcc after its establishment in 2003 under olusegun obasanjo the former president is regarded at home as the first nigerian to have struck fear into a political class estimated to have stolen billions of dollars of public funds accrued mainly from the countrys oil wealth
2981059 abroad he is respected for having led an unprecedented campaign to prosecute theft of government money and for collaborating with foreign police forces to curtail the e mail scams and fraud for which nigeria had become infamous
2981060 but the softly spoken police officer whose modest lifestyle contrasted with that of many of his targets also attracted fierce criticism
2981061 the efcc is one of several institutions promoted by the former government as the face of a new nigeria to have been shaken up since umaru yaradua became president in may last year
2981062 we have other issues to take up with the police service commission we are alarmed that about 40 of the demoted officers compared to nine from the north come from the south west zone which means they are all yoruba
2981063 we want to be convinced that this is not another continuation of geographical manipulations to ensure that a certain ethnic stock continues to take all the sensitive positions in the force now and in the future
2981064 that makes it clear that the targets of the russian military were not only georgian economic objects but international objects on georgian territory

2981075 focusing on one possible distraction could very well create a false sense of security
2981076 it would be most effective to look at all the possible problems that can arise in situations that drivers could be confronted with and deal with them comprehensively
2981077 that i think is what pushed us over to decide that its not a question of hands free or hand held
2981078 its just a question of talking on a cell phone
2981079 to take into account the studies that conclude that it is a distraction and to ignore those that would conclude the contrary doesnt do the whole debate justice
2981080 to look at one potential behavior and highlight it and ignore dozens of others that are extremely common is not dealing with this situation as effectively as it could be
2981081 im not sure that any law can be too strict when youre talking about protecting the children in these school zones
2981082 it just doesnt seem to be overly burdensome to say please hold on put down the phone
2981083 weve had a lot of near misses reported to us
2981084 so we started doing a little bit of on site research on our school just looking at it sure enough it was a true issue a true problem
2981085 we know the terrain we are familiar with the boundaries of wildlife refuges where spraying of insecticides is prohibited and we have a fleet of specialized crop dusting aircraft
2981086 if we had jumped the gun and hired someone we might have been stuck with a 2 2 million bill and not gotten any reimbursement
2981087 while county officials were holding meetings to find a way to get the state or federal government to pay for it citizens were being tormented by mosquitoes
2981088 they didnt start spraying until 10 days after the hurricane
2981089 we use gps we fly early in the morning and late in the evening a dead mosquito is a dead mosquito we kill them just as dead
2981090 i guess the truth is going to come out one way or another and i can vindicate myself
2981091 i didnt know it was going to take this long
2981092 as far as i know hes still on the payroll so a lot of people are interested on what way its going to go i think people are ready for it to be settled one way or another so we can go forward
2981093 its dragged on so long its time for this thing to come to a conclusion

2981096 bosnya thai suzuki telah datang ke sini meminta tambahan pasokan menjadi 1 500 2 000 unit apv per bulan karena mereka kewalahan melayani peningkatan permintaan
2981097 saat ini pembelian mobil apv di thailand masa tunggunya sampai enam bulan namun kami belum bisa menambah pasokan karena harus menyiapkan berbagai hal mulai dari sdm sumber daya manusia bahan baku dan pendukung lainnya
2981098 thailand memang negara mobil pick up karena pasar mobil di sana 70 persen pick up pick up kami suzuki apv dianggap murah dan daya angkutnya kuat sedangkan pick up sebenarnya mesin di depan harganya dua kali dari kami punya apv sehingga konsumen di negara tersebut mau beli mobil tersebut
2981099 makanya bos thai suzuki datang ke sini mau lihat langsung mereka tidak percaya karena mengira kapasitas produksi apv mencapai 7 000 unit per bulan
2981100 saat ini kami sudah beroperasi secara maksimal dengan meningkatkan lembur untuk menambah shift berarti harus tambah tenaga kerja dan dalam keadaan undang undang perburuhan seperti sekarang makin banyak karyawan itu momok karena kewajiban sosialnya menurut saya agak ekstrim sehingga harus diubah uu ketenagakerjaan

2981108 it might seem odd that one of the goals of britains biggest branded truck company is to get trucks off the road but that is exactly what we are trying to do
2981109 it seems ironic that we are now looking to revive more traditional modes of transport but new pressures such as congestion rising fuel prices and the environment mean the old methods are becoming viable again

2981114 one of our central tasks is the creation of the post oil megacity
2981115 i find that the sensation of myself as an ego inside a bag of skin is really a hallucination what we really are is first of all the whole of our body and although our bodies are bounded with skin and we can differentiate between outside and inside they cannot exist except in a certain kind of natural environment obviously a body requires air and the air must be within a certain temperature range the body also requires certain kinds of nutrition so in order to occur the body must be on a mild and nutritive planet with just enough oxygen in the atmosphere spinning regularly around in a harmonious and rhythmical way near a certain kind of warm star that arrangement is just as essential to the existence of my body as my heart my lungs and my brain so to describe myself in a scientific way i must also describe my surroundings which is a clumsy way getting around to the realization that you are the entire universe however we do not normally feel that way because we have constructed in thought an abstract idea of our self

2981143 i knew i was going to have to swim out of my mind
2981144 i had more adrenaline going than ive ever had in my life
2981145 its an unreal feeling because ive been part of the last two olympic relays that we came in silver and bronze in 2000 and 2004 and america has a great tradition of winning that relay we were the favorites both of those years and this year we were actually considered the underdog i still cant believe we all did as well as we did

2981154 but it was a great experience and i really enjoyed myself i had so much fun out there thats all you can ask getting the experience we just had a bad day i tried to not make it feel different but there was lots of pressure on me and i was very nervous it was there for the taking but it wasnt my day today now im looking at 2012 like ive always said
2981155 and i hope he takes a lot of experience from this and that it stands him in good stead unfortunately i dont have another chance

2981180 its really important for future presidents to understand the relationship between china and the region and its important to make sure that america is engaged with china even though we may have some disagreements
2981181 i think you ought to look at the relationship as one of constructive engagement where you can find common areas like north korea and iran but also be in a position where they respect you enough to listen to your views on religious freedom and political liberty
2981182 it gave me a chance to say to the chinese people religion wont hurt you you ought to welcome religious people

2981210 we were worried he might get a few kicks in the championship but he dealt with that
2981211 from day one when he came into training there were little cheeky nutmegs and stuff like that
2981212 initially when he was hospitalized we expected him to come back home but as the weeks went on i kind of knew
2981213 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
2981214 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
2981215 i kind of figured he was going to get a lot of backlash
2981216 telling that joke at that time probably wasnt the best idea but thats him
2981217 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
2981218 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family

2981304 much to our surprise the reaction of a membrane anchored prion protein differs from that of a prp in solution unstructured parts of the protein fold in a manner that makes it easy for another prion protein to be adsorbed the possible onset of the pathogenetic structure
2981305 high concentrations of prion protein at the membrane result in unstructured parts of the prion protein folding in a manner that makes it easy for numerous prion proteins to be adsorbed so called beta sheets comparable with two corrugated iron sheets develop enabling easy and perfectly fitting anchorage of the proteins

2981308 we wanted to produce a large number of disease models for ourselves our collaborators and the stem cell research community to accelerate research
2981309 the original embryonic stem cell lines are generic and allow you to ask only basic questions but these new lines are valuable tools for attacking the root causes of disease our work is just the beginning for studying thousands of diseases in a petri dish
2981310 the core will also function as a technical laboratory to produce these disease specific lines for use by scientists around the world
2981311 the suite of ips cell lines reported by the daley group marks an important achievement and a very significant advance for patients suffering from degenerative diseases these disease specific ips cells are invaluable tools that will allow researchers to watch the development diseases in petri dishes outside of the patients and we have good reason to believe that this will make it possible to find new treatments and eventually drugs to slow or even stop the course of a number of diseases in years ahead
2981312 this report will be seen as opening the door to a new approach to develop therapies
2981313 one of our goals in creating the nih directors pioneer award programs was to enable exceptionally creative scientists to move quickly in promising new directions thereby speeding the intellectual and technical breakthroughs needed to address major challenges in biomedical or behavioral research
2981314 this is certainly the case for drs daley and hochedlinger who deployed their directors award resources to advance our ability to use induced pluripotent stem cells for disease specific studies and drug development
2981315 the cell lines available from the ips core will allow stem cell researchers around the world to explore possible gene therapies for some conditions and will aid in the development of drugs for others

2981333 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2981334 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2981335 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2981336 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2981337 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2981338 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2981340 bill gates will demo a new multi touch computer and interface today called touchwall at the microsoft ceo summit in redmond touchwall refers to the touch screen hardware setup itself the corresponding software to run touchwall which is built on a standard version of vista is called plex
2981341 i think that microsoft surface really does strip the whole idea of usable multi point touch screen technology right back to the very idea which is letting the objects be the focus be they photographs music video actual items on the surface of the touch screen itself such as cameras and mobile phones
2981342 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2981343 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2981347 but as the weeks went on i kind of knew
2981348 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
2981349 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
2981350 its just sensible what are you doing to do fight back and get knifed
2981351 its probably something that many men do not admit i dont mind saying that its happened so many times and i always feel scared
2981352 my problem isnt more important than anyone elses just because im an actor and im also not afraid to say that it is more of a problem in latin america

2981356 i was warned our meeting wouldnt take long but i thought that would mean 30 minutes
2981357 instead he spoke to me for just 40 seconds it was the shortest meeting ive ever had with a director
2981358 i didnt think i would want to get married but i am excited about it
2981359 getting engaged can be very liberating because all the insecurities about your relationship go because youve made a commitment once youve made that commitment in anything then really magical things can happen
2981360 im inspired by women in music who manage to juggle family and a career i certainly dont want to stop touring

2981396 i sell swimming pool equipment for a living and we had been juggling the ideas of a swimming pool or a theater we figured we could do either for about the same amount of money
2981397 the only difference with a home theater is that i could do a lot of the work myself which would save us a little so we decided to go with the theater
2981398 it was not an enclosed room you could look right down the stairwell
2981399 i did a lot of research online to figure out where i wanted to go with the theater
2981400 and for a year my wife didnt see me as i isolated myself up there
2981401 i could have figured out the equipment installation myself but magnolias fees were minimal compared to the amount of time they actually spent with me

2981409 the rolex swan cup is always a great event that captures the true spirit of swan since our first rolex swan cup in 2000 the racing has become more intense and weve gone from sailing a swan 80 to a club swan 42 the club swan 42 class is fast and challenging and im looking forward to racing against the usa contingent weve enjoyed some good form recently and hope to repeat the performance in porto cervo we plan to head out to sardinia in the weeks leading up to the event to familiarise ourselves with the waters and get some practice in

2981424 standard dvd didnt require the purchase of a new tv either in contrast while half of the respondents to our survey rated quality as much better than standard dvd another 40 per cent termed it only somewhat better and most are very satisfied with the performance of their current dvd players
2981425 a higher percentage of methodists are saved than are roman catholics
2981426 virtually everyone not belonging to a church congregation was counted among the lost

2981430 and ye my flock the flock of my pasture are men and i am your god
2981431 and ye my sheep the sheep of my pasture are men you are called men but the idolaters are not called men
2981432 only an israelite who as a worshipper of the true god can be said to have been like adam created in the image of god idol worshippers having marred the divine image forfeit all claim to this appellation
2981433 in contrast to cattle idolaters also may be described as
2981434 models that attempt to explain altruistic behavior in terms of natural selection are models designed to take the altruism out of altruism
2981435 the man shall be put to death all the congregation shall stone him with stones outside the camp

2981440 the sons of israel learned many bad things from the goyim
2981441 i think it is not good since the arabs are
2981442 contrary to our expectation there was no difference concerning this most cruel form of prejudice between male and female examinees
2981443 suppose that the israeli army conquers an arab village in battle do you think it would be good or bad to act towards the inhabitants as joshua did towards the people of jericho
2981444 i think it would be good as we want our enemies to fall into our hands enlarge our frontiers
2981445 poor joshua glorious joshua he was forced to win so many battles with
2981446 all the kingdoms from the euphrates to the land of the philistines and to the border of egypt
2981447 this woman said to me give your son that we may eat him today and we will eat my son tomorrow so we boiled my son and ate him and on the next day i said to her give your son that we may eat him but she has hidden her son

2981452 o woman great is your faith be it done for you as you desire
2981453 go nowhere among the gentiles and enter no town of the samaritans but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of israel

2981456 lord will you at this time restore the kingdom to israel

2981459 our culture is superior because our religion is christianity and that is the truth that makes men free
2981460 my freedom to swing my arms about stops at the point of anothers nose
2981461 and if real peace does come to israel the question will be asked can we and how do we survive without an external enemy
2981462 all forms of evolved altruism must be discriminate in terms of costs and benefits the benefits must outweigh the costs and both must be measured in terms of reproduction of the altruists genes
2981463 you must proscribe them the hittites and the amorites the canaanites and
2981464 you shall utterly destroy them the hittites and the amorites the canaanites and
2981465 no human being who has been proscribed can be ransomed he shall be put to death
2981466 when a man causes a disfigurement in his neighbor as he has done it shall be done to him life for life eye for eye tooth for tooth

2981477 if you shall hear in one of your cities wicked persons have gone out from among you saying let us go and serve other gods you shall surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword destroying it utterly and all that is in it
2981478 thus says the lord god of israel put every man his sword by his side and slay every man his brother and every man his friend and every man his relative
2981479 from where is it derived that even a gentile who studies
2981480 the pious of the nations of the world will inherit a portion in the hereafter
2981481 even a pagan sic who studies the torah of moses may be considered in the category of a high priest
2981482 a noahide non jew who kills a person even if he kills an embryo in the mothers womb is put to death so too if he kills one suffering from a fatal disease he is put to death in none of these cases is an israelite put to death

2981489 its really important for future presidents to understand the relationship between china and the region and its important to make sure that america is engaged with china even though we may have some disagreements
2981490 i think you ought to look at the relationship as one of constructive engagement where you can find common areas like north korea and iran but also be in a position where they respect you enough to listen to your views on religious freedom and political liberty
2981491 it gave me a chance to say to the chinese people religion wont hurt you you ought to welcome religious people

2981551 the lord of the rings the return of the king
2981552 its almost unheard of summer doesnt usually afford films that much of a wide open playing field
2981553 it has taken on a life of its own and in doing so got so much positive press and word of mouth that older audiences who normally dont rush out to see movies or maybe only see two three movies a year are coming out in large numbers
2981554 its a question of weve been reading about this for three four weeks now
2981555 quite frankly its nice to know that everything else is still kind of doing some business
2981556 were so very satisfied to be at 40 million plus after five days you couldnt ask for more
2981557 theres been a rush to small cars but that doesnt necessarily mean its permanent in its extent and in fact our data shows that the tremendous sensitivity consumers have toward gas prices still goes both ways
2981558 theres already been an abatement of a pattern that many people in june were announcing was permanent automakers made some big changes in their production plans based on what happened just during the second quarter
2981559 and so while clearly the long term trend in gasoline prices is still upward
2981560 our data certainly calls into question whether the shift in buying patterns weve seen will even hold up during a few weeks of declining gas prices
2981561 these consumers appear to be feeling less pressure to cross shop more fuel efficient segments and are shifting slowly back to previous shopping patterns
2981562 consumers went into a state of shock when gas prices went over 4 a gallon and kept going and this kind of shock induced behavior cant sustain itself over a long period of time so consumers began to get used to those prices
2981563 ready to get out of their escalades and jump into civics when they actually may have needed some of that space they had in the suv
2981564 it looks like some of the recent consideration changes may be due to this factor
2981565 but that doesnt appear to be the driving force as evidenced by the fact that many vehicles with large incentive increases continue to register drops in consideration
2981566 of course no one wants to stick his head in the sand
2981567 the industry recognizes that higher gas prices are a long term trend even though prices in the short term may have overshot so im not sure what the model mix really will look like a year from now
2981568 but whats going on now points to a bigger truth
2981569 instability in the marketplace is probably the one thing that were absolutely going to have to get used to
2981570 how can they deny a persons right to their own property
2981571 guess how i got out i climbed out the window
2981572 controls are too much fun to waste on just one set of game rules
2981573 the size and discount of that type of deal isnt the norm yet
2981574 the critical mass of bulk reo is in well capitalized institutions that dont need to sell yet in bulk at a deep discount because they are better off not taking substantial hits to the capital just to get the assets off their books
2981575 this type of bulk buy would make an impact on the market they are in a unique position because they have a long time horizon to invest and a cheap cost of capital its actually a perfect time for them to acquire these reo assets
2981576 i must be scaring the shit out of every other woman on the floor
2981577 im so glad thats over im so glad thats over

2981590 the loss of isaac hayes less than 24 hours after bernie mac represents a major double blow to the entire entertainment industry black hollywood in particular

2981610 this does not mean that everyone with gerd is going to develop asthma by any means
2981611 but it may mean that people with gerd may be more likely to develop asthma if there is an upside to this it is that developing gerd is something we can pretty much treat and control
2981612 people should avoid the risk factors for gerd we strongly believe that the rise is asthma particularly among adults in the country is in large measure due to lifestyle choices that can be changed

2981617 all i need is some tasty waves a cool buzz and im fine
2981618 according to a survey of commodity brokerage firms last week by dow jones newswires grain analysts expect the usda to forecast that u s farmers will harvest 11 94 billion bushels of corn this year down from the record 13 07 billion bushels harvested last year
2981619 during the height of the flooding which swamped parts of iowa illinois wisconsin and missouri some analysts figured corn farmers might be able to produce only about 11 billion bushels
2981620 corn prices have since eased about 2 a bushel because weather conditions turned nearly ideal for plant growth after the june deluge ended yet corn prices remain twice as high as what they were for much of the decade amid booming demand from ethanol fuel manufacturers before the flooding many analysts had expected corn farmers to produce more than 12 2 billion bushels
2981621 analysts expect the usda to predict that farmers will harvest nearly three billion bushels of soybeans compared with the 2 59 billion bushels harvested last year u s farmers planted soybeans on more acres this year in hopes of capitalizing on rising prices
2981622 nass personnel re interviewed approximately 9 000 farmers in flood affected areas who had previously reported their planted acreage to the agency in early june prior to the majority of the flooding these re interviews were conducted in mid july allowing time for flooded fields to dry and for farmers to fully assess their 2008 cropping options additionally nass increased the number of corn and soybean fields selected for objective field measurements in the flood affected areas the agency also increased the sample size for the agricultural yield survey through which farmers report expected crop yields
2981623 after a sharp jump in the dollar once again lessened the appeal of commodities as a hedge against the weakening currency
2981624 for agriculture prices in particular the rising dollar means that u s grain exports to regions such as china and europe which have seen healthy crops of their own will likely slow down
2981625 wheat for september delivery dropped 57 cents to settle at 7 65 a bushel on the chicago board of trade corn for december delivery fell 23 75 cents to 5 18 and november soybeans fell 58 5 cents to 11 80 a bushel
2981626 for the week wheat fell 3 6 percent corn dropped 11 4 percent and soybeans tumbled 13 5 percent
2981627 high grain prices caused by burgeoning world demand forced lawmakers to make a major change in farm legislation using adjustments in the conservation provisions the 2008 bill encourages farmers to produce more crops and keep fewer acres idle
2981628 the farm bill reflects a shift to spend more money directly on working lands and it places less emphasis on set aside programs such as the farm bills traditional conservation anchor program the
2981629 a large part of the push for stewardship payments comes from philosophy and trade
2981630 trading partners view most u s commodity programs as trade distorting but those arguments cant be made with conservation payments
2981631 throughout the farm bill debate sen tom harkin d iowa constantly commented that farm payments should not be based on what farmers grow but how they grow
2981632 criticized for being too complicated the csp was retooled and renamed the conservation stewardship program it expanded to help more farmers who are conscious stewards of their working lands over the life of the new farm bill the csp will become usdas largest conservation program on a per acre basis the program which had roughly 15 5 million acres entering this summer will grow by more than 60 million acres through 2013
2981633 the 2008 enacted farm bill food conservation and energy act of 2008 p l 110 246 reauthorizes almost all existing conservation programs modifies several programs and creates various new conservation programs a new conservation stewardship program replaces the existing conservation security program and a new agricultural water enhancement program under the environmental quality incentives program is also authorized with mandatory funding other new programs include the chesapeake bay watershed program and a sodsaver provision to help preserve native sod including virgin prairie in the prairie pothole national priority area significant modifications to existing programs include a reduction of the maximum enrolled acreage under the conservation reserve program to 32 million acres and an increase in the cap for the wetlands reserve program to over 3 million acres
2981634 estimated new spending on the conservation title not including estimated conservation related revenue and cost offset provisions in the bill is projected to increase by 2 7 billion over 5 years and 4 0 billion over 10 years total mandatory spending for the conservation title is projected at 24 3 billion over 5 years fy2008 fy2012 and 55 2 billion over 10 years fy2008 fy2017
2981635 agricultural conservation became a significant and visible policy focus in the food security act of 1985 since then questions and concerns about conservation program funding policy objectives individual program effectiveness comparative geographic emphasis and the structure of federal assistance have been recurring issues in the debate shaping each successive omnibus farm bill the 2008 farm bill is no exception these long standing issues arguably became even more apparent in this farm bill as they found their way into many individual program changes this result may be a continuation of the more active profile taken by many conservation groups and their supporters in the 2002 farm bill unlike commodity programs conservation program participation tends to be well represented by small and mid size farming operations according to the united states department of agricultures usda economic research service the programs also enjoy wider public support in an environment of pronounced domestic budget constraint however conservation groups and producers found themselves competing with other farming interests for the necessary resources to expand and continue many conservation programs budget concerns aside several other issues emerged in the debate leading to enactment of the 2008 farm bill funding priorities and payment structure geographic targeting program complexity the importance of large scale conservation efforts and measurement of costs and effectiveness these general policy issues in various forms raised questions central to the deliberations and outcomes in the enacted conservation title of the farm bill
2981636 the new csp beginning in 2009 will continue to encourage conservation practices on working lands but will be different from the former program
2981637 rather than the three tier payment system payments for new csp contracts will be based on meeting or exceeding a stewardship threshold the level of resource conservation and environmental management required to improve and conserve the quality and condition of at least one resource concern
2981638 the bill sets a target of enrolling 12 8 million acres annually under the new csp individual producer payments are limited to 200 000 in any 5 year period per entity rather than annual sign ups for the program csp enrollment will be contracted on a continuous basis the type of eligible lands is expanded to include priority resource concerns as identified by states certain private agricultural and forested lands and also some nonindustrial private forest lands limited to not more than 10 of total annual acres under the program technical assistance will also be provided to specialty crop and organic producers along with a pilot testing of producers who engage in innovative new technologies or participate in on site conservation research producers may also receive supplemental payments for resource conserving crop rotations that provide specific environmental benefits such as improving soil fertility thus reducing the need for irrigation program payments may not be used for the design construction or maintenance of animal waste storage or treatment facilities or associated waste transport or transfer devices
2981639 a little publicized part of the new farm bill could potentially cut off government payments to thousands of farmers with small base acreages
2981640 but opponents of the measure including the pennsylvania farm bureau pfb believe its full implementation would be the result of a flawed reading of the farm bill on the way small plots are allowed to be combined
2981641 the new provision in the farm bill prohibits direct payments counter cyclical payments or average crop revenue election payments if the sum of the base acres on the farm is 10 acres or less
2981642 in pennsylvania alone about 11 300 farms enrolled last year had 10 or less base acres 31 percent of enrolled farms in the state according to richard pallman head of the usda farm service agency in pennsylvania
2981643 pallman said that the new farm bill measure will hurt farmers in pennsylvania but he also said that the total amount of payments to farms with 10 or fewer base acres is a fraction of total payments
2981644 according to pfb president carl shaffer the issue goes beyond farms of 10 acres or less
2981645 a common situation in pennsylvania is farmers planting multiple plots with fewer than 10 base acres each pallman said he made a rough estimate that the hardest hit of these farmers would lose about 1 500 in annual payments under the new law
2981646 pfb believes that the original intent of the measure was to allow farms with 10 or fewer base acres to be aggregated or combined with any farm or farms with base acres whether owned or rented to exceed 10 acres
2981647 but according to pallman the law is clear that the only way farm base acreages can be consolidated is through land purchase
2981648 the bush administration is prohibiting small farmers from combining their farm acreages so that they have the total of 11 acres required to qualify for farm subsidies under the new farm bill even though congress specifically included such aggregations in the bill according to the american farm bureau federation and congressional farm leaders
2981649 aides to house agriculture chairman collin peterson d minn senate agriculture chairman tom harkin d iowa and senate finance ranking member charles grassley r iowa confirmed today that producers have been complaining to members offices that usda is not permitting any reorganizations
2981650 the collapse of the recent ministerial meeting in the doha round of world trade talks was one of those occasions when most politicians want to keep out of the headlines
2981651 the failure of the meeting was a serious defeat for trade and for international development
2981652 this transformation of the eus role in world trade organisation wto negotiations is due in large measure to reforms of the common agricultural policy cap
2981653 the cap has now moved on dramatically following successive reforms the vast majority of support paid to eu farmers now comes in the form of direct payments which are decoupled from production
2981654 decoupled payments leave farmers free to base production decisions on the market and therefore do not distort trade under wto rules by shifting the emphasis of the cap away from market management and towards decoupled payments the eu has given itself room to accept much tighter wto disciplines on its farm sector
2981655 as we decide the best way forward the eu will continue its domestic work of forging the cap into a policy tool for the 21st century one which addresses public concerns about a safe and secure food supply competitive farming care for the environment and vibrant rural areas
2981656 whatever the next decade may hold for the cap i am confident of this the days are over in which the cap acted as a brake on international trade talks as it showed last month in geneva the eu now has its foot firmly on the accelerator
2981657 its a safe bet most of the 6 billion people around the world are going about their business today oblivious to the fact that the world trade organizations doha round of free trade talks died last week the what theyd respond in befuddlement if asked
2981658 even people involved daily in ongoing international trade arent reacting much differently theyre buying and selling goods across borders and oceans dealing with the logistical complications of high oil prices currency fluctuations the price of labor unit cost quality control and the like
2981659 this doesnt mean that a successful completion of the doha talks wouldnt have mattered
2981660 i spent as much time with cindy in washington and arizona as our jobs would allow
2981661 i was separated from carol but our divorce would not become final until february of 1980

2981664 international players and participants have been registering eni emmanuel from berlin has indicated that he would like to put up a performance of his famous show black man in oyibo mans kitchen for either the opening or closing ceremony he is a very popular poet in the west and has been in touch with us we also have gurus like prof awam akpan who will be tagging along five other visual arts professors who want to be part of the summit
2981665 though we have received funding partnerships from various banks and automobile companies we are yet to announce the official bank and automobile company for the event we have a marketing specialist who will come up with a decision as to which to stick with on the basis of who offers the best deal cnn is even partnering with us for the event
2981666 because we need to talk and to know what we are doing right and not doing right we need also to compare notes that is why a lot of our artists in the diaspora have been challenged to return home to contribute we also know that we are making great waves abroad all these are being done but not documented so this summit which is the peak of the gathering will ensure proper documentation
2981667 this time we are focusing on the root of the nigerian art regarding the conference the presentation is for professionals in the fields who will be there to discuss thus we have selected professors and seasoned scholars to make presentations their papers are meant to generate further discussions all of which will be collated for publication
2981668 old middle age and the young are invited it spans across the past present and the future one of the bonuses of aresuva is that artists who have not had any exposure will get to be nurtured and in the future it will be said that these are seeds that sprouted from aresuva and so they can always make reference to aresuva as their springboard to success
2981669 we do not have a site that will best showcase a visual art exhibition of this magnitude be it furniture automobile or visual art so that if an artist decides to have an installation of ten cars or containers piled on top one another there is room to take them in that manner comfortably
2981670 nigerian art today with aresuva is no longer art for art sake or song and dance
2981671 the 133 participants would be taught background of the language alphabet and words formation time days weeks farm and home objects customs and traditions among other things

2981686 britains attitude to eating out has changed dramatically in recent times
2981687 as our working lives become ever more hectic and stressful we love nothing more than to relax with a glass of wine and a casual meal to unwind and dust off a busy day
2981688 despite the fact that the uk is facing challenging times ahead people are still eating out particularly in more casual establishments and this should stand the pub industry in good stead for the coming year
2981689 it is interesting that pubs are beginning to prioritise sourcing local products which beyond having a positive effect on image and brand is also better for the environment and can help businesses improve their bottom line through cheaper transportation costs

2981814 the recycled air from the air conditioner blowing right in my face my eyes closed as i sneeze from the dust stirred up from the bottom of the t shirt box the flaming pink color of the xl t shirt of whats her name again as i fold it and slip it into the envelope the florescent white lights beating me into submission while sitting on the floor
2981815 the residential roads of japans urban areas are a part of peoples living space and its impolite to photograph other peoples living spaces
2981816 for people living in urban areas in japan though the situation is quite the opposite the residential street in front of a house the so called alleyway feels more like a part of ones own living space like a part of the yard when we walk along an alleyway like that we dont stare and scrutinise the houses along the way it is for this reason i think that we have this awareness that peeping at these kinds of places is something that is actually quite rude
2981817 in our way of living you do not unilaterally and in a machine readable form lay open peoples living spaces to the whole world my request is thus to remove japanese residential streets from street view this will make the internet ever so slightly less convenient but for me that is no problem at all

2981839 these results show its possible to correct this protein logjam that occurs in our cells as we get older thereby perhaps helping us to enjoy healthier lives well into old age
2981840 its not often you see studies where they have managed to improve function in this way
2981841 what they seem to have managed is to maintain the mice at this young stage and both restore and maintain normal activity
2981842 as we age we have an increase in protein misfolding and general faults in protein processing so the ability to maintain an effective system to clear these would be beneficial

2981844 today when more children are overweight compared with previous generations it can be harder for parents to objectively identify if their child is overweight
2981845 research shows that most parents of overweight or obese children think that their child is a healthy weight some research showed that only 10 of parents with overweight or obese children described their child as overweight
2981846 preliminary findings of the survey suggest that many people who would be defined clinically as obese find the use of the term obese highly offensive and would stop listening to further advice
2981847 to shrink from using the word obesity is really ducking an issue
2981848 it does not have to be used in a judgmental or insulting way if a child is obese then the parents should know that its obese we must make parents know that the lifestyle of the family needs to be modified
2981849 risks and benefits of bmi reporting in the school setting
2981850 our feeling is that the information should be given to parents if there is a serious health concern much like any other health concern a child might have
2981851 this information should not be included on a report card or such medical information should be kept separate
2981852 the government must lead on action across society to tackle obesity engaging parents in this issue is essential to achieving success in instigating behavioral change

2981901 there are obvious benefits to shooting in hd and it certainly makes our archive more valuable with a longer lifespan and increased resale potential down rezed hd tends to look better than normal sd so we would hope that the level of our output would improve investing in sd equipment with a three year life expectancy at this stage would not be a great business decision to make for us in view of the opportunities to come out of our partnership with channel 4
2981902 as music broadcasters our core content is built around high quality music videos from the uk top 40 chart to videographies of global music talent to the ever popular hosted link and clip formats
2981903 we are not yet broadcasting in hd but it is important for us to be forward thinking and consider the archive value of the footage the workflow benefits of the tapeless xdcams was particularly appealing in our fast turnaround environment and the cameras will be used for all our programming and commercial acquisition mostly as a two camera shooting option
2981904 we liked its built in sd downconvert and the ability to use it as a regular vt with some slight speed benefits
2981905 the hd cameras open up exciting new creative avenues like using the oversized hd frames in an sd sequence for a promo where we can dve zoom in and out without any loss of picture quality the larger image sizes are also much more useful for print promotions and the creation of disaster recover archives should prove to be easier with this new format

2981909 traditional revenue sources will not be sufficient to fund games development
2981910 something is going to have to be there to make up the difference
2981911 perhaps not directly but this area can provide some sources of income which eventually be directed back to the developer

2981921 id like to say straightaway that regime change is an american expression
2981922 we do not use such an expression but sometimes there are occasions and we know from history that there are different leaders who come to power either democratically or semi democratically and they become an obstacle

2981939 these allegations are extremely troublesome and bring to light past domestic covert operations which were found to be not only unconstitutional but also damaging to the rule of law and americas democratic principles
2981940 i was shocked that the state of maryland would have that kind of activity going on
2981941 and it makes me wonder how all of this came about is this truly in the name of homeland security we must always protect our homeland but we must also at the same time protect our constitutional rights
2981942 the department of homeland security has for quite some time been seeking to enlist local law enforcement to become domestic surveillance agencies and has been pouring literally millions upon millions of dollars into them
2981943 these local agencies then have a need to justify the extraordinary amount of funding that they are getting and in the absence of actual terrorists they have to find a terrorist under every rock
2981944 in the future this certainly will not occur unless there is some sort of illegal activity or criminal nexus that is part of the investigation
2981945 there just wont be any intrusion unless that is present
2981946 most people would be upset to know that police were spying on lawful citizens and infiltrating peaceful organizations rather than chasing down real criminals
2981947 at a minimum such police spying is clearly a waste of taxpayer dollars and a diversion from the mission of protecting and serving the people
2981948 at a time when people across the united states believe their civil rights are being violated and question the credibility of our justice system it is imperative that we make clear that this behavior will not be tolerated
2981949 the breach of new zealand laws and sovereignty by agents of the israeli government has seriously strained our relationship with israel
2981950 this type of behaviour is unacceptable internationally by any country it is a sorry indictment of israel that it has again taken such actions against a country with which it has friendly relations
2981951 israel values its relations with new zealand very much and we will do everything we can to return relations to their former situation
2981952 israel is very sorry about the decision that was taken by the new zealand government
2981953 but we believe that if we will work one with each other as we used to work in the past we will overcome the last difficulty

2981968 since when has the anouncement of governments action made the announcer culpable even if it is the emir of my hometown who gets removed it is i who will be asked to announce it because it is my job much less an md of a parastatal adamu said the allegations were false
2981969 i have not heard of the reason why the government took that decision therefore i am not in the best position to conclude that there is any witch hunt or anything political about the changes but i believe it took that decision having the interest of the people of kaduna state at heart
2981970 the era of indolence and gossip is over and anybody who cannot go with this policy will be shown the way out with ignominy
2981971 there is no rift between governor sambo and senator makarfi
2981972 the former commissioner for agriculture did not even know makarfi as a politician
2981973 the former commissioner for land was removed for security reasons he was responsible for the crisis in barakallahu village which almost led to rioting by the villagers and when there is a problem in a place the head of the place should be held responsible and culpable for the problem the managing director of ksmc was not removed by the governor but by the commissioner for information who oversees his office he recommended his removal and the governor endorsed it that was all

2981976 our state of economy and health care system which are even encouraging the high prevalence
2981977 there is increasing migration to urban areas of mentally ill people from the villages because they feel they can get more alms or knick in knacks in the cities
2981978 so long as there is increased poverty and eroding extended family value system in nigeria we will continue to have increased cases of mentall ill people
2981979 there is extreme poverty in nigeria and poverty affects mental health in fact there is a direct relationship between poverty and mental health so the more we move to extreme poverty the more the cases of mental illness
2981980 nigeria used to be at a relatively low poverty scale but in the last four years we have plunged into extreme poverty so many more people are now poor without access to basic necessities of life like education housing transport health etc so we have drifted to the extreme poor country scale
2981981 as far as nigeria and many african countries continue to suffer from bad governance and poor leadership we will continue to have poor social health poor physical health and we will continue to have poor mental health as well
2981982 it is true there has been an increase in the presence of the vagrant mentally ill persons in the country that only the implementation of the policy on mental illness and passage of the bill on mental health by the national assembly would guarantee near compliance of keeping the destitute off the streets in nigeria
2981983 it is a reflection of what is happening in the society the countrys health status is in bad shape in countries like switzerland the health status is good and as such you dont find people with poor mental health roaming the streets
2981984 this does not portend well for the society it does not show we care enough for our people leaving them on the streets is not just right for a society that is serious about taking care of her people
2981985 to my expectation should have a case for the other two tiers of government on what to do in ameliorating the case of vagrant mentally ill persons
2981986 it should not be the government at the centre alone

2982005 we are only now able to discuss conditions based time horizons because security has improved so much this would not have been possible 18 months ago
2982006 we all look forward to the day when iraqi security forces take the lead on more combat missions allowing u s troops to serve in an overwatch role and more importantly return home
2982007 this was a heinous attack by al qaida in iraq against an iraqi family followed by a cowardly attack against innocent civilians their security forces and u s soldiers
2982008 i did not expect that a terrorist attack to take place in our secure town
2982009 al qaida is to blame for this attack operations in diyala have pushed them here

2982030 1and i stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy 2and the beast which i saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority 3and i saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the beast 4and they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast and they worshipped the beast saying who is like unto the beast who is able to make war with him 5and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months 6and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against god to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven 7and it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and nations 8and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world 9if any man have an ear let him hear 10he that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword here is the patience and the faith of the saints 11and i beheld another beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon 12and he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed 13and he doeth great wonders so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men 14and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast which had the wound by a sword and did live 15and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast that the image of the beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed 16and he causeth all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads 17and that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name 18here is wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is six hundred threescore and six
2982031 pledge allegiance to all white leadership who enspouse and embrace the white value system
2982032 only malcom xs autobiography seemed to offer something different his repeated acts of self creation spoke to me the blunt poetry of his words his unadorned insistence on respect promised a new and uncompromising order martial in its discipline forged through sheer force of will all other stuff the talk of blue eyed devils and apocalypse was incidental to that program
2982033 desperate times called for desperate measures and for many blacks times were chronically desperate if nationalism could create a strong and effective insularity deliver on its promise of self respect then hurt it might cause well meaning whites or the inner turmoil it caused people like me would be of little consequence
2982034 there is so much bickering and vile bloviating in the world it is starting to wear me down
2982035 you will hear of wars and rumors of wars see that you are not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom
2982036 there will be great earthquakes and plagues and famines here and there there will be fearful sights and great signs from heaven
2982037 see that you are not troubled for all these things must come to pass
2982038 not everyone who says to me lord lord shall enter the kingdom of heaven but he who does the will of my father in heaven
2982039 i am a child of god and you cannot touch me god will not allow it
2982040 for as in the days before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that noah entered the ark
2982041 and did not know until the flood came and took them all away so also will the coming of the son of man be
2982042 then two men will be in the field one will be taken and the other left
2982043 two women will be grinding at the mill one will be taken and the other left
2982044 watch therefore for you do not know what hour your lord is coming
2982045 but know this that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief would come he would have watched and not allowed his house to be broken into
2982046 therefore you also be ready for the son of man is coming at an hour you do not expect
2982047 realize that the inconsistancies and bullshit in the bible was brought about by man to explain the unexplainable
2982048 it has been said that mortals who hear the voice of god die because his voice is to much for mortal ears
2982049 whether or not he is elected president bho will be revealed to be the ac
2982050 that the message can wait would he like something to eat
2982051 he would like that very much and could i please also feed his grandson
2982052 i will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you and i will proclaim my name the lord in your presence i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i will have compassion 20 but
2982053 you cannot see my face for no one may see me and live
2982054 christians and catholics cant say any thing because their pope was a nazi and there is no way to atone for that
2982055 do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman that is detestable
2982056 i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me
2982057 who is like the beast and who can fight against it
2982058 must get you to believe your own lies to fool others into believing them
2982059 teach a child the ways he will go and when he is old he will not turn from them
2982060 a mouth speaking great things and blasphemes and was given authority to continue for 42 months 3 1 2 years then he opens his mouth in blaspheme against god to blaspheme his name his tabernacle and those who dwell in heaven it was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them and authority was given to him over every tribe tongue and nation all who dwell on earth will worship him
2982061 little children it is the last hour and as you have heard the anti christ is coming
2982062 and this is the anti christ which you have heard and now is already in the world they are of the world therefore they speak as of the world and the world hears them
2982063 that is why you are loved until you make a mistake then by by by into the skillet
2982064 blessed are those who do his commandments that they may have the right to the tree of life and may enter through the gates of the city but outside they should not come in are dogs and sorcerers and sexually immoral and murderers and idolaters and whoever loves and practices a lie
2982065 obama is a muslim and is probably the anti christ
2982066 obama may not be the anti christ but hes anti white
2982067 oh no what if a black man becomes president hell treat all the whites like weve been treating the blacks we must flee
2982068 please folks if you could just stop pushing theres a baby up here
2982069 man looks at the outward appearance but god looks at the heart
2982070 as devout as many muslims are do you think they would put anyone above allah how ridiculous like christains are the only religion believers who can be true to their faith
2982071 bho is a guy running for president he has the right to do so
2982072 how does that make you any better than the pagans
2982073 mabus then will soon die there will come of people and beasts a horrible rout then suddenly one will see vengence hundred hand thirst hunger when the comet will run
2982074 obama has never done anything to be considered evil so why do you think hes the anti christ
2982075 i cant do this alone we have to do this together
2982076 the idea of the ac being one person is relatively recent and i think the popularity of the left behind series has turned the search for the ac into a kind of hysteria
2982077 the idea of the ac being one person is relatively recent
2982078 we place a high value on hope and taking care of everyone we want to be involved in making our country a better place
2982079 the roman catholic church but what makes you think that they were the one true church that jesus and or the disciples established
2982080 bho is the ac because he has an eery felling about him
2982081 if any man lack wisdom let him ask of god
2982082 wow i forgot how many uneducated people there are in this world
2982083 so what if he brings change to the table isnt about time we allowed change to inter our lives
2982084 isnt the army of darkness already helping it through looking out for people who may unmask their leader and trying to hinder all interference
2982085 for the whole world is under the control of the evil one
2982086 love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man loves the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and the world will pass away and the lust thereof but he that does the will of the only true god will abide for ever
2982087 if you were of the world the world would love its own but because you are not of the world but i have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hates you remember the word that i said unto you the servant is not greater than his master if they have persecuted me they will also persecute you if they have kept my saying they will keep yours also
2982088 where do wars and fighting among you come from do they not come of your lusts that war in your members you lust and have not you kill and desire to have and cannot obtain you fight and war yet you have not because you ask not you ask and receive not because you ask amiss that you may consume it upon your lusts you adulterers and adulteresses dont you know that friendship with the world is to be at enmity with the only true god therefore whoever will be a friend of the world is the enemy of the only true god
2982089 the world cannot hate you but the world hates me because i testify that the works of this world are evil
2982090 the messiah gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from this present evil world according to the will of the only true god our father
2982091 if the world hates you know that it hated me before it hated you
2982092 has blinded the minds of those who believe not the messiah
2982093 imagination is destroying and perverting creation land air water creatures truth love peace faith simplicity etc
2982094 a love of the truth that they might be saved
2982095 a father unto them and they are his sons and daughters
2982096 the messiah was a servant of the only true god
2982097 to be a friend of this world is to be the enemy of the only true god
2982098 allow that woman jezebel which calls herself a prophetess to teach for she teaches others to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto idols the only true god gave her a chance to repent of her fornication and she repented not
2982099 and the only true god will destroy them who destroy the earth
2982100 the lust of the eye the lust of the flesh and the pride of life
2982101 they no longer love this wicked evil world and its things nor do they love their own lives in this world
2982102 love not the world neither the things that are in the world
2982103 let the woman learn in silence with all subjection for i suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence
2982104 for adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression
2982105 the only true god is the head of the messiah the messiah is the head of the man and the man is the head of the woman
2982106 morally and economically everything will fall into place for a prosperous nation
2982107 ive gotten a lot of questions the last few weeks asking if obama is the antichrist
2982108 i tell everyone that i dont think the antichrist will come out of politics especially american politics
2982109 i can see by the language he uses why people think he could be the antichrist
2982110 but from my reading of scripture he doesnt meet the criteria there is no indication in the bible that the antichrist will be an american
2982111 if even the people who created the character nicolae carpathia dont see the comparisons as warranted then perhaps this is overblown

2982117 die expertise der sechs antragsteller erg nzt sich hervorragend und die beteiligten wissenschaftler verstehen sich auch pers nlich sehr gut so dass ich erwarte dass die einrichtung der dfg forschergruppe eine ganze reihe produktiver kooperationen erm glichen wird
2982118 dies ist eine spannende zeit f r sybase seit mehreren jahren setzen wir unsere unwired enterprise strategie um und unsere rekord ergebnisse im jahr 2007 sowie im ersten halbjahr 2008 zeigen wie sehr sie angenommen wird
2982119 unternehmenskunden und mitarbeiter die einen freien zugriff in realtime auf informationen verlangen lassen die vision des unwired enterprise immer mehr zur realit t werden sybase ist einzigartig positioniert um die entsprechende infrastruktur zu liefern und diesen zugriff zu erm glichen durch unsere software f r analyse und mobilisierung sowie unsere netzwerk hubs
2982120 dies ist genau die umfassende vorkonfigurierte l sung die wir gesucht haben um unsere wachsenden datenmengen zu managen und zu analysieren
2982121 wir glauben dass die sybase analytic appliance sowohl bei der investition wie bei der laufenden wartung sehr kosteneffektiv ist
2982122 mit explodierenden datenvolumen die die performance durchschnittlicher data warehouses belasten entscheiden sich unternehmen f r die sybase analytic appliance um die last ihrer analysen zu verringern und dies in einer kosteneffektiven weise die zugleich einfach einzurichten und zu pflegen ist
2982123 with our existing one story house we have nowhere to go except the roof in case of a flood
2982124 the fema code is written in a way that you could have additions on the second floor as long as you dont expand the footprint of the house our code is stricter we dont allow any additions
2982125 we were in a dilemma in that if planners grant an exception then we would be violating our own code
2982126 it would be allowed because thats not going to impede the flow of water
2982127 we said wed write up a draft ordinance obviously we have to make sure fema is ok with it

2982130 afhankelijk van de opkomst in de nacht van zondag op maandag schatten we het bezoekersaantal tussen de 100 000 en de 110 000
2982131 ook over de drankverkoop zijn we bijzonder tevreden we hebben nog een feestnacht te gaan en hebben al meer drank verkocht dan vorig jaar de beste verkoop realiseerden we op de punkavond met het optreden van onder meer de sex pistols ook de eerste avond met milk inc was een groot succes qua publieksopkomst muzikaal verliep alles perfect met de programmatie zorgden we ervoor dat we ook succes kenden op avonden met mindere weersomstandigheden
2982132 i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
2982133 this suggests that the iphone calls home once in a while to find out what applications it should turn off at the moment no apps have been blacklisted but by all appearances this has been added to disable applications that the user has already downloaded and paid for if apple so chooses to shut them down
2982134 while there may well be some sort of kill switch that apple can deploy to remotely disable an app thats already installed this list is not it
2982135 it is not a blacklist for disabling apps completely but rather specifically for preventing any listed apps from accessing core location an api which for obvious privacy reasons is covered by very strict rules in the iphone sdk guidelines
2982136 it was an original idea from gordon and there has been a substantial personal contribution from him
2982137 he has approached several archbishops and other religious leaders for their views and ian rankin j k rowling and sir george martin are among the other contributors
2982138 its quite a wide list and the book is meant to reflect on the diversity of what it means to be british in the modern day
2982139 today its an amazing fact that 50 of scots have close relatives in england so it seems strange that people are talking of splitting up when theres such a level of connection at a human level at a family level with england
2982140 then youve got to look at what holds us together people say the empire the benefits of industrialisation the war years that we went through together i dont think thats the case
2982141 i think we share the same values about liberty about democracy about the need for social cohesion and for people to work together co operatively
2982142 i think we share respect for similar institutions like the health service
2982143 i wouldnt like to see health care denied to a scot in england or to an english person in scotland
2982144 i think the principle of the health service we all accept is the right to health care in any part of the united kingdom the right to work in any part of the united kingdom the right to attention no matter which part of the united kingdom you live in
2982145 for poor old gordon brown this may be too little too late
2982146 his britishness campaign has always been about him trying to sell himself to people south of the border especially middle england
2982147 koalitionen auf landesebene sind pragmatische konsequenzen aus wahlergebnissen sie pr judizieren nichts f r die bundesebene dies gilt besonders jetzt wo wir in deutschland ein f nf parteien system haben
2982148 das ist zun chst erstmal eine entscheidung der hessischen freundinnen und freunde wir sind bereit beratend und mit berlegungen zur seite zu stehen alles andere was an ffentlichen ratschl gen gegeben wird ist nicht ganz hilfreich
2982149 derjenige der seine verantwortung hingeschmissen hat und wieder das werden will was er schon einmal war der wird uns nicht so sehr aufregen

2982152 these dishes were to subtlety what paris hilton is to chastity
2982153 naast de prijs hebben we sterk gelet op de prestaties en kwaliteit daarbij speelde ook mee dat pqr het complete implementatietraject van nieuwe hardware en software voor zijn rekening neemt
2982154 we are really excited about this project because it gives victims an opportunity to ask questions get information and tell the offender how crime has affected their lives
2982155 crime can have a devastating effect on the lives of victims however restorative justice can help us come to terms with them and then move on
2982156 it can have a powerful healing affect in dispelling the myth of the offender and the reality of meeting that person can make things a lot less scary
2982157 it was part of the process it was the thing that opened the door for me once id sat and listened and spoke and engaged in conversation with the victims of crime and realised how they were feeling and what damage id done i knew things could never be the same again
2982158 coming face to face with victims of crime in my case two victims of burglaries id committed and suddenly feeling experienced in the pain and harm id caused it was more than just profit it was about how these people felt about the actual feelings id left them with

2982161 in de komende maanden verwachten we tekenen van een wijdverspreide verzwakking van de elektronische sector wat een direct resultaat kan hebben voor de verkoop van halfgeleiders
2982162 als de economische conjunctuur zich voortzet lijkt het ons moeilijk voor te stellen dat we geen significante afname zullen zien in de uitgaven aan elektronische apparatuur zelfs in de meest stabiele sectoren van de industrie
2982163 it wasnt an overdose i had a bad experience it was nowhere near an overdose it was blown completely out of proportion i never overdosed
2982164 drugs for me are something i dont normally meddle in i have tried drugs in my life im not going to deny it but i dont need to go to rehab because i never and will never have any sort of habit with drugs
2982165 its something that everyone well not everyone smart people usually dont do it but its something that people go through in their lives especially growing up in london and its not something ive ever had a problem with
2982166 i like miley she seems to have a sweet character
2982167 anyone we like or respect no matter how different they may be we would play with

2982211 as an evangelical i believe the roman church is a false church and it teaches a false gospel i believe the pope himself holds a false and unbiblical office
2982212 t he office the pope holds is an unbiblical institution based in a monarchial ministry that is incompatible with the new testaments vision of the church furthermore he claims also to be a head of state a situation that adds untold layers of additional confusion
2982213 he said he didnt want to hurt my feelings by being blunt but he said when hes alone with anita shes all over him and she comes on too strong
2982214 jake of course they do what the heck is the matter with you for even asking a question like that

2982223 such things as caring for ones self performing manual tasks walking seeing hearing speaking breathing learning and working
2982224 obviously hes the smartest and classiest man ive ever known ill never be so stupid again

2982300 id like for us to be really good on coverage in the preseason but were never going to be real good because ive got a lot of guys out there that are just learning their trade
2982301 its just a different philosophy if one of those rookies is going to have to be out there i want to give him as many reps in the preseason as i can
2982302 the rookies are not looking like rookies top draft pick lawrence jackson came up big against the run and also in his pass rush fullback owen schmitt showed he can run and catch and block and seventh rounder justin forsett was second in rushing with 55 yards on 13 carries
2982303 guess who was at right end with the no 1 defense this morning yes the teams first round draft choice from usc but he wasnt replacing incumbent starter darryl tapp because he slid to the left side to fill in for patrick kerney
2982304 as far as jacksons status goes its difficult to tell exactly what they have in mind when it comes to starters but whether he starts or not he will play a lot on the edge and inside his level of knowledge and instincts are much more mature than the average rookie and hell be a significant factor as dwaine board rotates his players to keep them fresh

2982385 it can have a powerful healing affect in dispelling the myth of the offender and the reality of meeting that person can make things a lot less scary
2982386 it was part of the process it was the thing that opened the door for me once id sat and listened and spoke and engaged in conversation with the victims of crime and realised how they were feeling and what damage id done i knew things could never be the same again
2982387 coming face to face with victims of crime in my case two victims of burglaries id committed and suddenly feeling experienced in the pain and harm id caused it was more than just profit it was about how these people felt about the actual feelings id left them with

2982404 carlos came to us a year ago straight after the copa america
2982405 his fitness now is light years ahead of where it was then and we are expecting big things from him the great thing about tevez is that he has a heart to play the game he is not intimidated at all he fights for every ball and is a real handful the decision to make him man of the match was fully justified it was a superb performance he was a constant thorn to portsmouth and it is just a pity he did not get a goal
2982406 speaking on behalf of his direct descendants were thrilled its being preserved
2982407 i think its a case of people recognizing him and taking a second look at what he did he was looked at as a quirky oddball
2982408 he was regarded as someone outside of the mainstream theres a lot more to bucky than the later part of his life he was creative and a true innovator of his time i think
2982409 the rules have changed now you are not allowed to have rings on so with one minute to go we had to saw it off

2982411 one of the lads cut it off but im not sure who it was to be honest
2982412 jim paterson was told to warm up because there was literally 10 seconds to go so it was good preparation for me really
2982413 i thought they were going to take his finger off as well they eventually got it off but they cut him
2982414 jim was on the pitch just as a precaution in case we couldnt get the ring off
2982415 i find it a zany rule but its a rule for everybody no jewellery is allowed to be worn at all
2982416 i would never have believed that anybody would make up a rule where eventually a hacksaw has to be used on somebodys finger
2982417 the rule now is black and white you are not allowed one piece of jewellery on your body
2982418 it has to come off even if the finger comes off with it
2982419 it defies logic to me but thats the rule the referee was standing there saying he cant go on he cant go on
2982420 lewes manager keehan revealed trialist shabazz baidoo formerly of queens park rangers had been recommended to him by danny cullip baidoo played the second half against havant on saturday

2982422 he did enough against havant for me to maybe want to see more
2982423 ive had a couple of chats with him and im still talking to him
2982424 at the moment its just if i can raise any more money really at the moment well go with the players weve got

2982436 there will likely be more money available from donor nations for irrigation research into new seed varieties and fertilizer donor nations need to assist ethiopia so that it becomes less reliant on rain fed agriculture to provide good harvests to feed its people

2982438 people are now more knowledgeable about where to get help the governments productive safety net program the stabilization centers and out patient therapeutic care sites mean that people have more options for support and are more knowledgeable about how to access the services and programs

2982488 flushing occurs because the vasomotor system the part of the brain that controls temperature in the body dilates your vessels veins and arteries to give the blood a bigger surface area and therefore cool it down
2982489 its called vasodilation and thats why you go red theres a bigger blood flow around the body
2982490 you flush if youre embarrassed because neurotransmitters in your brain signal this emotion and that causes the central nervous system to produce chemicals which make the vessels dilate
2982491 the hormone oestrogen regulates the hypothalamus which is the heat stabilisation centre in the brain so when your oestrogen is low it can cause hot flushes

2982545 the strength in the u s dollar has also been felt hardest in the precious metals complex with silver posting the largest week on week price decline in the sector
2982546 we expect further downside as we position for eurusd falling towards 1 45 in response to a deterioration in the outlook for euroland economic activity and an adverse shift in capital flows against the euro area

2982562 among others the grp milf moa creates a bangsamoro homeland with the bje bangsamoro juridical entity as the entity having authority and jurisdiction over the territory created and grants it with sovereign powers

2982606 the eucharist has given me a powerful experience of the universal and so to speak cosmic character yes cosmic because even when it is celebrated on the humble alter of a country church the eucharist is always in some way celebrated on the alter of the world it unites heaven and earth

2982610 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2982611 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2982612 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2982613 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

2982641 ik heb ooit eens een deal gesloten een keurige heer heeft me ooit eens aangeboden om me echt goed gitaar te leren spelen
2982642 ik was gek op muziek als klein kind al ik had een mondharmonica en daar kon ik wel aardig mee uit de voeten
2982643 son house zei dat ik mensen gek maakte met mn gepriegel en dat ik er niks van kon
2982644 op een avond stapte er een heer op me af hij had me zien spelen en zei dat hij me kon helpen om echt goed te worden hij wilde er iets voor terug iets dierbaars maar ik stemde toch toe hij nam me mee naar buiten stemde mijn gitaar en dat was het de rest van het verhaal dat met dat kruispunt heb ik zelf bedacht
2982645 het staat toch mooier om je ziel op een donker kruispunt te verkopen dan voor de deur van een bar met een paar glazen whisky achter je kiezen
2982646 ik werd er luidruchtig en enthousiast van vrouwen vonden dat leuk maar hun echtgenoten vaak minder
2982647 nou de hellhound die keurige meneer zat me op de hielen hij wilde dat ik mijn deel van onze afspraak zou nakomen en de tijd die me nog restte moest ik maar nuttig besteden vond ik
2982648 een andere heer sprak me aan in een juke joint hij had mijn optreden gehoord en was erg onder de indruk hij zei dat hij een goede bekende was van iemand die ik goed kende
2982649 hij wilde me helpen om aan hem te ontkomen en hij had een plan
2982650 dan kon de keurige meneer zoeken tot hij een ons woog maar vinden zou hij me nooit
2982651 deze man hij werkte voor een platenmaatschappij wist dat dit de toekomst zou zijn hij vertelde me dat mijn muziek en ik hiermee onsterfelijk zouden worden
2982652 ik ben altijd bang geweest voor technologie studios microfoons ik snapte er niets van en toen ik mijn eigen stem voor het eerst uit zon apparaat hoorde komen schrok ik me te pletter
2982653 alles heeft zijn prijs denk je niet ik ben van de ene meneer af maar ben bij een ander in de schuld komen te staan
2982654 vroeger wilde ik niet dat ze me op de foto zouden zetten want als je een foto van iemand maakt dan steel je zijn ziel
2982655 en wat je verliest als je iemand zijn stem opneemt is me inmiddels ook wel duidelijk geworden
2982656 at the time i was shaken up a bit but now im just trying to think clearly
2982657 were out of toilet paper and there are about 70 people lined up to use the bathroom
2982658 we continue to work closely with marc and we havent encountered any major impediments
2982659 the major issue we confront is honestly one of capacity and how do you provide additional service without degrading the service you already have
2982660 thats when they do a lot of the maintenance of their tracks
2982661 theyve been trying to work with us but theyve also been saying here are our issues
2982662 we have tried to get someone in there independently to see if theres anything we can suggest
2982663 its going to help with reliability and its also going to help with capacity

2982668 stamped on every page of her diaries and journals is a woman fully immersed in the practical realities of everyday living even as she is totally engaged in assimilating these realities through an eternal perspective it is from the tensions of these two realities the seen and the unseen that hard spiritual truths are hammered out
2982669 the need of deliberately holding back everything that would crowd our souls and stifle the freedom of gods light and air
2982670 jika tuhan menciptakan segalanya berarti tuhan menciptakan kejahatan karena kejahatan itu ada dan menurut prinsip kita bahwa pekerjaan kita menjelaskan siapa kita jadi kita bisa berasumsi bahwa tuhan itu adalah kejahatan
2982671 pertanyaan macam apa itu tentu saja dingin itu ada kamu tidak pernah sakit flu
2982672 kenyataannya pak dingin itu tidak ada menurut hukum fisika yang kita
2982673 sekali lagi anda salah pak gelap itu juga tidak ada gelap adalah keadaan dimana tidak ada cahaya cahaya bisa kita pelajari gelap tidak kita bisa menggunakan prisma newton untuk memecahkan cahaya menjadi beberapa warna dan mempelajari berbagai panjang gelombang setiap warna tapi anda tidak bisa mengukur gelap seberapa gelap suatu ruangan diukur dengan berapa intensitas cahaya di ruangan tersebut kata gelap dipakai manusia untuk mendeskripsikan ketiadaan cahaya
2982674 tentu saja seperti yang telah kukatakan sebelumnya kita melihat setiap hari di koran dan tv banyak perkara kriminal dan kekerasan di antara manusia perkara perkara tersebut adalah manifestasi dari kejahatan
2982675 sekali lagi anda salah pak kajahatan itu tidak ada kejahatan adalah ketiadaan tuhan seperti dingin atau gelap kejahatan adalah kata yang dipakai manusia untuk mendeskripsikan ketiadaan tuhan tuhan tidak menciptakan kajahatan kajahatan adalah hasil dari tidak adanya kasih tuhan dihati manusia seperti dingin yang timbul dari ketiadaan panas dan gelap yang timbul dari ketiadaan cahaya

2982679 our grand old musharraf has not been passing on all the 1 billion a year that the americans have been giving for the armed forces
2982680 the army has been getting 250m 300m reimbursement for what they do but wheres the rest they claim its been going in budget support but thats not the answer were talking about 700m a year missing the rest has been taken by musharraf for some scheme or other and weve got to find it
2982681 on the way to the competition we went through walberswick and its a really pretty town with lots of old churches and houses everywhere
2982682 we have a world class venue with the potential for an excellent facility for elite and community use post games
2982683 it is testament to the hard work of everyone in involved that we have been able to confirm an alternative venue for the mountain biking competition only seven months after the venue change was announced
2982684 we are delighted that such a stunning alternative venue has been found to host mountain biking for the london 2012 games
2982685 with an approximate journey time of 45 minutes to hadleigh farm from the olympic park the proximity to the olympic village will be of immense value to the mountain biking competitors
2982686 the potential for retaining a mountain biking course at hadleigh farm is very exciting as the sport is becoming increasingly popular in the uk and we want to build participation through the undoubted surge in interest in the run up to and after the london 2012 games
2982687 the finance minister must find credible solutions he is the financial advisor to the npp administration to governments money problems if he cannot do it and the president will not replace him then he should do the honourable thing resign

2982689 under his watch hon baah wiredu has managed inflation to near 20 and will certainly exceed it by the end of the year interest rates paid by small businesses and workers on loans now exceed 35
2982690 is losing value road contractors have stopped working because they are not getting paid many contractors and suppliers are owed significant sums of many ghana at 50 suppliers and contractors are complaining of debt owed to them yet the revenue agencies report record revenue collections or are these reports designed to fool the public
2982691 if the sale of ghana telecom was advertised in the 2005 budget what took his government so long in bringing the detail of the transaction to the knowledge of the public when did the administration receive a valuation of gt how much was it valued at and who did it we demand that the document be made public and for the public to be told which cabinet meeting was furnished with the information and as a result approved the sale at the price offered by vodafone indeed when did his administration give parliament the details of his transaction
2982692 when an artist signs on to the store they allocate a certain portion of the revenue generated by their songs to go back to their fans this money is then distributed according to how early each user purchased a song the earlier you buy the more you make for example the band my first earthquake has decided to pay out 30 of its revenues to its fans the earliest adopters say the first dozen people to buy the song will break even after the song has been purchased by around 25 other people fans buying the song later on will still earn credit but it will be earned at a much slower rate the site will tell you how quickly youll be earning credit before you buy a song

2982697 what were concerned about is that this government is tending to move to a centralised model where they think building a shiny new 1 billion hospital on the waterfront in hobart will fix the concerns of towns like campbell town st marys and the huon valley
2982698 it wont and what it will do is disenfranchise people that live in more country areas in this state

2982731 they have apparently agreed to help assure a secure and honourable stay for him in pakistan
2982732 they also want to ensure that the president should be given full indemnity should he agree to step down
2982733 this is more or less what the pakistan army also wants

2982744 contrary to reports this morning john kear still remains at the wakefield wildcats in his position of football director and head coach
2982745 he will remain in charge and he is working hard with the coaching staff and players to get the season back on track
2982746 it was galloping i got such a fright when i saw it because it is a massive dog compared to mine
2982747 it ran up and just grabbed him by the back of the neck and threw him up in the air i thought it had killed him
2982748 he had a wee padded coat and im sure that was the only thing that saved him
2982749 my daughter lifted him and the dog jumped up on her shoulders to try and get to him
2982750 just then a man who was delivering chinese meals saw what was happening and stopped his car and got us in
2982751 but the dog was jumping and scraping at the windows trying to get in
2982752 this had happened previously on several occasions before and she left the dog under the care of her sister
2982753 if it was let loose by other people then she cant be held responsible for their criminal actions
2982754 the onus is on you to ensure this animal was left in the care of a proper and responsible person in my opinion this was not the case so i find you guilty of these charges
2982755 if you are the owner of a dog you have duties and there is an responsibility on you to perform these
2982756 once again gordon browns economic incompetence has left britain ill prepared for this assault on living standards as each months figures bring further bad news on rising prices and with earnings failing to keep pace britains families are feeling the pinch

2982768 breathes or has a beating heart pulsation of the umbilical cord or definite movement of voluntary muscles
2982769 because what they were alleging were violations of existing law
2982770 the allegation that infants were allowed to expire in a utility room could not be substantiated and all staff interviewed denied that any infant was ever left alone
2982771 any baby born alive no matter what gestational age is a legal person
2982772 breathes or has a beating heart pulsation of the umbilical cord or definite movement of voluntary muscles
2982773 born alive infant protection act bills were identical in purpose and had the same intended effect and you think obamas record on the abortion issue is out of the pro choice mainstream
2982774 obamas views and votes on abortion reflect simply mainstream pro choice positions shared by nearly every other pro choice lawmaker in america
2982775 all reasonable measures consistent with good medical practice including the compilation of appropriate medical records shall be taken to preserve the life and health of the child
2982776 barack obama would have voted for h r 2175 the born alive infants protection act that passed the u s senate
2982777 the definition of born alive in the illinois abortion law of 1975 was enjoined by the federal courts in the herbst v omalley consent decree
2982778 quote another reporter quoting you and treat that as a source
2982779 and is it therefore reasonable or fair to conclude that obamas positions and votes on the abortion issue are stronger or more liberal than the positions and votes of mainstream pro abortion rights legislators throughout america well of course not

2982784 act of interference in indonesias internal affairs blameworthy and showing an intent to provoke
2982785 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
2982786 the negative tenor of campaigns can he traced to the competitive nature of political advertising to the activities of organized interests and last but not least to the ways in which reporters cover the campaign politicians interest groups and journalists all act in ways that serve their own best interests few of these players really want to produce highly negative campaigns but the interplay among them produces the kind of campaigns that voters have come to loathe
2982787 candidates and campaign strategists believe negative campaigning works however scholars have been unable to consistently validate the claims of practitioners
2982788 that is why all campaigns do it and contrary to what the mainstream media sissies think it is the right thing to do as a candidate for public office you have a duty to inform the voters about your opponents record certainly your opponent isnt going to reveal his her worst mistakes
2982789 four years of mccain means four years of the same

2982843 if all of this were to go away what are the one or two things i would want to keep that really would serve me now and as a meaningful memento of the past
2982844 the rules have changed now you are not allowed to have rings on so with one minute to go we had to saw it off
2982845 it was given to me by my dad seven years ago before he passed away but hopefully we can mend it again
2982846 one of the lads cut it off but im not sure who it was to be honest
2982847 jim paterson was told to warm up because there was literally 10 seconds to go so it was good preparation for me really
2982848 i thought they were going to take his finger off as well they eventually got it off but they cut him
2982849 jim was on the pitch just as a precaution in case we couldnt get the ring off
2982850 i find it a zany rule but its a rule for everybody no jewellery is allowed to be worn at all
2982851 i would never have believed that anybody would make up a rule where eventually a hacksaw has to be used on somebodys finger
2982852 the rule now is black and white you are not allowed one piece of jewellery on your body
2982853 it has to come off even if the finger comes off with it
2982854 it defies logic to me but thats the rule the referee was standing there saying he cant go on he cant go on
2982855 lewes manager keehan revealed trialist shabazz baidoo formerly of queens park rangers had been recommended to him by danny cullip baidoo played the second half against havant on saturday
2982856 i have seen a little bit of him but id like to see a little bit more
2982857 he did enough against havant for me to maybe want to see more
2982858 ive had a couple of chats with him and im still talking to him
2982859 at the moment its just if i can raise any more money really at the moment well go with the players weve got
2982860 im aware that we probably need one more player whether thats shabazz or someone else i dont know but well go and play saturday and possibly tuesday with what weve got and see how things are after that
2982861 government leaders have continuously prided themselves of having achieved racial and religious harmony in the country
2982862 it was their favourite slogan during the 50 years of independence celebrations but the inability to hold dialogues about religious issues to find durable solutions only shows that the nation is split along racial and religious lines
2982863 i said dont do it openly if one still proceeds to do so it will certainly cause strong reactions
2982864 we live in a multi cultural society in which people of different backgrounds are able to coexist peacefully this is because we have been tolerant and respectful of the sensitivities of different races
2982865 they seem to have ignored the fact that the bar council has already clarified that the forum was to address the conflicts of law
2982866 they should have come out with their proposals in addressing the issue of non muslim husbands who abandon their spouses and their families and convert into islam rather than to stop a legitimate forum
2982867 many who had converted were also in a dilemma as they were unable to revert to their former religion
2982868 such issues and procedures if left unresolved without good mutual understanding will continue to haunt the multi religious society of malaysia there will be controversy and even conflicts over family matters related to religious conversion
2982869 we should be aware of sensitivities about religions by all respective believers therefore all politicians must take a rational and reasonable approach to look at how to fine tune the relevant laws and procedures to avoid or minimise potential inter religious controversies and conflicts
2982870 you have over 300 protesters behaving aggressively carrying inciting banners and storming into the bar council forum raising uncalled for racial sentiments against fellow non malay malaysians without fear and protected by the royal police force
2982871 theres no such thing as too many pairs of shoes
2982872 not had the extensive growth that it had in the past
2982873 most of the multinational customers do have these intricate things that they have to tackle once in a while where do i locate distribution how do i get into another country how do i move heavy machinery putting all that together i think is going to be kind of the wave of the future for us
2982874 i hit 6 iron from 178 yards into the wind
2982875 i came out of it just a touch and it hit in the bank and came back into the water
2982876 not at all ben was playing well i could see that he was hanging in there nicely he had a good start and he hung on tough i wasnt only focused on padraig i thought ben had a realistic chance to win
2982877 you were three shots ahead of him going into the 10th hole are you thinking then that youre going to get your first major
2982878 hold on by the way on the 10th tee i wasnt leading by three make sure you get your facts right because i was tied with ben curtis there you go
2982879 we seen one guy he just went off into the bushes cramping up you know just completely smoked himself
2982880 its just fantastic opportunity to race with some of the best pros in the u s some of the best pros in the world realistically
2982881 its just impressive how athletic these guys are and how good they are at what they do and the speeds they go is amazing
2982882 our crowds are always great it was just phenomenal so we couldnt be happier
2982883 i think one of the goals here is to do a tour on new york with the beautiful topography and geography of new york state i think we can give anyone a run for their money
2982884 if everybody else is doing it one way theres a good chance you can find your niche by going in exactly the opposite direction

2982952 we dont have a good assessed scientific foundation right now
2982953 well bring some ends in and work them out but they are basically street free agents right now
2982954 everybody is looking for those guys those guys dont just grow on trees or they would be on somebody elses roster
2982955 so well still look at the waiver wire and see if we know somebody or have worked them out in the past or liked them but didnt draft them or take them as a free agent there are a lot of different means and some of those meetings are already going on and we already have people in the pipe that were going to try to bring in
2982956 football is a violent game and weve been on the grass down here
2982957 go up on the astroturf actually fieldturf at the metrodome i dont know you can look for as many explanations as you want
2982958 quarterbacks are continually getting hands across their faces and people waving things and bumped and moved
2982959 so its really more of a distraction that you have to focus through the wideouts were using them today i think were some of the first people to have those we have like 10 pairs of them
2982960 i kept telling the trainer and coach brad childress that its just a sprain
2982961 i was trying to be positive deep down i knew it was a lot more serious than that its tough its a bad feeling its not how you want to leave the game
2982962 its a tough situation because i really like heath and think hes a great person
2982963 i tore my acl so i know how that whole experience is and i know how it makes you feel i feel terrible for him
2982964 i spoke to chad several times the last few days hes been helping me out with it hes been a big help as far as being there for me he knows what im going through
2982965 what kills me is you prepare all year for these games and then not being able to play is the most depressing part
2982966 i was in better shape faster and stronger than ive been since ive been here thats the toughest thing its kind of a freak injury its real disappointing because i had high hopes for this year for myself and the team
2982967 i know the other guys dont feel themselves fortunate but its an opportunity and so well see who it is that steps in and takes the lead
2982968 somebody will step up whether it be a linebacker a defensive back or another defensive lineman im not sure who right now
2982969 were probably not going to make a roster move and sign another linebacker were probably going to let it play out with the guys who are in house right now
2982970 i dont think ive ever scripted 10 plays in a row since peewee football i know we never did at wisconsin or at the philadelphia eagles
2982971 thats a big area of improvement that we need to see this year
2982972 we obviously do plenty of work on running the football here in training camp and one of the things that our team needs to be better at is throwing the football protecting adrian and his growth
2982973 obviously we needed to take a look at all those protections and route running and i dont need to see peterson run a zone another time
2982974 there were some things that were pleasant and some things that need work but thats what its all about you just can point to the obvious and weve got things to come back and work on the offense did some good things but defensively we werent doing much
2982975 he was consistent and i thought he had a good spot on most of those throws i thought he obviously knew what was happening to him and you just want to see that standard of performance over and over again
2982976 well ive said all the way along that defensive end
2982977 we had the fumble that caused a touchdown for them that cost seven points and tight end jim kleinsasser had that false start which we ended up overcoming for a touchdown but we can play more disciplined and certainly improve on that end too
2982978 i was pleased with where were at in the return game and the coverage game as well
2982979 i thought they did some good things and great stuff for our young guys to teach from we didnt have any first teamers at all on any of our kick teams because you want to look at those younger guys so you kind of hold on and hope they do well and they actually gave a pretty good accounting but a lot of things to correct

2983062 like most property markets around the world asian markets have been affected by slowing economic growth and unsettled capital markets
2983063 a cautious attitude has become increasingly prevalent as many investors expect the ripple effect of the global credit crunch to continue unfolding in asia said anshuman magazine chairman and managing director of cb richard ellis south asia in india the investment market remained subdued developers profitability was also impacted by rising construction costs escalating interest rates and tighter lending measures
2983064 body weight maintenance is made up of three basic stages in the first stage the brain receives sensory input from the body including information provided by circulating hormones such as leptin and ghrelin and from fuels such as glucose and fatty acids
2983065 it is well known that agrp agouti related protein neurons play a critical role in feeding and energy balance regulation however the deletion of agrp and npy two neuropeptides released from the agrp neurons produces little metabolic effect
2983066 the mice with agrp neuron specific disruption of gaba release were lean had higher energy expenditure and showed resistance to diet induced obesity we also found that these animals showed reduced food intake response to the hormone ghrelin this suggests to us that the neurocircuit engaging gaba release from the agrp neurons mediates at least part of ghrelins appetite stimulating action
2983067 as these new findings demonstrate gaba release is an important component that mediates the function of agrp neurons discoveries such as this will ultimately help us to design an efficient strategy to tackle the current epidemic of obesity and metabolic disease
2983068 this study demonstrates that direct pharmacological blockade of task 1 and task 3 channels protects the most sensitive target of fetal alcohol exposure cerebellar purkinje cells

2983072 i dont think ive come across anything that i wouldnt do i guess im what you would call a thrill seeker i try to do the most exciting and crazy things in all aspects of my life i think my dream profession would be a stunt person doing all those thrilling things for the movies would be a lot of fun i have to have a good humor when i go out for adventure though sometimes accidents happen and the ones that arent serious are usually really embarrassing the only thing you can do is suck it up and go back to trying im also a big fan of role playing just give me a nurse outfit and youll forget all about your aches and pains trust me

2983077 jag har dragit skam och van ra ver min arbetsplats
2983078 ha sido una pelea muy complicada porque mi rival coloc buenos golpes pero creo que siempre fui para adelante y en el cuarto asalto busque que la balanza cayese de mi lado con siendo m s agresivo
2983079 estoy muy feliz de haber podido debutar en unos juegos ol mpicos con un triunfo
2983080 como es l gico enfrentarme a un rival chino en su ambiente no es lo mejor pero intentar darlo todo en el cuadril tero y sobre todo disfrutar ahora del gran triunfo que he conseguido
2983081 ambos hicimos m ritos para quedarnos con el triunfo l al final tuvo la suerte del recuento de golpes y tengo que aceptar la realidad
2983082 hab a llegado muy bien preparado y con la ilusi n de superar al menos el primer combate pero lo importante es que vi cumplido el sue o de estar en unos juegos ol mpicos y debo aprovechar mi experiencia
2983083 el primer partido es al mismo tiempo como una final nunca he vivido una cosa as y eso que pensaba que era un jugador con experiencia
2983084 se ha hecho con un cuadro y unos jugadores extraordinarios ujfalusi heitinga coupet en la delantera aguero no es grande pero muy robusto en la lucha directa muy presente en el rea de castigo y ante la porter a completamente astuto menos mal que falta en el partido de ida
2983085 schober es un guardameta con experiencia y benn h wedes es un talento de primera est claro que todav a le falta experiencia pero s lo la puede obtener si juega los mayores estamos para darle confianza en si mismo
2983086 al valencia lo dejamos atr s en el grupo en barcelona disputamos nuestro mejor partido pese a que quedamos eliminados muchos no nos hubieran cre do capaces de alcanzar los cuartos de final y eso que con un poco de suerte incluso podr amos haber llegado a semifinales nuestros rivales incluido el atl tico nos respetan ahora m s
2983087 hemos jugado un buen partido pero no hay que precipitarse
2983088 hemos jugado a un gran nivel con mucha inteligencia y velocidad ante un rival superior en el f sico hemos llevado en todo momento la iniciativa y el control del juego y no hemos dejado a rusia que nos intimidara con su fortaleza y altura un buen partido por nuestra parte sin duda
2983089 sin embargo no hay que precipitarse no hemos ganado nada me parece bien que celebremos la victoria pero tenemos que pensar que este es el segundo partido y que quedan muchos por delante con grandes equipos en frente hoy nos salieron bien las cosas pero nadie nos asegura nada
2983090 repito lo mismo no estamos luchando por las medallas todav a para eso queda tiempo y tenemos que seguir trabajando como lo hemos hecho hasta ahora
2983091 hemos jugado con inteligencia y velocidad eso es lo que m s destacar a de mis jugadoras que han sabido escoger siempre la opci n m s adecuada en todas las fases del partido no nos hemos dejado intimidar por la altura de las rusas
2983092 the early numbers suggest that all of this is fueling more interest
2983093 it encourages viewers and provides them with information there will be no dilution or fragmentation of the national audience
2983094 you need to get it measured so it becomes an incremental increase in your audience and you can get it on your rate card with your major advertisers
2983095 esta victoria nos llena de moral porque hemos ganado a las todav a subcampeonas ol mpicas pero m s que la victoria en s lo m s importante es c mo la conseguimos porque controlamos el juego en todo momento
2983096 creo que la velocidad sobre todo en defensa ha sido fundamental rusia es el equipo m s alto de la competici n y eso nos crea muchos problemas a nosotras pero hemos sabido hacerlo y hemos buscado y encontrado el hueco en ataque para hacerlas da o
2983097 otra de las cosas que ten amos preparadas y que hemos llevado a cabo era empezar cada set muy fuerte para impedir que las rusas pudieran coger r pido ventaja en el marcador hemos estado muy fluidas en ataque y en defensa hemos trabajado como si cada bal n fuera el ltimo
2983098 nos vino bien jugar con las argelinas porque as pudimos coger el pulso a la competici n y acoplarnos definitivamente contra rusia ya conoc amos el campo y est bamos con ritmo

2983102 llevo un mes malo trabajando bien pero jugando pat tico tengo que seguir trabajando y esperar a que lleguen los buenos resultados eso se ha visto en el partido de hoy l ha merecido la victoria y ha sido superior en todo momento

2983120 there are other places to get the money we ought to be going back and having a special session and rescinding those special interest tax cuts that were done this past year with no thought of where it was going to come from

2983279 but as far as we are concerned we have made contact with chelsea and thats where it lies at the moment

2983281 its a very expensive option but again it would be one if we got the option to speak to the lad or the opportunity to speak to the lad then who knows
2983282 but as far as we are concerned we have made contact with chelsea and thats where it lies at the moment
2983283 es ist viel stressiger als ein olympisches turnier zu fechten im moment z hlt vor allem sehen und gesehen werden
2983284 deshalb habe ich aufgeh rt ber die inhalte meiner kandidatur zu reden
2983285 as a woman in this day and age i am in a position to ask a man what he can do for me that i cant do for myself i pay my own bills i take care of my household with out the help of any man or woman for that matter

2983291 russias troops in south ossetia have proceeded to disarming and capturing the entrapped unites of georgian army
2983292 only the military targets are attacked we have never bombed and wont bomb tbilisi or the international airport or any other settlements in georgia
2983293 come through my mouth and i bet it will be fun
2983294 yes but that does not explain that i am a girl
2983295 ich denke der knoten ist jetzt geplatzt auch die anderen teams werden sich noch schw chen erlauben
2983296 es gibt angebote und interessenten wir werden uns bis jahresende entscheiden
2983297 ich fahre so lange wie es mir spa macht und das ist immer noch der fall
2983298 the vaio business programme is all about making the product more attractive for resellers
2983299 the weee system is subject to ongoing examination and refinement with the aim of developing and improving it
2983300 for instance the weee advisory body has been established to assist the government with this the uks priority for the first compliance period was to develop the system infrastructure and achieve the eu collection targets
2983301 looking around the industry it seems that failing to comply or to stop producing has been the main choice for the indie computer retailer with the prospect of it being enforced by the vca ignoring weee is not going to work in the long term
2983302 without a doubt best buy have a successful model in the states and will be an influence here in the uk
2983303 it is considered that the best buy impact is going to affect the other major retailers dsgi etc and those other recent entrants into this market for example tesco super stores rather than the independent retailer the consumer will still be looking for advice and guidance together with personal and after sales service it will obviously change the landscape as far as the major retail groups are concerned and add to competition requiring the independent retailer to recognise the strengths of their offering and the need to differentiate their services and highlight the range of offering they can provide
2983304 best buy is just a wolf in different clothing if youve got a problem you want solved on your computer you look for someone local to do it
2983305 irrespective of whether its software or not generally things are going more online
2983306 if you think about the way you buy things youll see its just the way things are going one of the things that is changing and evolving quite rapidly since the internet became more prolific is that customers are looking to consume software in quite a different way our traditional software whether thats packaged or licensed software is currently growing somewhere between six and twelve per cent yet the appetite for customers to buy online services software through a subscription is growing more rapidly than that at the moment gartner is predicting that by 2011 about 25 per cent of new business software will be delivered as a service so for our channel and for microsoft we have to make sure we can respond to that and make sure we can deliver software in new ways
2983307 our core product lines target the gaming market and we believe that hardcore gamers prefer not to buy online and so are actively seeking retail partners that have both the knowledge and passion for gaming
2983308 looking to the future we plan to extend our reseller network to include retailers with showroom and demonstration facilities to highlight the potential of the product
2983309 we hope that our relationship with stone will open up new opportunities to provide our customers with next day on site support making our after sales service a hard act to follow indeed and a major selling point for our channel partners
2983310 the rock bus is fully set up to hold lan competitions and demonstrate the rock portfolio
2983311 the blocker provides unique features delivered to the machine not from a central server
2983312 it is simple to set up and provide protection for example our social networking protection is effective out of the box once the user has set up an age rating for the machine
2983313 i think it should be about value proposition in a niche market place
2983314 small retailers can cover a very profitable niche for themselves and it comes back to the point of differentiation on service
2983315 when you go into some of these large box retailers and see the breadth of inventory that they carry at the price points that theyre able to present because of that purchasing power youve got to say gosh thats an awfully formidable offering in the marketplace
2983316 man geht nicht einfach so zu den spielen nicht wenn man der ist der ich bin

2983320 this approach of looking at both channel margins and suggested retail prices simultaneously is aimed at motivating the channel to look seriously at promoting d link branded hardware and we have taken the fight to our competitors to win the price to performance battle
2983321 d link was first to market with its energy saving green ethernet technology and we see this as the de facto standard going forward
2983322 with green ethernet being introduced across our gigabit smart switches as well as our desktop switches this technology is now beginning to roll out across our entire product portfolio
2983323 we believe it is our high standards of customer service and support that sets cancom apart from our competitors
2983324 were pleased to support the association in their endeavors to make sure these standards are offered across the whole apple reseller channel
2983325 as interest and market share in apple computers continues to grow so does the number of dealers and resellers for them

2983338 its difficult to praise rob without insinuating that there was something not great about his predecessor and ive got nothing but respect and love for former metallica bassist jason newsted
2983339 but rob hes been with us five years now and its completely effortless its never felt this complete
2983340 sometimes i look over at him and hes playing his bass onstage and it feels like hes always been there his chemistry his personality it just all fits in really really well

2983349 unless that container is chock full of diamonds its shipping costs have suddenly inflated the cost of whatever is inside
2983350 and those inflated costs get passed onto the consumer price index when you buy that good at your local retailer as oil prices keep rising pretty soon those transport costs start cancelling out the east asian wage advantage

2983450 i can honestly say that after 24 years of living with hiv i have been angry at it more than once i have been angry for many reasons and i have been angry because hiv didnt take me like it did so many others
2983451 i know that some of my anger will diminish once the first signs of spring appear but some of them just dont go away at the changing of the season i can only hope that on most days the anger is balanced out with hope and dreams of what tomorrow may bring
2983452 if you are hiv and not comfortable with your new state of health you need to read this and absorb its content to your life i dont care if you are a gay person a straight woman or straight man it is a part of you and a part of who you are you might deny it but to do so is not only futile but is also very damaging to your own psyche in the same way hiv is now part of who you are it will be with you until you die and that is just the way it is
2983453 a veteran civil rights advocate and former georgia state representative and senator bond 68 said hes motivated to advocate on behalf of people diagnosed with hiv aids because many of them are rendered silent by the stigma attached to the disease and
2983454 what echoes in my ear is that everyone seems to feel shame on some level why is this certainly shame devalues us and our self esteem as adults we should learn to accept and love who we are and what we have done otherwise we only hold ourselves back from change and or progress in this life

2983488 um die kampfkraft der armee zu schw chen haben die agenten der achsenm chte daf r gesorgt dass die us soldaten g nstig und massenhaft mit drogen versorgt werden

2983494 das gehirn ist der gr te abnehmer von glukose dem traubenzucker es macht zwar nur zwei prozent vom gesamtgewicht des menschen aus beansprucht aber 50 prozent des t glichen glukosebedarfs in stresssituationen sind es sogar 90 prozent
2983495 deshalb bezeichnen wir das gehirn als selfish brain denn es verh lt sich eigenn tzig doch die anderen organe haben sich darauf eingestellt und normalerweise funktioniert dieser verteilungsmechanismus f r glukose gut wir nennen ihn allokation
2983496 wir wissen heute ganz genau welche hirnzentren die allokation f r mehr glukose steuern da gibt es einmal die zwei bergeordneten zentren amygdala mandelkern und hippocampus diese sind beide mehr oder weniger zur gefahrenanalyse da unter stress werden von hier erregende signale an den ventromedialen hypothalamus weitergeleitet eine im hirnstamm gelegene region und gleichzeitig ein wichtiger nervenknotenpunkt er kontrolliert das unbewusste nervensystem und reguliert die nahrungsaufnahme
2983497 wenn die signale zur glukoseallokation nicht richtig verarbeitet werden etwa aufgrund von beeintr chtigungen in amygdala oder hippocampus wird zwar die energieversorgung des gehirns nicht gef hrdet aber es kann zu einem zuviel des guten kommen
2983498 die oben genannten faktoren k nnen die hirnzentren in ihrer funktion sch digen das ist aus zahlreichen studien ganz deutlich erkennbar

2983574 body weight maintenance is made up of three basic stages in the first stage the brain receives sensory input from the body including information provided by circulating hormones such as leptin and ghrelin and from fuels such as glucose and fatty acids
2983575 it is well known that agrp agouti related protein neurons play a critical role in feeding and energy balance regulation however the deletion of agrp and npy two neuropeptides released from the agrp neurons produces little metabolic effect
2983576 the mice with agrp neuron specific disruption of gaba release were lean had higher energy expenditure and showed resistance to diet induced obesity we also found that these animals showed reduced food intake response to the hormone ghrelin this suggests to us that the neurocircuit engaging gaba release from the agrp neurons mediates at least part of ghrelins appetite stimulating action
2983577 as these new findings demonstrate gaba release is an important component that mediates the function of agrp neurons discoveries such as this will ultimately help us to design an efficient strategy to tackle the current epidemic of obesity and metabolic disease

2983581 our research suggests that unconscious thought is more susceptible to irrelevant factors such as how recently information has been seen rather than how important it is if conscious thinkers are given adequate time to encode material or are allowed to consult material while they deliberate their choices are at least as good as those made unconsciously

2983585 to be honest it was when i was afraid that people would recognise me that i was recognised much more

2983593 but then i changed and said you know what thats ridiculous its the olympics and im here for the united states of america and i dont care how bad it hurts honestly in like five seconds i was thinking all these things and then i got like this super charge and went from there it was unreal

2983646 we havent announced anything for this type of cheap mini notebook and were still taking this wait and see attitude
2983647 the fact that there are a number of models coming out might give the indication that the market is growing and everybody wants to do this but whats interesting is you pull back the covers and talk to people in the industry and theyre kind of scared
2983648 if you cant grow the market with this form factor then what youre providing is a lower experience for less money which isnt good for the consumer and isnt good for the hardware maker and really isnt good for the channel as well
2983649 we believe the story line of ultra low cost notebooks will increasingly be sidelined as the notebook market continues to offer a better solution and experience at price points similar to what ultra low cost notebooks are hitting

2983701 the surreptitious manner in which the government has opted to deal with this scheme begs more questions than answers
2983702 we believe it will be immoral for government to spend this amount of taxpayers money as it does not come from the pension funds of the beneficiaries but from the treasury
2983703 those in powerful positions do not satisfy the needs of the minority groups even though some are affiliated members of the ruling swapo party therefore the dpn is for the forgotten society

2983706 the northerners are trucked in to grab job opportunities in the south while the people of the south live in abject poverty
2983707 i know jesaya nyamu of rdp has said that swapo members must remove their party flags from trees houses and shops here in the north i want to tell nyamu that he is not the one to describe to swapo what swapo must and should do

2983725 if he is not recognised then the ovambanderu community members should vote on whom they want as chief as the traditional authorities act provides for such an election
2983726 the letter with the alleged will of my late husband to have somebody else kilus instead of my son as his successor which appeared after his death is not known to me i was never consulted on this nor did i have any knowledge of it
2983727 i was assigned by the late chief munjuku ii my brother to keep and grow keharanjo and propose him as the next leader this i did and at every place i went with him the ovambanderu community endorsed him as successor

2983730 the war on gangs will continue until every high flyer is behind bars
2983731 much has been done to end the gang wars there are almost no violent gang fights which plagued communities in the late 90s and into the new millennium with regard to crime high flyers there have been successes but not everyone could be convicted and sentenced there is one man in particular that i would like to see in jail
2983732 i have nothing against anyone and dont take things personally in this environment i have faith in my team and am confident that high flyers will be caught
2983733 seeing staggie in prison was the best thing that could have happened
2983734 it is also good to see that die hok a wooden building in manenberg formerly used by the hard livings gang has been turned into a church
2983735 gangsterism has been coming on for years and gang bosses are established and respected members of many communities on the cape flats
2983736 the police should remember gangs will exist as long as there is poverty unemployment is a serious problem and the youth see gangsterism and drugs as the only alternative they see gang bosses as role models and do everything in their power to be like them
2983737 there were many but i have a good team of dedicated people who have helped make the past five years very fruitful
2983738 during my first few months as provincial commissioner the crime stats presented a very bad picture with high rape and murder figures in the province but im proud to say that that soon changed
2983739 this year we had a 32 percent reduction in violent crimes in the province and now the challenge remains to improve on that figure next year

2983743 the philippines is one of the countries hard hit by poverty and hunger in the asian region
2983744 high food prices plunge them deeper into poverty and make them more vulnerable to its effects the crisis creates drastically increased levels of poverty and hunger
2983745 in a study by the asian development bank a 10 percent increase alone in the price of rice causes an additional 660 000 people in the poverty rate
2983746 like a tsunami the wfp has somehow foreseen the food crisis but everything came up very quickly leaving the vulnerable most harmed
2983747 when food is expensive poor families tend to cut meals and substitute less nutritious foods those who live in rural areas sell their buffalos or oxen just to earn their keep more children withdraw from school as well
2983748 we make the children take home food rations to share with their families

2983901 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2983902 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2983903 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2983904 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2983905 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2983906 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2983907 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2983908 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2983958 in life you dont get what you want you get what you are the best way to improve yourself is to change what goes into your mind we are a product of what goes into our minds what you think determines what you do what you do determines what you accomplish
2983959 the ownership of money and property comes as a result of doing things in a certain way those who do things in this certain way whether on purpose or accidentally get rich those who do not do things in this certain way no matter how hard they work or how able they are remain poor

2983963 youll continue to see a high degree of flux for probably the next several years
2983964 even if i were starting from scratch today i still think id bet on javascript and ajax its going to be hard to stop the massive momentum we have
2983965 flash is seeing a pretty aggressive growth cycle now but i still think javascript is going to be used in 10 times the number of flash apps that launch
2983966 its amazing what people have done with html which was never intended to do rich internet applications and flash was originally created for lightweight animation literally for mickey mouse on the web
2983967 but these technologies were designed for something else and people are really hacking them to do more
2983968 if you put it all together that lends itself to ajax being a very powerful capable rich internet application technology
2983969 if you look at google apps theyre doing great things but how many shops out there have the ajax chops that google does
2983970 we expect gears to be widely adopted in products like gmail
2983971 access the file system make system calls into the computer drag and drop access the webcam
2983972 gears can be ahead of the curve trying out new ideas that eventually become a new standard
2983973 nothing really comes close to the kind of desktop experience we have in picnik
2983974 itll take an incredibly long time to see it implemented across browsers and a long time to see high level of compatibility where you can really rely on it without a huge productivity drain on developers
2983975 with adobes rev of flash player version 10 theyve done a remarkable job of knocking out key things we had a conversation a year and a half ago where we gave them a wish list they have been really responsive
2983976 if they take a similar sized leap in short order say a years time frame they could be in the game
2983977 if they are the first to nail 3d that could give developers a lot of reasons to use their technologies
2983978 were going to be iterating pretty quickly and each version is going to add new features and functionality
2983979 i think were living in one of the most active periods of web development right now
2983980 we saw it as a tool to help us with retention and recruitment
2983981 this definitely is something that has helped with our stature in the community and with our competitiveness

2983994 in the league hes not going to be able to run through everybody hes got to work on his technique snugging and pulling to get off press coverage other than that he runs pretty good routes
2983995 he was a big play threat last year but he wasnt really the deep threat that we wanted there were a lot of runs after the catch
2983996 much of the immediate prognosis for the euro will depend on mr trichets answers to questions about the eurozone economy strict inflation talk from mr trichet is expected but the more he acknowledges pending economic weakness or cooling inflation the more the markets will begin to price a rate cut
2983997 we are identifying downside risk for a number of months and i would say that the information that we have which are very very clear for some of them suggest the materialization of those risks
2983998 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee

2984002 its almost unheard of summer doesnt usually afford films that much of a wide open playing field
2984003 it has taken on a life of its own and in doing so got so much positive press and word of mouth that older audiences who normally dont rush out to see movies or maybe only see two three movies a year are coming out in large numbers
2984004 its a question of weve been reading about this for three four weeks now

2984022 we have reached some areas that had been isolated for two days
2984023 we are focusing on finding the people still missing its bad we are afraid they are dead and well have to recover their bodies
2984024 the traffic jams are very serious and many vehicles and passengers are stuck
2984025 local inhabitants face many difficulties because there is not enough food
2984026 two more bodies have been recovered they had been swept away in the strong currents
2984027 a lot of people were standing there watching like they were fireworks i was like get out of here people
2984028 it shouldnt have been put in a residential area it should not have been there
2984029 nobody did a damn thing nobody and now the damage is done
2984030 ive seen homes from explosion before where its nothing but a pile of rubble i didnt see any of that here
2984031 pervez has insulted and compromised pakistans sovereignty by allowing the cia and fbi to operate freely in pakistan and arrest interrogate torture deport and detain any person whether pakistani or not for as long as they like thus turning the pakistani army and security agencies into hunting dogs in the contemporary crusade
2984032 let there be no doubt in your minds that the dominant political forces at work in pakistan today are competing to appease and please the modern day crusaders in the white house and are working to destabilise this nuclear capable nation under the aegis of america
2984033 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2984034 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2984035 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2984036 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2984037 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2984038 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2984039 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2984040 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2984041 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2984042 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2984043 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2984044 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2984045 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

2984072 it gives iphone a justifiable claim to being a viable gaming platform

2984076 this is not necessarily because ive got some issues with 360 in continental european countries et cetera but because of the set top box hi def phenomenon
2984077 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
2984078 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
2984079 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
2984080 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
2984081 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
2984082 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
2984083 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
2984084 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
2984085 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
2984086 vamos analisar e verificar qual a melhor medida para garantir o ressarcimento

2984097 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2984098 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2984099 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2984100 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2984101 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2984102 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2984103 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2984104 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2984105 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2984106 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2984107 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2984108 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2984109 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2984110 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2984111 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2984112 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2984113 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2984114 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2984115 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2984116 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2984117 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2984118 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2984119 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2984120 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2984121 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
2984122 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
2984123 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
2984124 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
2984125 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2984126 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2984127 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2984128 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2984129 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2984130 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2984131 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2984132 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2984133 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2984134 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2984135 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
2984136 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
2984137 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
2984138 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
2984139 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
2984140 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
2984141 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
2984142 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
2984143 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
2984144 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
2984145 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
2984146 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
2984147 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
2984148 you dont need any proof you just see it its in here everyday
2984149 you can see the rivers turning color and dead fish
2984150 i see where i live i live in costa rica at the moment and its very beautiful and clean
2984151 i see the difference about how the us is treating all its resources
2984152 i ride a bike i dont drive a car little things but i still us too much
2984153 its the price of gas i think that has made people think a little bit more about improving their lifestyle and giving back to the earth
2984154 my goal is to show people how to cook local produce
2984155 it doesnt have to be transported all the way across the country or across the globe
2984156 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
2984157 given your committees recent focus on deep packet inspection in connection with advertising we feel it important to state clearly and for the record that google does not deliver advertising based on deep packet inspection
2984158 we understand that many of the questions that you have posed to us and a number of other companies stem from concerns about that particular model for online advertising but we believe that the vast majority of online advertisers like google is not engaged in these practices
2984159 questions have been raised regarding the applicability of privacy protections and whether legislation is needed to ensure that the same protections apply regardless of the particular technologies or companies involved
2984160 we understand this question to be focused primarily on the implementation of deep packet inspection advertising practices by a small number of u s isps in partnership with a privately held online advertising company
2984161 educate people that the climate crisis is both urgent and solvable
2984162 we ensure that every product or service they offer through the campaign makes it easier or cheaper for you to do your bit and help tackle climate change
2984163 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2984164 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2984165 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2984166 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2984167 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2984168 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2984169 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2984170 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2984171 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2984172 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2984173 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
2984174 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
2984175 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
2984176 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
2984177 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
2984178 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
2984179 one of the obvious high priorities in my talks with president hugo chavez would be the fermentation of anti american sentiment in latin america
2984180 to avoid being mistaken for a sellout i chose my friends carefully the more politically active black students t he marxist professors and structural feminists
2984181 a close look at john mccains senate voting record on judicial confirmations makes it painfully clear that progressives need to ignore the rantings of the ann coulter crowd and believe john mccain when he says he will listen to sam brownback and appoint judges like samuel alito and antonin scalia
2984182 indeed one looks in vain for a judge who is too ideologically conservative for mccain he voted to confirm robert bork clarence thomas and unless ive missed something every other republican judicial nominee voted on in his 22 years in the senate
2984183 even more tellingly as part of his negotiation in 2005 of what has been dubbed the
2984184 no one thinks john mccain would nominate ethically challenged judges but there is every reason to think that he will nominate ideological conservatives to the supreme court and lower federal courts
2984185 this is important because federal courts are already dominated by republican appointees seven of the nine justices and a sizeable majority of lower federal court judges were appointed by republican presidents with the courts liberal moderate judges on average 15 years older than the courts conservatives john mccain in the white house could easily deliver the court to the right wing for a generation
2984186 we are very fortunate that our president in these challenging days can rely on the counsel of a man who has demonstrated time and again the resolve experience and patriotism that will be required for success and the hard headed clear thinking necessary to prevail in this global fight between good and evil
2984187 people can relate to other people that they know or people in a similar circumstance they are therefore more inclined to take a chance and do something different
2984188 green marketing is totally an increased buzzword the average person doesnt check to see if the word holds any weight with the business
2984189 people should look at what companies are actually doing to be sustainable
2984190 everyday i would take an industrial sized trash bag and at least fill it to the brim with paper and cardboard despite the fact that there were recycling bins available on campus
2984191 the only real trash that we had was coffee grinds and those are biodegradable
2984192 the cake went all over me that was the end of my suit
2984193 i always wondered whether sometime a political protester would hit me with a pie in the face i never thought a friendly birthday cake would attack me from the rear
2984194 id like to hear the governor and legislative leaders tell the voters where the shortfall is coming from and unless i hear that im not sure we ought to take a gamble
2984195 education funding is very important part of our economy has to be based on attracting and keeping good paying jobs and we cant do that without a well educated work force
2984196 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2984197 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2984198 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2984199 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2984200 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2984201 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2984202 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2984203 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2984204 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2984205 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2984206 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2984207 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2984208 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2984209 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2984210 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2984211 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
2984212 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
2984213 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
2984214 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2984215 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2984216 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
2984217 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
2984218 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
2984219 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
2984220 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2984221 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2984222 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2984223 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2984224 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2984225 just so you all know we did set a record
2984226 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2984227 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2984228 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2984229 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
2984230 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
2984231 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
2984232 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
2984233 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
2984234 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
2984235 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
2984236 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
2984237 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
2984238 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
2984239 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
2984240 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
2984241 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports
2984242 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2984243 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy
2984244 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
2984245 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
2984246 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
2984247 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
2984248 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
2984249 hes not bound by the same restrictions that another officer for the party would be
2984250 harrys done an outstanding job as our finance chairman and hes always had the highest regard for integrity
2984251 the evidence of this affair was right in front of the good old boys of main stream media but they looked the other way
2984252 just one year ago the company spent millions of dollars expanding into different markets and now they decided it was a mistake and shut down the expansion efforts
2984253 the irony of those decisions is that the very managers that made those decisions were not laid off but the talent that led the companys successes locally were all let go
2984254 change end user behavior in order to reduce the demand for pirated software
2984255 many people still arent aware that piracy in one industry sector has a knock on effect in others every lost sale makes it harder for software companies to keep updating our favourite programs if we can educate people to think more seriously about the consequences of software piracy thats a big step in the right direction
2984256 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
2984257 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
2984258 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
2984259 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2984260 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
2984261 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
2984262 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
2984263 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2984264 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2984265 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2984266 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2984267 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2984268 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
2984269 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
2984270 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
2984271 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
2984272 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
2984273 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
2984274 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2984275 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
2984276 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
2984277 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2984278 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
2984279 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2984280 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
2984281 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
2984282 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2984283 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2984284 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2984285 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2984286 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2984287 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2984288 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
2984289 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
2984290 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
2984291 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
2984292 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2984293 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
2984294 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
2984295 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2984296 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2984297 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2984298 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2984299 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers

2984308 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2984309 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2984310 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
2984311 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
2984312 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
2984313 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
2984314 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
2984315 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
2984316 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
2984317 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2984318 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2984319 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2984320 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2984321 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2984322 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2984323 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2984324 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2984325 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
2984326 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
2984327 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2984328 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2984329 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2984330 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change

2984332 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2984333 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
2984334 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain

2984336 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
2984337 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
2984338 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
2984339 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
2984340 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
2984341 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
2984342 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
2984343 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2984344 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2984345 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2984346 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
2984347 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
2984348 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
2984349 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
2984350 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
2984351 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
2984352 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2984353 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2984354 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2984355 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2984356 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
2984357 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
2984358 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
2984359 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
2984360 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
2984361 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
2984362 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
2984363 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
2984364 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
2984365 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
2984366 the bio metric database for immigration clearance as well as for contrabands we do have our non intrusive scanning technologies that can help us scan the cargo so that we can cut down on our manpower we will continue looking into technology as well as training up our officers to get them to be more well versed in the new modus operandi of these smugglers
2984367 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
2984368 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
2984369 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
2984370 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
2984371 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
2984372 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
2984373 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
2984374 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
2984375 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
2984376 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
2984377 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
2984378 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
2984379 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
2984380 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
2984381 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
2984382 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
2984383 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2984384 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
2984385 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
2984386 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
2984387 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
2984388 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2984389 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2984390 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
2984391 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
2984392 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
2984393 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2984394 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
2984395 alam na alam mo kung paano mo dadalhin yung kanta na yan
2984396 yung sa boses hindi ko pwedeng sabihin na sobrang galing hindi ko rin puwede sabihin na napakapangit pero kung totality ang titignan ko pati yung kung paano mo dalhin yung sarili mo you have it
2984397 you know what i was feeling when i was watching you i was extremely proud of you weve seen you grow and i think theres so much more that youre gonna offer i really like to see you tomorrow and be part of the final three
2984398 sa akin daryl the past performances mo pwedeng puwede kang to qualify sa top three keep it up
2984399 in the beginning of the song i could not really understand what you were singing medyo mahina yung boses mo i felt that it was low for you
2984400 sayang yung progress mo for the past few weeks you were really really doing well maybe today you were very emotional but you have to control that emotion to be able to perform well
2984401 i dont think the song was really meant for you you shouldve chosen a simpler one
2984402 kaya lang yung song na yan talagang tumatatak si fantasia you couldnt help sometimes to compare hindi mo talaga na perform well yung song next time you be careful in choosing your song
2984403 hindi lang masydong malinis ang falsetto mo but thats very minor and then the song ang gusto ko dun naramdman mo naramdaman ko na nararamdaman mo ang pag perform ng song na yun and you did it well sa tingin ko sa ngayon so far kayo ni daryl ang magkalaban
2984404 it didnt seem to be a song that was pang final pero wow you really did it tonight congratulations
2984405 para sa akin ang kulang nalang gawin mo pang mas sexy yung galaw mo kasi napakaganda ng boses mo e siguro pag naging sexy pa yung galaw mo yun na yun ikaw na to congratulations
2984406 maybe it was nerves pero habang umaandar ka parang diesel ka medyo umiinit medyo nakukuha mo na yung tono you know its interesting for me to hear you sing a song so plainly and you know that was good
2984407 jayann narinig ko din yung mga flats yung mga sharps
2984408 pero nung nakikita ko at nararamdaman ko yung kagustuhan mo dun sa kanta parang nadadala na rin ako so hindi ko na naisip na merong flats or sharp mahalaga din yan sa mga nanonood
2984409 katulad ako viewer din ako pag nakikita ko yung pinapanood ko dala niya yung kanta nadadala na rin ako e so good job
2984410 pero nakikita ko nag e enjoy ka nararamdaman mo yung song you really like it at nagawa mo naman ng tama
2984411 alam mo no doubt yung ganyang klaseng song yung ganyang klaseng performance you do it well
2984412 magaling ka diyan ang concern ko lang parang wala akong makitang iba na pwede mong ipakita other than that nag e expect ako ng mas iba naman
2984413 you have this uncanny ability to get people going with your energy
2984414 that was really a solid performance that was really good however i think ang hinahanap ni wyngard is because we know you can do so much more than that its too easy for you
2984415 we want to hear something soulful i suppose from your heart something that youll sing from your heart and really get us emotional and gooey all over when we hear you
2984416 a large number of south african men are bigger and complain about condoms being uncomfortable and too small
2984417 se un problema non pu risolversi a che serve preoccuparsi
2984418 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
2984419 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
2984420 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
2984421 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
2984422 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
2984423 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
2984424 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
2984425 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
2984426 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2984427 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
2984428 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
2984429 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
2984430 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
2984431 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
2984432 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
2984433 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
2984434 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2984435 please use public transit bicycling or other climate friendly means
2984436 have to go back 15 years to find ice expansion so far south
2984437 responsible individuals throughout the industrialized world are trying to come to grips with the harm being done to the global environment
2984438 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2984439 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2984440 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2984441 hey im changing so i can get votes in texas or arizona
2984442 no foreign state may be sued in any court except with the consent of the central government certified in writing by a secretary to that government
2984443 2 60 000 francs equivalent to 17 030 grams of gold
2984444 we have sought a no objection certificate from the mohali deputy commissioner before issuing the acquisition notice for 1 000 acres which will be in addition to the almost 306 acres already acquired in jheourheri village for the airport terminal
2984445 he mittal would like to go for a full buyout
2984446 it doesnt make any sense for mittal to look at spicejet
2984447 i use the stories to help the students practice important concepts like comprehension summary character plot and development
2984448 we use three stations in our classroom of exceptional education students english language learners and intensive reading students
2984449 hmmmm let me think this is reading class ok just the one time
2984450 thinking about our last goodbye im not sure who took the prize i guess we both lost in the end
2984451 im way too cool to cry and im way too young to die im fine for now getting by somewhere in the back of your mind
2984452 a esquerda agora compreende os mercados e o papel que podem desempenhar na economia d se o contr rio com a direita sobretudo nos eua a nova direita tipificada na administra o bush cheney de facto o velho corporativismo com nova cara
2984453 if i could do it again id make sure i had better form but it was great fun and i have the experience now
2984454 i am just going to keep doing the same things i would do in a normal competition but now i have got rid of my nerves to go into the individual
2984455 tom didnt dive to the best of his ability but we are a team and that is why synchro is so tough because you both need to be on form at the same time
2984456 his lack of experience was the reason he wasnt on top of his game today he has had a lot of media coverage over the last few months and he had a lot more nerves than i did
2984457 i have been around the block a few times but for tom i think it was the whole experience of being at the olympics which stopped him diving well
2984458 both tom and blake will benefit greatly from the experience
2984459 their second dive was a little below par and that set them behind
2984460 it meant they were chasing thats when the wheels start to come off but they will learn from that
2984461 that was a hard event full of very experienced divers which is nothing to sneeze at when you remember tom is just 14
2984462 we were hoping for sixth but its good for him to have it under his belt
2984463 a lot will happen in the next four years by the time he gets to london hell be a seasoned pro
2984464 we have competed with him before we work together quite often
2984465 a lot of times our lenders change the opportunity but you dont know it until you go in and view it so i think this is really helpful i would want to know if the account owner changed or a contact was added to a company
2984466 the constant workflow items that come up if a case meets a certain criteria or a contact or if a new asset is created sales announcements opportunities closing new products if it were customizable enough we could push certain fields kind of like a workflow trigger

2984473 weve been preparing for an ipo for several years weve strengthened the board moved to international accounting standards and if the markets improve well be ready but were in a strong cash position even without such an event
2984474 we obviously cant rule out a trade buy either we talk to lots of people in the market but our focus is on growing organically although we had a good first half we had an even better second half
2984475 pero como explicar que me siento vulgar al bajarme de cada escenario
2984476 this one shocked me over anything and now were up to over 1 3 million raised just here in northern california against this proposition
2984477 people in other states who are just hanging out and im really just speaking to christians because theres nothing i can do about non christians and the gays theyve already kind of made up their mind they need to get involved they need to be aware
2984478 in this telephone conversation they voiced their satisfaction at the constructive trend of negotiations in geneva and in subsequent contact they described the trend of these negotiations as constructive
2984479 nothing has changed we stick to the two track approach the channels of communication remain open
2984480 on the one side pressure for sanctions in the but also the offer of dialogue for the iranians to come to the table to discuss the package of incentives which has been proposed to them
2984481 we dont believe this is illegal we have sought extensive advice both internally and externally and prior to conducting this trial its not illegal
2984482 if the advice was that it might be legal and it might not be then clearly they were running a significant risk with this trial i find it very hard to believe they thought it was completely legal because there was no attempt to seek consent from anyone
2984483 i dont think thats true i suppose i am refuting the suggestion
2984484 en una sociedad cada vez m s dependiente de las tecnolog as de la informaci n debemos estar preparados ataques inform ticos
2984485 a menudo se cree que el ciberataque es algo adicional al ataque f sico pero ya no es as no se puede subestimar
2984486 desde el robo de secretos de estado al caos general de un pa s o la utilizaci n de centros energ ticos clave para causar atentados
2984487 se protegen las estructuras f sicas redes telem ticas centros de comunicaciones de grandes centros energ ticos y redes de transportes entre otras los sistemas sustentados en infraestructuras digitales son por supuesto una parte primordial

2984497 for over 20 years i have observed the progressive deterioration of this site as the mound suffered from erosion by livestock and the masonry became increasingly unstable and overgrown by vegetation
2984498 it is therefore of huge personal satisfaction to see the monument conserved before too much was lost
2984499 items found range in date from about 1640 to perhaps the late 18th century focused especially on the civil war defence of aberlleiniog and the subsequent conversion of the motte into a folly soon after 1700

2984513 i think a certain amount of tension is very healthy and a certain amount of different views
2984514 because of the bubble that a president is in and the bubble that a candidate is in sometimes you find out afterwards something that oh boy i wish i had heard thus and such and so and so so i appreciate and want some of the tension i dont want too much of it obviously because we have to have certain efficiencies but i think there is a balance there
2984515 senator obama a couple of days ago said that we ought to all inflate our tires and i dont disagree with that the american automobile association strongly recommends it
2984516 it is formally headed by steve and rick this is one of the things that has been improved

2984526 i was watching michael phelps after the anchor leg touched
2984527 the whole thing is genuine thats the good thing about the olympics
2984528 theyre genuinely pleased that the president came to support them
2984529 and i really believe that it helps them realize the country is supporting them a lot of people are pulling for them
2984530 i can make a shawarma from what i just threw up

2984540 when they cry for help i will not answer though they anxiously search for me they will not find me for they hated knowledge and chose not to fear the lord they rejected my advice and paid no attention when i corrected them therefore they must eat the bitter fruit of living their own way choking on their own schemes for simpletons turn away from me to death fools are destroyed by their own complacency but all who listen to me will live in peace untroubled by fear of harm

2984576 over the last two weeks how often have you been bothered by the following problem thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way
2984577 it is worrying that despite improvements in cancer care a substantial number of patients feel they would be better off dead
2984578 we know that depression is common in patients who have cancer but it is often missed
2984579 pain is also a big problem treating patients symptoms as well as their disease might improve and even save their lives
2984580 it is normal to experience distress after a cancer diagnosis
2984581 but for some patients emotional distress or depression becomes a problem in itself and may lead to suicidal thoughts
2984582 il nostro obiettivo ha detto scopelliti quello di renderla fruibile prima dei festeggiamenti settembrini la nostra stata una soluzione che ci ha consentito di non perdere pi altro tempo al fine di completare i lavori celermente

2984587 this is particularly true for women who are most affected by the epidemic as for far too long hiv positive women have been invited only after agendas have been set out or policy decisions taken
2984588 it is necessary to fulfil the commitments made to ensuring womens and girls voices concerns and perspectives are incorporated in the decision making processes that affect their lives
2984589 hiv positive women and other key populations need to be more than bystanders or advisors in the formation of the content and direction of the aids response they must be supported to be leaders

2984592 hola carmen si te gusta tanto el queso como a nosotros te va a
2984593 im feeling pretty good now and im anxious to get back on track ive now got full movement back in the injured knee and its been fine during my training regime up to now
2984594 i dont think its going to cause me any problems on the bike but its been almost seven weeks since ive thrown a leg over the ninja zx rr so i wont know for sure until we start free practice on friday
2984595 also our bridgestone tyres work well at this track and this combined with the new parts that kawasaki are bringing to the czech grand prix means weve got some positive things to work with even though the rehab at home with family and friends has been enjoyable i am really looking forward to seeing the team getting back on the bike and finding again the total mental focus necessary for the best possible result this weekend
2984596 there is no reason for panic but we are calling on all german citizens to contact the embassy
2984597 essential that there is an immediate and non conditional ceasefire and for all armed forces to withdraw to the positions held before the conflict
2984598 estoy muy feliz por haber fichado por osasuna y poder disputar la liga espa ola la mejor del mundo
2984599 theres been a lot of rubbish written and thats what it is rubbish
2984600 ive been in the game 20 odd years and i can deal with most things but its just annoying to see some of this stuff coming out before the league season has even started
2984601 if we lose the first five games of the season then yes but that hasnt happened until then people have got to give us a chance
2984602 it is disappointing weve just got to get on with it and make sure we are ready for the start of the season
2984603 i think people seem to see us as a selling club and were not our record speaks for itself over the last few years in where weve finished in the league
2984604 people think they can come in to disrupt our players and unsettle the new manager before the season starts if anything it makes me more determined
2984605 we were never informed or advised that an indictment was imminent of him
2984606 it had never been made clear to him nor to us that he was the suspect
2984607 asset management firms processing high data volumes and spread across the globe need highly available real time data access and analysis to support better decision making our customers can now depend on us for innovative solutions in grid computing and extreme transaction processing xtp which is the need of the hour the alliance will strengthen our off shore and near shore based delivery and support teams
2984608 im a survivor and if i can live through all that has happened to me so can other women
2984609 i received counselling access to food health education and that is how i survived the trauma she told ips
2984610 in december 2007 post election violence broke out in kenya and we had to flee our homes to take refuge in camps
2984611 for three weeks i didnt have access to my medication i feared going back to my home to fetch the medicine
2984612 it was terrible i thought id die not of aids but of the conflict
2984613 we had just one blanket to share among the six of us her five children and there was a serious food crisis
2984614 but not before at least ten among us had died
2984615 we have found no clear link between conflict and hiv
2984616 data from these countries did not show an increase in prevalence of hiv infection during periods of conflict irrespective of prevalence when the conflict began
2984617 low transmission rates of hiv infection through sexual intercourse lower hiv rates among assailants than previously believed or reduction in social mobility during conflict
2984618 limited funds personnel and interventions towards other groups and programmes in different contexts that may have larger public health effects
2984619 press exaggerates that the effect is large spiegel said the study he added was aimed at policy makers so that interventions are based on evidence and not on what is assumed to take place based on small studies
2984620 take the case of afghanistan which has a low hiv prevalence rate and where you cant really talk about hiv and aids but it has all the ingredients that can topple the situation the problem of injecting drug use is prevalent there is gender inequality gender based violence is pervasive has poor infrastructure and rampant illiteracy
2984621 after a war or conflict has ended as communities try to pull themselves together and you see increased mobility of people including the military when people migrate to urban centres looking for jobs the infrastructure is being built and the country has suddenly opened the chances of vulnerabilities to the virus increases
2984622 the power struggle increases boredom sets in and sex is the one thing men still have control over this often leads to gender violence
2984623 at times after conflict people want to procreate because they have so many dying perry said
2984624 i was in congo last year and much to my dismay i found that rape and sexual violence had become common and is now a cultural norm i went to msf medicines sans frontiers and found seven cases of rape of children all under nine years of age
2984625 unless all ngos and other agencies remain engaged and their interventions have thought out policies that are specially on the side of women and girls we wont be able to address pervasive gender based violence said robinson

2984644 i understand why the republicans think they have that issue but the vast majority of the american people blame george bush and the oil companies for high gas prices
2984645 so i think that is an issue that ultimately will not help them

2984651 i think thats the important bit its all well and good me saying no that im not going after playing for a long time but itd be unfair to put a daniel flynn or a tim southee in that position
2984652 for me personally i want to make sure that its a collective decision and not put in front of young guys because the young guys probably dont have the same options as the more experienced players
2984653 i know that theyll put players safety concerns first before they make a decision about turning up to the tournament
2984654 i was only there for a short period of time but i really enjoyed his coaching style hes a guy who had a good knowledge of the game obviously it was only twenty20 but hes been successful with victoria and he had success with delhi
2984655 hes got a pretty simplistic style but it was one that i enjoyed while i was there hell be one of the guys that new zealand cricket will have a good look at
2984656 im pretty sure he hasnt applied but things can change with wrighty so well wait and see

2984691 you know that once the protection of the zionists is over people will enter your headquarters and kick you out
2984692 we are not acting against you now in the west bank because we know the zionists will immediately back you
2984693 we have no idea exactly how many people with disabilities are hiv positive how many are educated about the risks of hiv aids or how many are able to access treatment
2984694 this lack of data highlights the neglect of people with disabilities and makes it extremely difficult to obtain funding or to strategically design policies and programming to reach this population the fact is that people with disabilities are dying silently of aids
2984695 if people with disabilities are left out of aids research policies and programming then we are relegating 10 per cent of the worlds population to the far margins of the aids response
2984696 the recent sharp retreat in oil and commodity prices later on in the month clearly started to feed through in the overall july input data and it should show up far more in the august data
2984697 it seems therefore that the year on year rise in input prices peaked at 30 8 per cent in june
2984698 modestly relieved overall with the july producer price inflation data
2984699 but the bank is very far from out of the inflation woods yet with consumer price inflation still likely to near 5 0 per cent later this year
2984700 consequently we still suspect that the bank of england will be reluctant to cut interest rates until early 2009 despite the fact that the economy now seems more likely than not to contract over the second half of this year
2984701 while national geographic can easily be considered the place to go if youre looking for photos of life on earth if youre interested in whats happening away from our planet youll have to turn to nasa and thanks to a partnership with the non profit internet archive accessing nasas image and video libraries just got a whole lot easier the nasa images website went live this past week and features 21 nasa image collections merged into a massive and easily searchable online resource over the next 5 years the partnership will see millions of photos and thousands of hours of video added to the site including imagery from the apollo missions the hubble space telescope and experimental aircraft and spacecraft spanning nasas history unfortunately while the site appears to be getting hit pretty hard at the moment in other words its almost unusably slow it does appear to be well laid out and will most likely end up occupying a good chunk of my weekend
2984702 i just happened to have the swim of my life at the right time
2984703 it was one of those moments where you just sit back and say jesus christ if i wouldnt have seen lezak overtaking bernard with my own eyes i wouldnt have believed it
2984704 theres never been an anchor swim like that in my memory
2984705 not running down somebody who holds the world record whos on their game that was incredible it has to be in the unbelievable category thats the biggest word i know
2984706 jason is the most phenomenal closer ive ever seen in my life
2984707 hes been able to get his hand on the wall from behind from ahead
2984708 its happened to me all my career that people would get on my lane line and suck off me
2984709 so i figured this was one opportunity in all my career to do that im not going to lie when i flipped at the 50 it really crossed my mind for a split second that there was no way then i changed and i said you know what thats ridiculous at the olympics im here for the united states of america i dont care how bad it hurts or whatever honestly in five seconds i was thinking all these things i got like a supercharge and took it from there
2984710 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2984711 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2984712 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2984713 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2984714 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2984715 no decision has been taken by the civil aviation safety authority on changing the procedures to be used in airspace when normal air traffic control services are not available
2984716 casa will not allow any changes to be made to current procedures unless it can be demonstrated they will enhance operations
2984717 airservices australia maintains that the use of a procedure known as traffic information broadcast by aircraft tiba when air traffic control services are temporarily unavailable is safe
2984718 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2984719 there is a frisian folktale about a young man whose father sent him into the world with an oar over his shoulder and who was only allowed to stop roaming when he came to a land where people would ask him what is that strange stick youve got there
2984720 would it be economical to take pillows and blankets off aircraft
2984721 we are going to take pillows and blankets off the aircraft were looking at selling a combo pillow and blanket pack onboard were down to three potential vendors and are getting really close to a decision probably sometime during the fourth quarter we dont want to take the current product off until we can offer something as a replacement
2984722 es fundamental decirle al mercado que se equivoca cuando piensa que vamos a defaultear en tres meses por eso queremos dejar en claro que no s lo tenemos voluntad de pago sino que tambi n tenemos capacidad para hacer frente a los vencimientos
2984723 rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future

2984725 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
2984726 the treadmill was running but he was unresponsive lying on the floor
2984727 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2984728 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2984729 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
2984730 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
2984731 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2984732 but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins
2984733 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
2984734 i think it was just desserts on a day we played exceptionally well
2984735 i think that is his first goal in about 12 seasons
2984736 and i hope its the start of it i hope his goals come like buses in twos and threes
2984737 he deserved his goal today has willie he played exceptionally well hes risen to the challenge with the players weve brought in but the old man has come through
2984738 der abschied wie bedr ngt wie tr be aus deinen blicken sprach dein herz in deinem k ssen welche liebe o welche wonne welche schmerz du gingst ich stunde und sah zur erden und sah dir nach mit nassem blick und doch welche gl ck geliebt zu werden und lieben g tter welche ein gl ck
2984739 this is wonderful opportunity for little girls to come and meet one of the hottest young stars in the movies and on the disney channel and to meet many of the top female women football players in the world advertisement the h town cyclones are the top womens football team in the world having just won the world championship last month in memphis we believe this movie will really get young girls excited about playing full contact football
2984740 i thought the boy showed fantastic focus a great attitude to work hard and they are qualities to give any player an outstanding chance in the game
2984741 de acordo com informa o das for as de manuten o da paz na oss tia do sul a ge rgia continua a usar a for a militar e por isso n o podemos considerar este documento
2984742 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2984743 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2984744 the hope of the christian must be like the hope of a child pure and full of trust the child is totally available in the present because he she has relatively little to remember his her experience of evil is as yet brief and his her anticipation of the future does not extend far
2984745 he she cannot see the world with childlike innocence and simplicity unless his her memory is cleared of past evils by forgiveness
2984746 you risk the backlash from the people from the legacy that was left in africa because of the era of colonialism
2984747 one they take greater business risk and two they dont attach the political conditions that the west tends to impose
2984748 im not sure that the drc had much choice for a deal this big it was either go with china or take an arrangement that would have had so many conditions attached to it it would have been unacceptable
2984749 it is really a shame that europeans who have powerful construction and energy companies speak the language of the people and are accustomed to working in africa hiring locals did not offer an exchange similar to the chinese
2984750 if you subtract out oil investment there isnt much left
2984751 wir sollten nicht zu viel rechnen das geht sowieso meistens nach hinten los

2984756 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
2984757 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
2984758 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
2984759 we should definitely take steps to limit our exposure to the substance
2984760 anything we can do to reduce bisphenol a could potentially have big payoffs to protecting human health

2984767 in respect of the charges we will let the industry decide although a rm25 ceiling has been set
2984768 the real problem is not the cost of money so much as the availability of it will bankers lend to each other and to new and old customers on that simple question all our futures may well hinge

2984771 mobile cameras are a nice idea because you always have them with you but the thing about them is that the picture quality can look almost as grainy as the apollo 15 mission i dont think anyone would entrust their lifes memories to a cell phone camera
2984772 the fact that you have a phone with you all the time is a very powerful thing take for example the london tube bombing people on the scene were able to take pictures so they have a security application also
2984773 the unique challenge posed by the mobile phone camera is that everything must be really really small and really cheap you cant go charging say us 200 for the camera part of the mobile handset there is definitely a unique set of challenges
2984774 we have been focusing on making an entire camera for between us 1 and us 2 sure its not your nikon professional but it is a very cheap and small 3mm camera with a lot of applications including in the medical field
2984775 championship teams play for things larger than themselves the history and tradition of the institution the quest for perfection or the love of their teammates and their coaches i wanted every member of the 1988 team to internalize all of those motivators
2984776 i couldnt believe this little man was holding me down
2984777 i think the adversity we ran into at the end of last season taught us a few things and showed us where we needed to be if we wanted to have a chance against the better teams in the country
2984778 their quarterback did an excellent job running the option and his throwing gives them another dimension right at this point id have to say theyre the best weve faced including southern california
2984779 ive heard all about the notre dame mystique but this is absolutely ridiculous
2984780 you have to believe in your coaches and do exactly what they tell you you also have to believe in the spirit of notre dame there have been plenty of other games where notre dame teams have played number one ranked teams and won you have to believe it will happen again
2984781 notre dame blog with a dash of class and sophistication
2984782 were doing everything in our power everything we can do to have a successful recovery
2984783 it was disbelief because one second he was there and you just turn your eyes and he was gone
2984784 there was a big wave that came and took us all under
2984785 you couldnt see anything the wind was unbelievable sand everywhere and in just a matter of seconds he was pulled under and swept away
2984786 i tried to save him but he was just too far away
2984787 el partido contra las suecas nos brindar un choque cl sico entre la organizaci n y la t ctica que representa la selecci n de suecia y nuestro juego vertical y veloz

2984798 ive never seen anything like this in my career for software
2984799 phone differentiation used to be about radios and antennas and things like that

2984807 i was in a little bit of a panic because you know the injury you know it really hurt
2984808 but when i was on the ground it kind of eased out a little bit it could have been adrenaline or whatever

2984823 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
2984824 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
2984825 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
2984826 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will

2984836 bij aviapartner klaagt het personeel al weken over de werkdruk er kwam geen antwoord van de directie dus werd beslist te staken
2984837 het eerste overleg vanmorgen leverde niets op de directie deed zelfs geen voorstel
2984838 daar hebben ze naast de werkdruk ook nog te kampen met abominabele werkomstandigheden
2984839 er is voorlopig geen verder overleg gepland de personeelsdirecteur van flightcare heeft zich zelfs opgesloten en weigert zelfs voor september met de bonden te praten
2984840 de werkdruk uit zich bij arbeiders in rugproblemen en bij de bedienden in stress er moet ook meer personeel bijkomen geen interims of jobstudenten maar effectieven daarnaast moet de verloning beter momenteel worden hier de minimumlonen betaald en gaat het vaak om deeltijdse contracten ook de vergoeding voor overuren moet fors hoger
2984841 al ons personeel ook dat van de administratieve diensten wordt op het terrein ingezet zo delen we bijvoorbeeld water uit aan de wachtende passagiers
2984842 we proberen ook zo goed mogelijk iedereen te informeren maar dat is geen sinecure
2984843 is je vlucht geannuleerd kom dan zeker niet in andere gevallen contacteer je best je luchtvaartmaatschappij
2984844 de sociale pesterijen bij flightcare zijn al jaren aan de gang de directie perst het personeel uit als citroenen

2984861 the demand for the service of large construction companies is falling and poland with its political and budget stability becomes a very attractive place for such firms
2984862 we have to remember we got the games thanks to ukraine in the first place
2984863 so we have to keep patient and we still have time to stick to ukraine ukraine doesnt have the luxury of the european union funds and is only a few years after transformation
2984864 i am travelling to ukraine this week to talk this all over again and for an update on the kiev stadium i assume after platinis july visit everybody worked hard in ukraine and the progress will be significant
2984865 even if from the formal point of view poland could host the games alone from the political technical and sports point of view the games should take place in poland and ukraine together
2984866 during a recent customer panel i attended it was obvious that many travelers are not aware of all the tools that they could be using to find better deals

2984879 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
2984880 even in his later years he never hesitated to appear for a cause or endorse something that he felt was for the good of mankind he will be sorely missed
2984881 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2984882 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2984883 a lot of artists owe isaac his career because a lot of music was based on his foundation
2984884 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2984885 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins
2984886 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians

2984891 if the children are untaught their ignorance and vices will in future life cost us much dearer in their consequences than it would have done in their correction by a good education
2984892 education reform is the civil rights issue of our time
2984893 she was doing so many lines she didnt even know where she was

2984895 i can not tell you what exactly is the medical problem with him because i am not a physician but a coach to me what matters is the word of our doctor he is the one telling me who is fit to play and who isnt so i left konstantinov out of the list
2984896 as far as i know we left him at the olympic village after i decided not to include him on the teams starting list we we came back after the game with china he was gone i dont know where he is right now but i dont think he has gone back to bulgaria
2984897 i was told all about konstantinovs problem and it is not about doping or conflicts and fights within the team
2984898 there was a post on here awhile back announcing that theyd give out visas at the china pakistan border but i really dont think thats true a similar rumor circulates every few years
2984899 every expenditure has been in the context of fighting poverty
2984900 its very important for unions not to do this kind of thing
2984901 union leadership is a public trust all the more so when the people being represented are among the lowest paid in america
2984902 as far as i can determine the international union has not received allegations concerning freemans local if the international union receives allegations about a local that warrant further action we have internal union procedures for handling them
2984903 any money that was left over after paying staff and expenses went back into the company
2984904 at one time it was on our website i do remember that
2984905 and then that was it i mean and the word goes out i stayed away from it
2984906 she wasnt my mother in law when she got the contract
2984907 its disconnected from the world of the people theyre representing no ones playing golf whos a home healthcare worker
2984908 if he didnt raise it he wouldnt have got it
2984909 a strong relationship with the california community foundation and they are currently building 13 new homes
2984910 to have a family like the winn family embrace that understand it and promote it all theyre doing is very gratifying for us because it helps us do our jobs better
2984911 i didnt want to set a world record but i felt good in the water
2984912 we will be there because we deal with inbev and weve got to tell the american workers that were together and we dont intend to let them suffer from the acquisition
2984913 we dont want labor problems but were also going to be a force to be reckoned with
2984914 couldnt agree with you more that the teamsters and the anheuser busch employees play an instrumental role in success and it is our fervent hope that they will continue to do so
2984915 think there were incidents of abuse they should go to the irs
2984916 that suggest that there is an ongoing practice of comingling of taxpayer funds with political projects
2984917 he drove up and tried to get me and said did i need a ride
2984918 i was scared and i want my child as well as other children to be safe while theyre waiting at the bus stop for the bus
2984919 its not safe anywhere today no matter where you live
2984920 its the first time in two years the knights have won three in a row we are a bit disappointed about that but it is nice to get it off our back now
2984921 the two tries we conceded in the last five minutes before half time and full time were a bit disappointing
2984922 but you got to keep winning if we hadnt won we would have been back with all those teams at the back end
2984923 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
2984924 these ahc affidavits are further evidence in a growing litany of potentially illegal abuses of taxpayer dollars by acorn and ahc members of congress who recently doled out millions of dollars to these groups in the housing bailout bill need to ask some serious questions to ensure that those taxpayer dollars are being spent properly and not illegally supporting political activity or being squandered by an organization with an already checkered past of voter fraud and embezzlement in addition to the affidavits these former employees have offered to assist any investigation with additional information it is time for congress hud and others to exercise proper oversight and investigate these entities before millions more in public funds are wasted
2984925 not only did we find references to acorn having created ahc to serve purposes common to both organizations we noted numerous transactions and activities involving fraternal acorn related corporations
2984926 total funding from huds fair housing initiatives this year is about 650 000 which will provide a good opportunity for acorn and ahc to work together on housing issues and campaigns
2984927 its sad because were a family really once your kid makes the australian team and youd really want to be in there celebrating with all the others
2984928 libby and all these kids have been sort of like our kids 20 years ago
2984929 because youve got all the media along one side and its sort of all empty and youve got all the spectators along one side
2984930 as a longtime friend of labor unions i must raise my voice against pending legislation i see as a disturbing and undemocratic overreach not in the interest of either management or labor
2984931 under efca workers could lose the freedom to express their will in private the right to make a decision without anyone peering over their shoulder free from fear of reprisal
2984932 unless you call 1 877 878 7279 to cancel during the 30 day period in which case your orchard bank credit card will not be charged
2984933 good luck in new york state but we cant pay the taxes
2984934 you sort of feel like they are coming at you from all directions so you are constantly being thrown back on your heels
2984935 youll continue to see a high degree of flux for probably the next several years
2984936 even if i were starting from scratch today i still think id bet on javascript and ajax its going to be hard to stop the massive momentum we have
2984937 flash is seeing a pretty aggressive growth cycle now but i still think javascript is going to be used in 10 times the number of flash apps that launch
2984938 its amazing what people have done with html which was never intended to do rich internet applications and flash was originally created for lightweight animation literally for mickey mouse on the web
2984939 but these technologies were designed for something else and people are really hacking them to do more
2984940 if you put it all together that lends itself to ajax being a very powerful capable rich internet application technology
2984941 if you look at google apps theyre doing great things but how many shops out there have the ajax chops that google does
2984942 we expect gears to be widely adopted in products like gmail
2984943 access the file system make system calls into the computer drag and drop access the webcam
2984944 gears can be ahead of the curve trying out new ideas that eventually become a new standard
2984945 nothing really comes close to the kind of desktop experience we have in picnik
2984946 itll take an incredibly long time to see it implemented across browsers and a long time to see high level of compatibility where you can really rely on it without a huge productivity drain on developers
2984947 with adobes rev of flash player version 10 theyve done a remarkable job of knocking out key things we had a conversation a year and a half ago where we gave them a wish list they have been really responsive
2984948 if they take a similar sized leap in short order say a years time frame they could be in the game
2984949 if they are the first to nail 3d that could give developers a lot of reasons to use their technologies
2984950 were going to be iterating pretty quickly and each version is going to add new features and functionality
2984951 what was once a certainty for endorsements of republican incumbents is not a certainty anymore
2984952 but in this case its not just the republicans its the democrats as well
2984953 they 1199 are absolutely solid in their support and there is no concern that with the new leader sen dean skelos there will be any change in the commitment to health care
2984954 the core name is and will be our flagship pc processor brand going forward expect intel to focus even more marketing resources around that name and the core i7 products starting now
2984955 its an almost perfect example of the streisand effect named after the attempt by barbra of that ilk to prevent her house appearing on the internet
2984956 pana in anul 2010 vom fi foarte aproape de productia in serie si intentionam sa pornim cu un numar limitat de cateva sute de unitati

2984958 it is appropriate in our view that the indian refining industry which has world sized companies be placed on par with the international refining business
2984959 we are studying the report that the chaturvedi committee submitted and it will be premature to presume that the suggestions made by the committee were being implemented we have to do a thorough analysis before we even think of implementing them
2984960 it is appropriate in our view that the indian refining industry which has world sized companies be placed on par with the international refining business

2984966 many people will wonder how energy companies can enjoy such a massive subsidy at a time when we are all finding it harder to pay our energy bills
2984967 this multi billion pound windfall should be used to protect the most vulnerable people from the effects of fuel poverty
2984968 if action is not taken now then many families are going to face an increasingly tough time paying their bills this winter
2984969 everyone i meet is worried about rising prices there is also a lot of fear about job losses and the threat of repossessions as house prices fall people want to see action from gordon brown but nothing seems to be happening
2984970 gordon brown and labour are simply out of touch with real life in reading and elsewhere
2984971 recent rises in energy prices are due to a range of factors including increased demand in the developing world increased scarcity and the need for more investment in renewable sources of energy we all accept that we may have to pay a bit more for energy at this time
2984972 but is it really legitimate for hard pressed pensioners and families to be faced with an increase in bills of over a third especially since this comes at the same time as a massive increase in the dividends paid out to shareholders of centrica british gass parent company
2984973 just 24 hours after centrica regretted bumping up bills by 35 per cent the company paid out 144 6 million to its shareholders thats a 16 per cent jump in dividends compared to last year
2984974 labour brought in the winter fuel allowance which has benefited hundreds of pensioners living in reading east
2984975 the standards were very high so i felt it was quite an achievement to get to the final
2984976 it was a great experience i have definitely learnt a lot from the competition and look forward to our customers trying apricot sundown in the bar
2984977 that is terrible just terrible i have nothing to do with these weapons i wish i had not been so nosy and never gone up there
2984978 i do not know anything about them i just heard the name of the guns
2984979 however if hypothetically the announcement was to be made dramatically via cellphone texts e mails and the obama website the two candidates would not need to be together and if it came oh say sometime this week it would instantly dominate the news stream and erase any advantage republican sen john mccain might have gotten from a week of campaigning without the democrats competition then the two democratic running mates could appear together later at another event and get a bonus second publicity boost

2984983 that means he will not be undergoing any surgery rather he will undergo extensive rehabilitating to strengthen the muscles around the knee and hopefully he will be fit for the end of year tour
2984984 theres no cancellations out of the canadian side or the european side but the american cancellations are killing everybody
2984985 theres more competition in a time of the year thats important to canadian tourism
2984986 traditionally the dollar was 65 cents and fuel costs were low and so it was easy and we got spoiled for sure
2984987 ten years ago there were 40 to 60 nations really promoting their countries for tourism in an aggressive way and now weve got 100 countries promoting themselves and they also look to the u s as a very affluent economy
2984988 it would be hard for abc not to make a play for leno
2984989 he is still at the top of his game and the thinking is that a lot of ad dollars would follow him to another network
2984990 there was a widely held perception that the show would fail without ted koppel
2984991 very few people thought the show would survive and even fewer thought it would thrive
2984992 the show is starting to matter again just as it once did
2984993 my hope is that we are going to see nightline enter a new golden era
2984994 we make a nice amount of money we are doing significantly better from where we were just a few years ago
2984995 a more narrow audience and a more narrow group of advertisers
2984996 and then you cross the border and think these people need some help here

2985098 additionally sprint nextels iden wireless network is used by public safety workers something that may worry some washington security officials particularly in an election season which is right around the corner
2985099 the challenge is that sprints financial situation no matter what its representatives claim is not strong
2985100 it isnt any secret that the company has been struggling with lost revenue and lost customers while google could in effect turn it around the real question is does it want to take on the role of savior where sprint is concerned
2985101 i tend to think it does make sense for google to make such an acquisition and i hope they do it soon because i have no faith that our government would stop other large wireless providers from picking sprint up and in doing so reducing competition by that much more
2985102 but according to a cnbc report sprint nextel is already in talks to sell the network to former nextel communications inc subsidiary nii holdings inc or to private equity investors
2985103 the report did not name any sources and said that the sale isnt expected any time soon others have reported that interested parties could include the public safety community which currently relies on the iden network for some of their services this possibility has been questioned as the current iteration of sprint nextels iden network was not constructed to handle the possible load capacity of the public safety community in times of a disaster

2985110 lets recount the reasons why the network is outdated slow and doesnt have any logical upgrade path to 3g customers are leaving in droves its integrated with sprints operations and it still has to give back a portion of its spectrum to the fcc for emergency communications
2985111 without nextel sprint would lose about 14 6 million subscribers which would leave it with about 37 million or roughly 7 million more than its next closest competitor t mobile usa

2985118 should inspire confidence among all indian sportspersons that they can achieve the pinnacle of any sports at the international level and be also inspiration for more of our youths to take up sports as a full time career

2985148 ive missed two of the three games with richmond senior since andrew has been on the varsity he said

2985151 xavier nixon loves grapes he said of britts standout offensive lineman
2985152 i aspire to be as strong as him and tough in all areas of life he said
2985153 i knew it drove him crazy to be as uninvolved as he was just going to the games i was happy for him that hes found a way to get a little more satisfaction feeling a part of the team
2985154 he could play linebacker for us but hes sacrificed for the team to play offensive line bailey said
2985155 hes a little undersized to be a lineman 6 1 220 but hes tough as nails
2985156 hes gotten them from all the ivy league schools bailey said
2985157 i dont know what level of football he can play but he would be a valuable member of any team because hes that kind of kid
2985158 its important for our family as much as it is for the team andrew said
2985159 its a last chance to get a ring im just ready to get going

2985163 what were doing is saving infants who probably would have been stillborn before
2985164 now were saving them at earlier and earlier gestational ages providing intensive care and some of them make it and some of them dont
2985165 over time the american diet lifestyle health behavioral risks all of those things add up and erode that advantage they started with
2985166 there must be pockets of residents that have some kind of a characteristic that is contributing to a higher infant mortality whether thats substance abuse or something else
2985167 i just cant tell you because we havent done that specific of an analysis
2985168 see if there is anything that might suggest an environmental exposure
2985169 the parents knew this was going to happen but said we want to get to know her before she goes

2985197 what a disgrace to music lovers its gorgeous here too
2985198 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2985199 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2985200 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world
2985201 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2985202 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area
2985203 we hope that there is no further bloodshed there has been too much bloodshed already
2985204 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2985205 it has to be condemned and the world needs to stand against it

2985208 when we saw it we said jim youve got a product here
2985209 theres lots of cities just like us that need this technology
2985210 it seemed so simple we wondered why we didnt think of it before
2985211 i think fuel usage wise its a really smart system
2985212 given the fuel prices i would not be surprised if some of the waste companies as well communities that handle waste are looking more seriously at this type of system
2985213 so this is paying for itself more than we ever anticipated it would when we were developing it
2985214 i have always been fascinated by caricature and other aspects of humor in drawing
2985215 were always looking for new ways to display our collection and by employing the theme of humor we were able to exhibit drawings from a wide range of time periods while showing interesting connections between seemingly disparate artists
2985216 thomas rowlandsons box lobby loungers for example contains elements of both caricature and satire
2985217 its satirical of the english gentry but it also has several caricatures within it such as the leering old man in the foreground
2985218 people think of leonardo and think of his religious paintings they certainly dont think of humorous drawings
2985219 but he was a master of observation and he used his skills to create interesting caricature he can be credited with inventing the genre leonardo was fascinated by human physiognomy and he believed it expressed the character of the person he consistently drew and his notebooks were filled with small sketches and notes on peoples features
2985220 caricature comes from the italian verb caricare which means to charge a caricature is a charged portrait
2985221 this drawing subverts the classical profile portrait which was used to exemplify nobility and often highlighted the nose and the chin in this drawing leonardo exaggerated those features we see a close observation of human nature and then a distortion of it all in a tiny drawing
2985222 in earlier drawings the humor tended to be more personal to the artist
2985223 beginning in the late 16th century the idea that drawings can be subversive and make a political point comes into play
2985224 in this exhibition you can see great artists having fun one michelangelo sketch sheet of studies not shown is the reverse side of a religious drawing and shows exaggerated sketches of a birds head as well as a quickly drawn lewd scene of putti it can be surprising to see that an artist such as michelangelo did doodles just as we do today
2985225 in contemptuous of the insults he created what is essentially a self portrait in which he is a debonair man contemptuous of these tiny caricatures of napoleonic soldiers
2985226 in this piece he is working through his own fear of the french occupation of spain
2985227 leonardos piece is done in this medium which allows for quick detail on a small scale

2985239 i think the economy is shot to pieces on both sides
2985240 it doesnt really make any difference the cost of living is much higher here i think than it is in america and the pound being strong you see that its very evident but really i think its down to each side to try and find a solution
2985241 theres a hell of a lot going on life has changed were working very hard weve got to
2985242 americans tend to be quite insular in their view of the world
2985243 the only comparisons americans can make are on the basis of their own experience as far as a year ago or on the basis of someone who lives an hour away by plane where as in europe nations border nations and so youre constantly comparing yourself if you live in denmark youre comparing prices in germany or france its just part of life
2985244 more than half the money i pay at the petrol pump over 60 percent is for taxes and duty
2985245 actually only 32 percent when its unleaded petrol is for the product itself
2985246 so we have the same heritage you do in america public transport in australia is nothing like it is here we lived in denmark for 10 years and thats an even better example of public transport at its best you get the clean trains on time all the time buses that will take you anywhere pretty much cabs cost more most people were content to use buses we were paying 60 percent of our income in tax plus 25 percent vat on everything we bought so you get what you pay for
2985247 but i think the new generation of america is much more aware ecologically than their predecessors and i think there is an entrepreneurship in america that will drive the development of new fuel sources new types of cars when it comes to the environment i think were yet to see the power of america to change it through sheer inventiveness the same people who invented the chevrolet can reinvent the car with that same pioneer spirit with that same can do attitude some of that is happening in europe but im looking forward to seeing it happen more in america

2985307 do you think its important that the reader consumer knows its marketing or not advertorial versus content ads
2985308 marketing is listening advertising is talking cant have one without the other did i just imply advertising will never die
2985309 what do you call conversation between consumer and brand then and david came back with brands are deities not entities so have to pray for help brands need to be nihilists so that people can prey on them seriously people talk to each other brand has to inspire their conversation how can brand have dialogue when its not an entity

2985311 i dont mind it and i dont mind other people having it ive had botox because i want to be the best i can be and look the nicest i can look theres no right and wrong its a personal choice it didnt make me happier though i think if you link any form of cosmetic surgery into happiness then youre never going to be happy its not about being perfect and thats where people get it wrong if youre thinking about getting surgery to be perfect then youre never going to be happy
2985312 i had such a hard time being the new girl last year and i didnt want her to suffer the same sharon and i just didnt click she made constant comments about me saying i was just there because of my looks it was upsetting because ive watched and loved all her stuff and always picked her out as a real womans woman but i didnt have that experience with her its hard to admire someone and then have your illusions shattered
2985313 sharon was the least of my problems last year right when kylie was given the all clear my best friend died of cancer it was the most painful thing ive ever had to deal with
2985314 i knew if anyone asked me a question about it i would literally melt so i had to keep it private and thats not me i hate bottling things up i was an absolute mess i really looked up to kylie and i saw there is a time and place to deal with your emotions and its not publicly
2985315 it was such a year of learning about myself i learnt i have this very quiet strength inside i didnt realise i had if you spend ten minutes wallowing you have to make yourself put the same time and effort into thinking life is great its the only way
2985316 yes we have plans to duet its about finding the right thing and the right time i miss singing so im planning to do some more next year
2985317 im enjoying myself but im not great with women dude im not a closer
2985318 i can chat all night long but im not the guy who goes okay back to my room
2985319 what might bring me back is if obama becomes president
2985320 my ideal man is a 16 year old chris martin but my mum says i have terrible taste
2985321 to be honest it was when i was afraid that people would recognise me that i was recognised much more
2985322 when i first arrived in london i was much more afraid of that so i stayed in
2985323 im not the same person i was god has given me this new chance
2985324 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2985325 hi im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
2985326 if we can just hang on until 2010 things will be better
2985327 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
2985328 as the person who knows him best michelle will talk about the barack obama she knows and loves the values that drive him and why she believes hell be an extraordinary president
2985329 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2985330 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2985331 i thought it would have been a great nod to our western heritage and we could talk about western values as we move forward

2985333 in 1908 denver was trying to have it both ways
2985334 i think thats part of our civic psychology its deep in our civic dna
2985335 were trying to show off the kind of flavor of what the west has to offer
2985336 the fact is our economy now is extremely diversified resilient and contemporary
2985337 people assume an international cosmopolitan image is at variance with the notion of being a cow town
2985338 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling
2985339 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
2985340 we are proud to have published two best selling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country
2985341 avoid the times when there have been really rancorous debates in the confirmation process

2985343 by michelle hughes a chicago adoption attorney and co founder of a company specializing in diversity training for multiracial families
2985344 well written article and so very true as for obama you have spoken the words i as a white female have been complaining about for over a year now why cant obama come out and proclaim himself as biracial its who he is and as a white woman i am insulted that he has not yet defined himself this way the accurate and correct way
2985345 los que defienden la idea de que la financiaci n debe proporcionarse solamente para los mejores aducen en primer lugar que los recursos son limitados y que es m s eficiente o m s productivo emplearlos en quienes tienen la mayor probabilidad de xito para ellos el xito consiste en que los j venes se grad en con notas satisfactorias otro argumento que esgrimen a favor de esta idea es que se debe premiar a los estudiantes acad micamente m s destacados en preferencia a los mediocres

2985430 heading into the early 90s they aerosmith had to be wondering how they could possibly compete in the mtv video age with up and coming stars like eddie vedder and kirk kurt cobain guys who were half their age their answer was to cast two beautiful young actresses alicia silverstone and liv tyler to star in the videos meanwhile steve tyler joe perry and the other aerosmith guys were more or less in the background of these videos it worked the videos for cryin amazing and crazy were huge hits on mtv and aerosmith successfully launched a second or was it their third career comeback by teaming their music with younger images aerosmith successfully marketed their music to a new generation who otherwise might have viewed them as old fogies
2985431 nat rlich ist auch f r mich eine medaille m glich
2985432 ich werde versuchen von tor zu tor noch ein bisserl mehr risiko zu gehen enger ranzufahren die aufw rtstore mehr zu attackieren und damit vielleicht die eine sekunde die noch m glich ist rauszuholen
2985433 im ersten lauf lagen dem 2 und dem 18 platz nur zwei sekunden ich wusste ich muss im zweiten die gleiche leistung bringen und das ist mir gelungen ich habe zwei drei kleine fehler ausgebessert und ich war auch eineinhalb sekunden schneller zweimal so runterkommen das ist sehr gut
2985434 ich habe gehofft dass schwieriger und technischer wird und alles ein bisserl weiter auseinander ist aber ich komme trotzdem ganz gut damit zurecht
2985435 die tore 3 4 und 5 sind schwieriger ich freue mich drauf morgen mit dem druck dass jeder eine medaille machen will werden mehr fehler passieren und darauf hoffe ich und ich hoffe nat rlich ich mache keinen
2985436 es geht morgen wieder bei null los alle zehn leute die ins finale kommen werden eine chance auf eine medaille haben
2985437 ich will eine gute leistung bringen wenn ich 15 bin dann habe ich auch nichts davon ich bin gl cklicher wenn ich vierter werde ich m chte nicht blind drauf los fahren sondern zeigen was ich kann und nat rlich ist auch f r mich eine medaille m glich

2985439 my boyfriend is the real gardener i just buy lots of plants that i get excited about and he tends to them much more than i do i just like watching them grow id say im most excited by our three vines that are growing like crazy i am a tad impatient so i love the plants that grow really fast
2985440 edward drostes lo fi songs for grizzly bear are reveries in metamorphosis they drift from rustic folky fingerpicking to apocalyptic surges of guitar distortion stopping off along the way for orchestrated passages and gorgeous cascading vocal harmonies
2985441 weve been doing shows in between radiohead shows to make a little money to pay for the bus we got our first ever and we havent played williamsburg as a headliner since glasslands way before yellow house came out seemed like a fun thing to do we are donating portions of the proceeds to that specific charity because our friends at daytrotter wanted us to come out to iowa to play for the cause but we were busy with this tour so thats when we decided we should do a show to help out a bit im really glad we did too i was excited to learn it sold out in a few hours as thats never happened to us before
2985442 the typhoon was monitored as a category eight which by law obliged all shops offices and public transport to be closed
2985443 nel momento in cui rifletto sui colori costruisco concetti e formulo frasi la loro atmosfera si dissolve e nelle mie mani rimane solo il loro corpo
2985444 do you think you could be persuaded by a politicians story over their policies
2985445 barack obama has told one story that he will bring change and hope
2985446 but whereas the standard democratic response is to throw more plans and positions against the wall and hope that theyll stick thats missing the point that obama hasnt yet told a coherent consistent narrative of who he is that weaves together the themes of his campaign with his own life history
2985447 his campaign needs to understand why that happened because its the same thing that happened to al gore and john kerry its about narratives
2985448 there is a simple fact about elections that has eluded democrats in every presidential campaign they have lost in the last 40 years that as a candidate you have to focus first and foremost not on a litany of
2985449 john mccain is telling a story about himself that hes a man of courage and conviction who loves his country he is telling a story about obama that hes a man of none of those things after watching obama enthrall the rest of the world and the troops mccain claims obama doesnt support last week he is now in full attack mode trying to tell a story about his opponents greatest strength that obama is someone who can inspire people and can even do so on a world stage where mccains master narrative had claimed a decided advantage so now he is telling the story of obama as an arrogant uppity empty celebrity
2985450 it is a huge and exciting project and with tenders already being sent out for the contractors and designers our work has already started
2985451 there will be three tunnels to be bored and with tunnelling there are always risks and challenges especially when you consider that these will be in the heart of a major city
2985452 the second is the fact that as part of the project there will be nine new stations constructed and some of those stations will be deep underground in effect each station will have a core box and the risks for the station construction are a considerable part of the project
2985453 lastly is the rolling stock the trains which will operate on the line are being built specially and they will be stored in preparation for the service to begin it leaves us with a major accumulation issue should they be damaged or destroyed by fire or explosion prior to coming into service
2985454 the history aspect is a risk but we are also in a situation where the route will go close to existing london underground tunnels and stations and there is the risk of impacting on their operation if there is any problems
2985455 the other factor is that the crossrail project will be well underway by the time london hosts the 2012 olympics and areas such as the movement of earth from the tunnels may need to be handled carefully given the fact that the city will want to look pristine for the games
2985456 it is fair to say that lloyds and the rest of the london market will assume much of the risk
2985457 the major markets for these risks are in london and we would assume that they will be keen to play a part on the programme
2985458 he whispered into her ear and she listened with rapt attention he brushed his hand on her back they had nice chemistry
2985459 we have received several representations to revisit the spreads we are looking into it
2985460 probably the thinking now is to slow domestic demand but the willingness to revisit the spreads is a positive development without it smaller firms are facing problems to raise funds
2985461 we have written to the government to give us legal empowerment and that under this act commodity brokers should also be included
2985462 theres no cancellations out of the canadian side or the european side but the american cancellations are killing everybody
2985463 theres more competition in a time of the year thats important to canadian tourism
2985464 traditionally the dollar was 65 cents and fuel costs were low and so it was easy and we got spoiled for sure
2985465 ten years ago there were 40 to 60 nations really promoting their countries for tourism in an aggressive way and now weve got 100 countries promoting themselves and they also look to the u s as a very affluent economy

2985527 in einer zeit wo viele unternehmen ber einen mangel an fachkr ften klagen kann ich nur daran appellieren auch lteren arbeitnehmerinnen und arbeitnehmern eine chance zu geben die integrationserfolge zeigen dass die wertvollen erfahrungen lterer arbeitnehmer von den unternehmen wieder st rker wahrgenommen anerkannt und gesch tzt werden das gilt es fortzusetzen

2985536 the world has lost a true creative genius and a passionate humanitarian but his indelible legacy will remain ever present
2985537 our deepest sympathies go out to his family friends and all who were inspired by the man and his music
2985538 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
2985539 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
2985540 around the world the consumption of entertainment products is growing rapidly
2985541 the question is how do you offer it and how do you get paid for it

2985553 we spent all night yesterday in discussions and some of the things that were holding back at times i nearly raised my fist but he remained cool
2985554 i cant imagine not using any technology in the classroom
2985555 if my smart board projector or any of that stuff ever died i dont know what i would do
2985556 looking at content and using it to help teach a unit is one thing
2985557 but creating content is wonderful also because you can easily take an audio recording of your lecture or you can turn a powerpoint into a podcast
2985558 last year the things that i struggled with and i feel im pretty tech savvy they knew what they were doing
2985559 lets say youve got a math problem you didnt get it and its 10 p m
2985560 you could see a podcast of that actual formula being worked out by your teacher if they took that extra step and created that content for you
2985561 one of the things when we were searching on itunes was a grammar girls podcast
2985562 one of the things ive always struggled to get the kids interested in is grammar stuff so involving podcasts will hook them there
2985563 i appreciate the public demand to watch concerts in the big theater we plan to complete its restoration within two or three months but to do so we need cooperation between austrian and turkish authorities restoration of the ancient open air theater in ephesus is a genuinely big task both for archeologists and the restoration experts we need to strengthen the theater so that we do not have any problems in holding music concerts there i know that not only turks but also foreign tourists who visit ephesus want concerts to be held in ephesus i hope this will happen as soon as possible
2985564 we now have so many new facts related to the ephesus of prehistoric times thanks to relics we have uncovered in ukuri ih y k
2985565 archeologists need time excavating alone is the easiest part of their job but restoration of unearthed remnants takes quite a lot time the culture and tourism ministry wants to have the uncovered remnants restored in a professional way
2985566 if restoration of them cannot be fully achieved then theyd better remain under the soil
2985567 why cant you read pride and prejudice in the kitchen
2985568 jesus is instructed to watch israels house and not leave the place while the master goes away on a tour to collect clothes to be dyed but no sooner has israel left the house than jesus runs out with the boys terian says
2985569 the most amazing part of the story of the nine year old jesus playing a form of cricket with the boys at the sea shore is that he would go on playing the game on water over the sea waves
2985570 he jesus would take the boys to the seashore and carrying the playing ball and the club he would go over the waves of the sea as though he was playing on a frozen surface hitting the playing ball
2985571 but the apocryphal story shows that for a ball game even jesus would forget work and would go to have fun with the boys he says
2985572 certainly in the u k and europe as far as we know
2985573 my hunch is that it was some usable part of the domestic riches that went into the grave with this chap
2985574 one of the tempting and really exciting prospects is that the find might fulfill the theory that the sons of nobility may have been sent to rome or sent abroad to undertake military training or to complete their education
2985575 it was all part of the empire building process of that time to secure loyal high status client kings in the countries that were to become part of the roman empire
2985576 astonishing finds of metalwork demonstrating a close link between britain and the roman world in the years before the conquest
2985577 hopefully in six months well have a lot more information
2985578 we undertook this because of our interest in the history of restoration
2985579 this piece has been apart and put back together several times
2985580 how comfortable are we after all these restorations to show a statue without a head
2985581 i am convinced we are dealing with a statue of dionysus
2985582 we imagined it to be more ugly from the photographs and fragments
2985583 what struck me most over the past two days was the quality of the sculpture its so much more than just fragments
2985584 will be to infill some of the fractures so as to make them less disturbing
2985585 frequently statues are carved from a single block of marble
2985586 when you consider the grave misfortunes that have become some of our sculptures
2985587 the general consensus is that the statue is more likely dionysus rather than antinuous
2985588 we look at each piece and try to balance points of view
2985589 if someone disagrees with us in the future which they no doubt will they can add or take away from what weve done

2985641 the reason lado did this is because he knew the enormous pr value that georgia would gain by going to the money people and analysts particularly since georgia is clearly the aggressor this time
2985642 lado is a former banker himself so he knew that by framing the conflict for the most influential bankers and analysts in new york that these power bankers would then write up reports and go on cnbc and argue lado gurgenidzes talking points it was brilliant and now youre starting to see the american media shift its coverage from calling it georgia invading ossetian territory to the new spin that its russian imperial aggression against tiny little georgia
2985643 when violence broke out in the caucasus on friday morning john mccain quickly issued a statement that was far more strident toward the russians than that of president bush barack obama and much of the west but as russian warplanes pounded georgian targets far beyond south ossetia this weekend bush obama and others have moved closer to mccains initial position
2985644 obama accused russia of escalating the crisis through its clear and continued violation of georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2985645 this is not pipeline war but an assault on russian influence
2985646 that russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community

2985680 how can i help thats all we were thinking we talked about how the best thing we could do was try to play volleyball
2985681 it meant a tremendous amount to myself and the guys when we heard from him
2985682 he talked about trying to move on he just told us it will be difficult but together well be much stronger

2985686 the thing that came across as hugh was talking to us is you know what ive got this happening right now but we came here with a goal in mind and weve invested all this time in it and we need to go out there and try to complete what we started
2985687 it means going out there and playing better every match than we did the previous match
2985688 we really felt the loss as one of our own
2985689 maybe thats why it hurt so much it just felt so close
2985690 the best way we can honor them at this juncture is to go out and compete every day and play hard every day and enjoy and love the game of volleyball and it is a game
2985691 we should be playing it and enjoying it and loving it as they would
2985692 were totally aware that we may see him and we may not
2985693 thats completely all right with us he has other priorities
2985694 id much rather be sitting on the bench telling him what i think he should be doing rather than where i am now

2985712 there will of course be a universal language which will be either esperanto or pidgin english the literature of the past will for the most part not be translated into this language since its outlook and emotional background will be considered unsettling serious students of history will be able to obtain a permit from the government to study such works as hamlet and othello but the general public will be forbidden access to them on the ground that they glorify private murder boys will not be allowed to read books about pirates or red indians love themes will be discouraged on the ground that love being anarchic is silly if not wicked all this will make life very pleasant for the virtuous
2985713 the nineteenth century suffered from a curious division between its political ideas and its economic practice in politics it carried out the liberal ideas of locke and rousseau which were adapted to a society of small peasant proprietors its watchwords were liberty and equality but meantime it was inventing the technique which is leading the twentieth century to destroy liberty and to replace equality by new forms of oligarchy the prevalence of liberal thought has been in some ways a misfortune since it has prevented men of large vision from thinking out in an impersonal manner the problems raised by industrialism socialism and communism it is true are essentially industrial creeds but their outlook is so much dominated by the class war that they have little leisure to give to anything but the means of achieving political victory traditional morality gives very little help in the modern world a rich man may plunge millions into destitution by some act which not even the severest catholic confessor would consider sinful while he will need absolution for a trivial sexual aberration which at the worst has wasted an hour that might have been more usefully employed there is need of a new doctrine on the subject of my duty to my neighbour it is not only traditional religious teaching that fails to give adequate guidance on this subject but also the teaching of nineteenth century liberalism take for example such a book as mill on liberty mill maintains that while the state has a right to interfere with those of my actions that have serious consequences to others it should leave me free where the effects of my actions are mainly confined to myself such a principle however in the modern world leaves hardly any scope for individual freedom as society becomes more organic the effects of men upon each other become more and more numerous and important so that there remains hardly anything in regard to which mills defence of liberty is applicable take for example freedom of speech and of the press it is clear that a society that permits these is thereby precluded from various achievements which are possible to a society that forbids them in time of war this is obvious to everybody because in war time the national purpose is simple and the causation involved is obvious hitherto it has not been customary for a nation in peace time to have any national purpose except the preservation of its territory and its constitution a government which like that of soviet russia has a purpose in peace time as ardent and definite as that of other nations in war time is compelled to curtail freedom of speech and of the press as much while it is at peace as other nations do when they are at war the diminution of individual liberty which has been taking place during the last twenty years is likely to continue since it has two continuing causes on the one hand modern technique makes society more organic on the other hand modern sociology makes men more and more aware of the causal laws in virtue of which one mans acts are useful or harmful to another man if we are to justify any particular form of individual liberty in the scientific society of the future we shall have to do it on the ground that that form of liberty is for the good of society as a whole but not in most cases on the ground that the acts concerned affect nobody but the agent
2985714 the man who dreams of a scientifically organized world and wishes to translate his dream into practice finds himself faced with many obstacles there is the opposition of inertia and habit people wish to continue behaving as they always have behaved and living as they always have lived there is the opposition of vested interest an economic system inherited from feudal times gives advantages to men who have done nothing to deserve them and these men being rich and powerful are able to place formidable obstacles in the way of fundamental change in addition to these forces there are also hostile idealisms christian ethics is in certain fundamental respects opposed to the scientific ethic which is gradually growing up christianity emphasizes the importance of the individual soul and is not prepared to sanction the sacrifice of an innocent man for the sake of some ulterior good to the majority christianity in a word is unpolitical as is natural since it grew up among men devoid of political power the new ethic which is gradually growing in connexion with scientific technique will have its eye upon society rather than upon the individual it will have little use for the superstition of guilt and punishment but will be prepared to make individuals suffer for the public good without inventing reasons purporting to show that they deserve to suffer in this sense it will be ruthless and according to traditional ideas immoral but the change will have come about naturally through the habit of viewing society as a whole rather than as a collection of individuals we view a human body as a whole and if for example it is necessary to amputate a limb we do not consider it necessary to prove first that the limb is wicked we consider the good of the whole body a quite sufficient argument similarly the man who thinks of society as a whole will sacrifice a member of society for the good of the whole without much consideration for that individuals welfare this has always been the practice in war because war is a collective enterprise soldiers are exposed to the risk of death for the public good although no one suggests that they deserve death but men have not hitherto attached the same importance to social purposes other than war and have therefore shrunk from inflicting sacrifices which were felt to be unjust i think it probable that the scientific idealists of the future will be free from this scruple not only in time of war but in time of peace also in overcoming the difficulties of the opposition that they will encounter they will find themselves organized into an oligarchy of opinion such as is formed by the communist party in the u s s r
2985715 in suggesting any curtailment of liberty there are always two quite distinct questions to be considered the first is whether such a curtailment would be in the public interest if it were wisely carried out and the second is whether it will be in the public interest when it is carried out with a certain measure of ignorance and perversity these two questions are in theory quite distinct but from the point of view of the government the second question does not exist since every government believes itself entirely free from both ignorance and perversity every government consequently in so far as it is not restrained by traditional prejudices will advocate more interference with liberty than is wise when therefore as in this chapter we are considering what interferences with liberty might be theoretically justified we must hesitate to draw the conclusion that they should be advocated in practice i think it probable however that almost all interferences with liberty for which there is a theoretical justification will in time be carried out in practice because scientific technique is gradually making governments so strong that they need not consider outside opinion the result of this will be that governments will be able to interfere with individual liberty wherever in their opinion there is a sound reason for so doing and for the reason just given this will be much more often than it should be for this reason scientific technique is likely to lead to a governmental tyranny which may in time prove disastrous
2985716 let us take some examples of traditional principles which appear no longer defensible to take a more important illustration consider the immense sums of money that are spent on advertising it cannot possibly be maintained that these bring any but the most meagre return to the community the principle of permitting each capitalist to invest his money as he chooses is not therefore socially defensible
2985717 take again the question of work both the kind of work and the method of performing it at present young people choose their own trade or profession usually because at the moment of their choice it seems to afford a good opening a well informed person possessed of foresight might know that the particular line in question was going to be much less profitable a few years hence in such a case some public guidance to the young might prove extremely useful and as regards technical methods it is seldom in the public interest that an antiquated or wasteful technique should be allowed to persist when a more economical technique is known at present owning to the irrational character of the capitalist system the interest of the individual wage earner is very often opposed to the interest of the community since economical methods may cause him to lose his job this is due to the survival of capitalistic principles in a society which has grown so organic that it ought not to tolerate them it is obvious that in a well organized community it should be impossible for a large body of individuals to profit by preserving an inefficient technique it is clear that the use of the most efficient technique should be enforced and no wage earner should be allowed to suffer by its enforcement
2985718 i come now to a matter which touches the individual more intimately i mean the question of propagation it has hitherto been considered that any man and woman not within the prohibited degrees have a right to marry and having married have a right if not a duty to have as many children as nature may decree this is a right which the scientific society of the future is not likely to tolerate in any given state of industrial and agricultural technique there is an optimum density of population which ensures a greater degree of material well being than would result from either an increase or a diminution of numbers as a general rule except in new countries the density of population has been beyond this optimum though perhaps france in recent decades has been an exception except where there is property to be inherited the member of a small family suffers almost as much from over population as the member of a large family those who cause over population are therefore doing an injury not only to their own children but to the community it may therefore be assumed that society will discourage them if necessary as soon as religious prejudices no longer stand in the way of such action the same question will arise in a more dangerous form as between different nations and different races if a nation finds that it is losing military superiority through a lower birth rate than that of a rival it may attempt as has already been done in such cases to stimulate its own birth rate but when this proves ineffective as it probably will there will be a tendency to demand a limitation in the birth rate of the rival nation an international government if it ever comes into being will have to take account of such matters and just as there is at present a quota of national immigrants into the united states so in future there will be a quota of national immigrants into the world children in excess of the licensed figure will presumably be subjected to infanticide this would be less cruel than the present method which is to kill them by war or starvation i am however only prophesying a certain future not advocating it quality as well as quantity of population is likely to become a matter for public regulation already in many states of america it is permissible to sterilized the mentally defective and a similar proposal in england is in the domain of practical politics this is only the first step as time goes on we may expect a greater and greater percentage of the population to be regarded as mentally defective from the point of view of parenthood however that may be it is clear that the parents who have a child when there is every likelihood of its being mentally defective are doing a wrong both to the child and to the community no defensible principle of liberty therefore stands in the way of preventing them from such behaviour
2985719 equality like liberty is difficult to reconcile with scientific technique since this involves a great apparatus of experts and officials inspiring and controlling vast organizations democratic forms may be preserved in politics but they will not have as much reality as in a community of small peasant proprietors officials unavoidably have power and where many vital questions are so technical that the ordinary man cannot hope to understand them experts must inevitably acquire a considerable measure of control take the question of currency and credit as an example william jennings bryan it is true made currency an electoral issue in 1896 but the men who voted for him were men who would have voted for him whatever issue he had selected at the present time calculable misery is being caused by a wrong handling of the question of currency and credit but it is impossible to submit this question to the electorate except in some passionate and unscientific form the only way in which anything can be done is to convince the officials who control the great central banks so long as these men act honestly and in accordance with tradition the community cannot control them since if they are mistaken very few people will know it to take a less important illustration everyone who has ever compared british and american methods of handling goods traffic on railways knows that the american methods are infinitely superior there are no private trucks and the trucks of the railways are of standard size capable of carrying forty tons in england everything is higgledy piggledy and unsystematic and the use of private trucks causes great waste if this were put right freights could be reduced and consumers would benefit since there would be no obvious gain either to railway companies or to railway workers if a more uniform system is ever imposed it will be done not as a result of a democratic demand but by government officials the scientific society will be just as oligarchic under socialism or communism as under capitalism for even where the forms of democracy exist they cannot supply the ordinary voter with the requisite knowledge nor enable him to be on the spot at the crucial moment the men who understand the complicated mechanism of a modern community and who have the habit of initiative and decision must inevitably control the course of events to a very great extent perhaps this is even more true in a socialistic state than in any other for in a socialistic state economic and political power are concentrated in the same hands and the national organization of the economic life is more complete than in a state where private enterprise exists moreover a socialistic state is likely to have more perfect control than any other over the organs of publicity and propaganda so that it will have more power of causing men to know what it wishes known and not to know what it wishes unknown equality therefore like liberty is i fear no more than a nineteenth century dream the world of the future will contain a governing class probably not hereditary but more analogous to the government of the catholic church and this governing class as they acquire increasing knowledge and confidence will interfere more and more with the life of the individual and will learn more and more the technique of causing this interference to be tolerated it may be assumed that their purposes will be excellent and their conduct honourable it may be assumed that they will be well informed and industrious but it cannot i think be assumed that they will abstain from the exercise of power merely on the ground that individual initiative is a good thing or on the ground that an oligarchy is unlikely to consider the true interests of its slaves for men capable of such self restraint will not rise to positions of power which except when they are hereditary are attained only by those who are energetic and untroubled by doubt

2985748 interventions into the architectural environment of old petersburg should be very delicate but that is a problem for the architectural community after all it isnt the governor or the city government that approves projects
2985749 projects are approved by the city planning council the citys leading architects have seats on the council in the past few years several city planning mistakes have been made weve recognized them fortunately there havent been so many we recognized them publicly theyre on the conscience of the architects who designed these buildings and on the conscience of the people who made these decisions

2985764 u s inventories are indicating that the market is a little bit tighter than people think and that it isnt a one way bet
2985765 the forward curve is quite a good barometer of fundamentals in the market obviously barring these geopolitical events
2985766 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
2985767 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient

2985769 there are those who would suggest that we would be better served by simply rejecting this agreement that all we have to do is simply go back and get more
2985770 or they argue the agreement favors the northwest pilots over the delta pilots in one respect or another but upon closer analysis these views are many times based on a misunderstanding of the agreement a misinterpretation of its terms a failure to acknowledge todays economic realities or simply anger
2985771 as i have written many times before anger is not a strategy
2985772 the proposal also provides the certainty of an all cash transaction that is within the range of value determined by republics own financial advisor for its pending transaction with allied waste industries
2985773 our 37 all cash proposal clearly offers republic stockholders a better and more certain value alternative than is contemplated in the republic allied transaction
2985774 we believe our proposal is clearly superior for republics stockholders and is designed so we can work cooperatively with republic to structure a transaction that would benefit both republic and waste management stockholders
2985775 today 4 different people told me they want to start a site like this and want my advice as to how to start a site like this and my advice is dont start a site like this the reason is not because i dont want more competition because i really dont care about competition because being competitive is too jock for me and jocks fuck each other up the ass in the locker room the reason is because everyone thinks they have the capacity to run one of these pieces of shits and thinks that their opinion is better than mine or the next guys and that they could pump this shit out in about an hour a day and make the same as working a 9 5 job but they dont realize that they are about 3 years too late and 1000 sites are doing the exact same fucking thing as they want to do and post pretty much the same fuckin content as they want to and say the same thing you have to say

2985836 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2985837 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2985838 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2985839 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2985840 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2985841 universities are breaking new ground by using video over wi fi in a number innovative ways
2985842 this is driving the adoption of high speed 802 11n students in the near future at least the diligent ones will be just as likely to watch their favorite professors lectures on their laptops as they will be to view americas next top model
2985843 see it isnt that we underestimated the amount of infastructure we needed its because a manager didnt do his job very well
2985844 we had a great start but we were hit after the first corner which dropped us down a few places then of course the yellows came out and i think that helped us a bit for the restarts and we gained a couple positions on each one
2985845 of course at the end there it was a very hard battle with jonathan we were only closing very slightly and when i got very close id lose all my downforce i made a little mistake and i think jonathan made a little mistake at the very end and i think both of us did a very good job we were pulling away from the rest of the field i was quite happy to finish up there on the top spot
2985846 germany is maybe the most difficult asphalt rally of them all and we come to it having not competed on this surface for seven months since the monte
2985847 it is also the first time in germany for the sx4 wrc so we will use the rally to fine tune the set up of the car to its very specific demands
2985848 there is a lot to learn but historically this is a rally where it is possible to do well by staying out of trouble my advice to the drivers is to avoid any unnecessary risks in the meantime we will continue our work in trying to improve the performance and the reliability of the sx4 wrc

2985851 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2985852 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2985853 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2985855 we cant say whether or not the shark took a swimming young bear
2985856 we dont know how active these sharks are as predators
2985857 theres no possibility a greenland shark could predate a live adult white bear unless it was injured or seriously ill
2985858 greenland sharks do seem quite sluggish but they have been known to move very quickly when they are eating
2985859 both walruses and polar bears are powerful in the water both could handle most potential predators but not killer whales
2985860 the greenland shark simply cannot afford the risk of injury nor the expenditure of energy required to kill such a large and dangerous animal with or without the help of global warming
2985861 michelle bruce was undoubtedly the most beautiful woman i had ever seen in the flesh

2985903 well we always have a lot of options now that we control green light and our destiny with these films obviously we cant respond to hypotheticals and what we would do with various either competitive moves or partner moves like sony with spider man so at this point id just have to say once a move like that happens well obviously let our response be made publicly but it wouldnt be constructive to respond to a hypothetical

2985938 although i could not share the joy of holding the games with chinese i think china will bring brand new olympics with this fantastic ceremony
2985939 i will watch the beijing games from tonight since holding olympics in the most populous fastest growing and vigorous country will be a significant event for the human beings
2985940 the gathering of international athletes also proves that china is a friend of the world it is one world now
2985941 it has shown a great artistry of the director zhang yimou and changed my past view on china
2985942 i was deeply moved by the performing kids in the ceremony because they are so lovely
2985943 when japanese athletes pacing into the stadium i can hear from the tv chinese cheering and feel that it has come from inside of their hearts
2985944 although i cant sit in the birds nest to watch it i almost cried when the song chanting our motherland finished by the red little girl

2985960 and the lord god said behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live for ever
2985961 and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul

2985963 jesus said unto them if ye were blind ye should have no sin but now ye say we see therefore your sin remaineth
2985964 wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned
2985965 forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil
2985966 and the devil taking him up into an high mountain shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time and the devil said unto him all this power will i give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoever i will i give it if thou therefore wilt worship me all shall be thine
2985967 and from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force
2985968 jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that i should not be delivered to the jews but now is my kingdom not from hence
2985969 and jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth
2985970 at that time they shall call jerusalem the throne of the lord and all the nations shall be gathered unto it to the name of the lord to jerusalem neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart

2985984 psa has argued that the current status for combination ibuprofen codeine products is appropriate as it maintains access for consumers to these useful medicines
2985985 it is clear that the ndpsc has given thorough consideration to the issues involved and they should be commended for their efforts
2985986 psa will be considering the foreshadowed proposals in relation to pack sizes and providing input into the consultation process
2985987 we have argued that decisions such as this should weigh up the benefits for the majority of the community who use these medicines appropriately compared to the risks of misuse
2985988 based on feedback from its members psa is aware that in some jurisdictions pockets of possible misuse of codeine ibuprofen combination products have been observed
2985989 however we believe the level of possible misuse is not regarded as widespread and in most instances pharmacists have been involved in providing appropriate interventions
2985990 although some cases of misuse of a particular combination product with serious health outcomes have been published the numbers are small and the incidents have been reported to be unusual
2985991 psa is not aware of any published evidence of widespread misuse apart from newspaper articles based on anecdotal reports
2985992 psa believes the decision reinforces pharmacists role in promoting the appropriate use of medicines
2985993 community pharmacy has procedures in place to minimise misuse of these and other products and pharmacists will continue to play their part in providing guidance on appropriate use
2985994 psa has been canvassing opportunities for providing education and up to date information to pharmacists and other pharmacy staff about possible misuse of products containing codeine
2985995 psa would welcome working in partnership with relevant sponsors and government to help pharmacists deliver targeted quality use of medicines messages to the public

2986061 flash is seeing a pretty aggressive growth cycle now but i still think javascript is going to be used in 10 times the number of flash apps that launch
2986062 its amazing what people have done with html which was never intended to do rich internet applications and flash was originally created for lightweight animation literally for mickey mouse on the web
2986063 but these technologies were designed for something else and people are really hacking them to do more
2986064 if you put it all together that lends itself to ajax being a very powerful capable rich internet application technology
2986065 if you look at google apps theyre doing great things but how many shops out there have the ajax chops that google does

2986106 yo creo que el pa s no ha ganado nada al haber sido ratificados el presidente vicepresidente y prefectos creo que los prefectos de la media luna no debieron aceptar este refer ndum revocatorio por la falta de transparencia ahora frente a la crisis del pa s creo que el gobierno que no tiene vocaci n de di logo debe hacerlo y buscar una salida a los conflictos

2986110 to a very large extent it is in their interest to try to reach a negotiated settlement that is a doable deal
2986111 trying to exhaust every avenue they can to avoid the kind of financial outlay we are talking about here
2986112 i would expect that the damage model that we create showing what is actually happened in the watershed will be beyond the reach of the companies
2986113 its going to be far more significant than the resources that are available even though its a multi billion dollar industry
2986114 does not deter us from the overriding objective of having a business operate in an environmentally sound manner
2986115 its only when they have exhausted what they reasonably think are methods of avoiding a day of reckoning that they will get realistic about resolving the issue
2986116 were gearing for trial at the same time were always willing to talk

2986143 ever since the official signing of the flat earth societys charter one of our most difficult goals was to understand the mindset of those we were trying to save the complexities of efimovichs theory that theorys convoluted nature and dependence on flawed logic and the omission of obstructions make it nearly impossible to understand at all let alone understand why anyone would believe such dribble

2986149 last year we built 14 two bedroom bungalows across three separate sites specifically for this age group and it is fair to say that our waiting list was inundated with people looking for this type of accommodation
2986150 there is clearly a huge need for modern well built accommodation for the over 55s and we already have a considerable waiting list for this next phase which will be completed in the autumn of 09
2986151 the exceptionally high demand for these bungalows demonstrates a clear need for this type of housing and peak valley is in early discussions with the council about ways to increase the provision of elderly persons housing in hattersley in the future

2986205 the united states has long expressed concerns about government financial support for the launch of commercial aircraft and has pursued this issue with the europeans in the wto washington will take a very careful look at the support announced by canada quebec and the uk to ensure they do not distort the market for commercial airliners or contravene wto rules
2986206 the us government is making inquiries about the nature and terms of the money being provided to bombardier if as seems likely it is deemed launch aid the us could take the matter to the wto

2986211 the key is convincing villages that stopping circumcision is an egyptian idea not one imported by international aid groups or western governments fouad said the group also promotes homegrown activities such as community plays discussions with local doctors and religious debates along with local groups taking action egypts government has also been discouraging the practice in recent years but activists stress that laws alone arent enough many women fear potential husbands will reject daughters as impure or immoral medical rumors including that circumcision is the only way to control a girls sexual desires are rampant others believe that abandoning the practice is caving to western pressures to change their society

2986214 not as a quaint custom but as child cruelty as child abuse because thats what it is
2986215 even if it may be committed without child abuse or cruelty in mind thats what it is i think that if we can persuade the home office to do more when the police are doing so much i see that at last there has been a breakthrough and things are going to change i hope so

2986217 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2986218 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2986219 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2986220 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2986221 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2986222 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2986223 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2986224 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2986225 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2986226 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2986227 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2986228 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2986229 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2986230 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2986231 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2986232 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2986233 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2986234 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2986235 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2986236 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2986237 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2986238 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2986239 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2986240 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2986241 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2986242 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2986243 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2986244 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2986245 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2986246 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2986247 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2986248 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2986249 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2986250 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2986251 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2986252 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2986253 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2986254 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2986255 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2986256 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2986257 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2986258 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2986259 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2986260 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2986261 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2986262 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2986263 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2986264 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2986265 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2986266 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2986267 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2986268 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2986269 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2986270 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2986271 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2986272 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2986273 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2986274 the demand is so strong it may impact or delay the new countries coming on
2986275 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2986276 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2986277 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2986278 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2986279 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2986280 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2986281 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2986282 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2986283 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2986284 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2986285 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2986286 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2986287 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2986288 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2986289 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2986290 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2986291 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2986292 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2986293 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2986294 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2986295 who are open to doing something on the production side
2986296 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2986297 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2986298 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2986299 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2986300 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2986301 google is and will be and always has been vulnerable
2986302 they havent been open with consumers ultimately this all comes down the the fact that they just want to track you guys
2986303 spread across virtually all states guam puerto rico and the usvi
2986304 the court sees this as an attempt to get political mileage for unp leader ranil wickramasinghe and to discredit mahinda rajapaksa
2986305 coalition troops called in close air support to engage the militants hiding in the structure they did not have knowledge of non combatants in the buildings at that time
2986306 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
2986307 the only result of the use of airstrikes is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism
2986308 my wife and i have come to reside in england
2986309 he is certainly going to use his foreign base to influence thailands domestic politics
2986310 there may be a serious conflict in the long run that results in extreme violence if some decide they cannot rely on the judiciary for justice
2986311 still has influence over this government and is pulling the strings
2986312 i thought i would be able to prove my innocence and receive justice which is why i returned to thailand on feb 28 but the situation has deteriorated
2986313 i have also constantly received news that my life is not safe wherever i travel i have to use bulletproof cars this is the result i got from having volunteered to serve the country the king and the people
2986314 i had a guy shoot a gun next to me thats how bad it was the guy shot two shots i ran home it was terrifying this was bad i never thought i would see this in my life
2986315 usually its quiet though theres never nothing bad this is bad
2986316 i thought i would see this only on tv never in real life
2986317 a little further down the road there were two fires and the kids were massacring our town

2986366 the results of the survey so far show that although most companies understand the importance of having business continuity and disaster recovery plans in place there seems to be a knowledge gap when it comes to understanding the technologies that are currently available to deliver reliable and fast recovery in the event of a system failure these days it is not enough to blindly trust that backups are being completed properly businesses and the regulatory environment in which we all exist demand fast and reliable recovery time objectives for it systems such is the pace at which a modern company transacts business these days that those who are without their it for any great length of time are losing serious money customers are also becoming a lot more aware of the information that companies hold and are getting less and less forgiving about delivery disruption let alone the thought of their sensitive data being transported in a an unencrypted and readable format

2986368 only recently have people started to carry around so much personal information and entertainment content with them mobiles have become a digital treasure trove and we need to be made aware of their true value its not just about the glossy handset

2986370 if you lose your data then often the loss for the individual is much more than the value of the handset itself in most cases the information lost on a mobile is hardly ever retrieved if a handset is stolen the data loss has proven to be the biggest inconvenience and trauma during a theft as you never know who has your details this takes us into the realm of id theft and fraud
2986371 with advanced advertising cable operators can provide a unique value proposition to advertisers who want to target the subscribers who best fit their product or service this is accomplished by unlocking the many sources of audience qualification information that exist or are emerging across cable operators systems and subscriber bases as well the ability cable operators have to identify specific viewing preferences and habits and to track viewing behaviour on a granular basis is critical to the success of advanced advertising

2986376 whether this is down to better parental control the effect of media scare stories or just a growing understanding of the risks of social networking they are now actively managing their digital fingerprints or is the social networking explosion starting to wane
2986377 just as uk plc is bracing itself for the financial impact of post graduates that expect the latest and greatest gadgets and mobile access technologies so should universities
2986378 universities that want to lure the best students will need to invest heavily to implement an it infrastructure that will meet the expectations of this group and maintain their competitive edge in the race for securing higher student intake to meet this 150m price tag it is inevitable that universities will be looking to the government uk plc and possibly students to put their hands in their pockets
2986379 this survey is deliberately targeted at an age group that is being asked to choose its education and career path whilst this science statistic should worry uk plc and the governments of today and tomorrow the message is clear if we can educate them on the correlation between science and the gadgets they cant live without and spark their interest before choosing their gcse options we can influence the future of british industry
2986380 educators and private industry need to collaborate closely on how sciences are taught businesses worldwide are increasingly dependent upon technology to create new markets and achieve better margins technology is a lucrative thriving career option that seeks to drive down operational costs and increase innovation in a climate whereby the future careers of the realtime generation could be impacted by the credit crunch this is an opportune moment for the science and technology industry to reach out to this digital native workforce

2986382 realising that i had to set up an it system that was both scalable and robust enough to cope with massive data needs with a limited budget gave me a big headache
2986383 a supplier needed to convince me that they could deliver what they promised i knew intercept were on my wavelength when they explained how the system was setup when it could be delivered and the simple cost per user per month pricing model i liked the aggressive approach to getting things done thats something i can relate to
2986384 we have been using onlinedesktop for some time now and its as reliable as our electricity supply it is always there and its always on we just take it for granted
2986385 i need things done correctly the first time and i want them done with minimal fuss and to high standards of excellence my customers are like that too they do not want to hang around and also want their needs to be fulfilled pretty quickly thats why i think i found a real winner with intercept i can work with them knowing that winning is their passion too
2986386 the motto of this institute is to fight a guerrilla like a guerrilla
2986387 we have trained soldiers from the us sri lanka uzbekistan nepal malaysia indonesia and other countries while we are expecting soldiers from china and other parts of the world soon
2986388 the troops are taught to live in difficult and hostile terrains eat and sleep like guerrillas and strike as silently as a guerrilla
2986389 the training we are currently being imparted here would go a long way in tackling terror we have also shared our experiences with our indian counterparts the entire exercise is simply great
2986390 the training module is non conventional and once a soldier undergoes training here he can face deadly situations anywhere in the world

2986490 one of the biggest frustrations is what arrogance these people think we are stupid
2986491 we are in the business of gymnastics and we know what a kid of 14 or 15 or 16 looks like you dont have to be a gymnastics coach to know what they look like at 16
2986492 they are 12 14 years old max and they line them up for the world and having the government back them
2986493 since they forced an age limit it has gotten worse and worse the fig is running away from the age problem they set an age limit and now they cant control it
2986494 the only situation is to lift up the age limit it would be an even playing field for everyone

2986688 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2986689 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2986690 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2986691 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2986692 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2986693 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas

2986703 ive been here five weeks now im very cold and very wet but im staying here
2986704 im getting a lot of response from foreign tourists they agree with me and say its too expensive
2986705 the thing that really annoys me is that not only have they spent so much money on public inquiries and doing nothing with it but it is a sacred site its not a cash cow

2986709 these studies provide new ideas to help the constellation program develop innovative reliable requirements for the systems that will be used when outposts are established on the moon
2986710 nasa will also use our study to form the foundation of the infrastructure and support systems that are needed on the moon
2986711 it is important to our overall business strategy to bring innovative ideas and expertise to nasa to help define the future requirements for lunar systems
2986712 although small in dollar value these study contracts allow boeings advanced systems division to bring the best and brightest ideas from across the company to nasa
2986713 we have put together a team across the space station suppliers entrepreneurs and academia to provide an innovative approach to define a minimum functionality habitat we are not just bringing the same old set of human space solutions but are looking forward
2986714 i have traveled the universe in science fiction since i was a kid but this time we get to do it for real we need to be living on the moon and the planets who knows what we can do when we go back to the moon and maybe we can make it available for the masses instead of only a few

2986721 1 an analysis of the extent to which grantmaking by large california foundations serves populations of color and 2 a survey of california foundations to collect baseline data on the demographic composition of their boards and staff and on the types of diversity related data collection and grantmaking they are involved in
2986722 per se paint only a partial picture of the scope of foundation grantmaking that benefits populations of color
2986723 lower boundary estimate of how much such grantmaking is taking place
2986724 a first attempt to develop a comprehensive estimate of the extent to which populations of color are being served by foundation grantmaking
2986725 the appointment of one brilliant man will not save the region
2986726 i cant imagine not using any technology in the classroom
2986727 if my smart board projector or any of that stuff ever died i dont know what i would do
2986728 looking at content and using it to help teach a unit is one thing
2986729 but creating content is wonderful also because you can easily take an audio recording of your lecture or you can turn a powerpoint into a podcast
2986730 last year the things that i struggled with and i feel im pretty tech savvy they knew what they were doing
2986731 lets say youve got a math problem you didnt get it and its 10 p m
2986732 you could see a podcast of that actual formula being worked out by your teacher if they took that extra step and created that content for you
2986733 one of the things when we were searching on itunes was a grammar girls podcast
2986734 one of the things ive always struggled to get the kids interested in is grammar stuff so involving podcasts will hook them there
2986735 it is too early to estimate how much oil has been discovered in this well bore but we do believe that as a consequence of this discovery there is a relatively high probability that this area could contain enough oil and gas to double revus current reserves and contingent resources
2986736 our client roster inspired us to launch this analysis series due to our customers
2986737 it is very exciting for us to be able to observe first hand such trends as the bucking of the biggest losing streak in the paid search market
2986738 we have to look in the coming days how pieters will recover and if he will be able to do his coaching job
2986739 it really meant something to me because hes a huge superstar
2986740 i was in a little bit of a panic because you know the injury you know it really hurt
2986741 but when i was on the ground it kind of eased out a little bit it could have been adrenaline or whatever
2986742 100 percent coming to the olympics than risking being 85 percent just to go to a meet to see where im at
2986743 when im in the blocks if im not shaking im really thinking about trying to react
2986744 i said i need to go get by kobe so i can get on tv
2986745 we have to look in the coming days how pieters will recover and if he will be able to do his coaching job
2986746 when bolt ran 9 72 i realized that i had to run a 9 6 to beat him and thats what i trained my mind to do
2986747 the record can go and the guys can go 9 6 i did it with a lot of wind but i feel i can go there without wind
2986748 this is one of the hottest 100s in history there hasnt been as much hype about it for a long time
2986749 i dont feel any aches or twitches ive been staying hydrated and im confident my body will hold up
2986750 i was really upset the same thing happened in 2004 and that memory rose up and started messing with me
2986751 athletes have a tendency to think they can do anything now i definitely know i have to look after my body a bit better
2986752 i guess it should be the world record holder but powell is very confident right now
2986753 there is pressure on bolt and i dont know how hes taking it hes a young guy and he likes to have fun regardless of what he says people are expecting him to win the gold medal im in the back but ive had some good practices
2986754 to have three guys who have run 9 7 i think its amazing and i cant overlook americans walter dix and darvis patton or any of the others
2986755 i think the torch was lit at 12 01 so it was actually on my birthday
2986756 the ceremony was the best experience of my life words cant even describe it
2986757 why the great concern why stand on guard what are we defending canada against where is the threat coming from who or what is our enemy
2986758 a baby is not a person until it is outside the womb
2986759 the words by way of correction in s 43 meant that the use of force had to be sober and reasoned address actual behaviour and be intended to restrain control or express symbolic disapproval
2986760 raising a good child is a blessing but having a spank or tap on the hand for reaching towards a flame puts me in jail
2986761 debate on abortion is not a conscience pricking thing its a dead horse stop trying to beat it it took far too long to legalize it in the first place no need to try and send us back 30 years we as a society are trying to progress and it seems all religion has to offer is regression
2986762 the right to life constitutes the supreme value of the constitution because all other rights are derived from it
2986763 the duty of the citizen becomes a crime if it makes him forget the duty of the man
2986764 where are they taking us is that where we want to go
2986765 i believe it will be a very tough competition were up for it
2986766 china and the u s are the class of the world
2986767 they are the top two and theyre sure to fight it out for most of the gold medals
2986768 we got all of our jitters out of the way which we needed to do
2986769 it gives us something that will motivate us and push to be even stronger for the next competition
2986770 they give stable performances they are very likely to get the gold medal
2986771 especially for the young team members theres no 100 percent guarantee so it is indeed a risk
2986772 our target is the gold but no one says they can have assurance
2986773 i cant believe it has all ended with a fall
2986774 you only have a second to make a decision and i made the wrong decision
2986775 hopefully in london 2012 olympics ill come out more experienced and have a better chance
2986776 there are half a dozen different locations where the pot growers are dumping equipment and soil and its not just regular potting soil its laced with chemicals and pesticides they dumpers have to use rubber gloves to handle it and then they leave the gloves behind
2986777 not only does this stuff look bad it is not a healthy thing for the wild animals in the area they can get injured by this stuff
2986778 in the fall or early spring during the deer hunting season people are leaving carcasses ive also seen cows dropped off just left to rot or when people have pets die they just drop them off
2986779 if they get into the stream system there are some people in this area who actually take their water supply from the creek they could get really sick even die
2986780 ive seen everything tossed in the woods from kitchen sinks to old refrigerators and sofas its very frustrating
2986781 tree branches are not litter animal parts and carcasses are not litter litter is things like plastic bags and garbage
2986782 the litter act was designed for people throwing things out car windows more than anything if someone drives down the road and tosses a mcdonalds burger wrapper out the window that falls under the litter act i dont think when they made this legislation that it would would deal with people dumping garbage in the woods
2986783 we have to have something to investigate just saying there is someone dumping garbage wont help us depending on whats on our plate on a particular day it may not be a high enough priority to investigate
2986784 this will be an excellent addition to the services we offer our small business community
2986785 bizpal will allow our entrepreneurs a more streamlined and simplified start up process
2986786 the government of canada is pleased to be working with the province of british columbia and the district of peachland to promote a more competitive and productive local economy by providing easy access to essential information and reducing paperwork costs for business
2986787 kelowna reported a total rainfall of 8 5 millimeters there was some intense lightning we were recording a lightning strike across the okanagan every three to five seconds
2986788 there were reports of hail up to 20 millimeters in diameter reported in the penticton area the penticton airport recorded total rainfall of 45 6 millimeters thats a lot of rain to come down in a short amount of time
2986789 on our arrival we found fire in the basement area of the building there was heat damage to the basement area which was used for book storage and an office area and smoke damage to the rest of the building there was no structural damage and only contents were affected
2986790 there was no one occupying the building it was used as a church office building
2986791 it meant so much to our family that our fellow kelowna residents came out to support connor and canadian blood services
2986792 my son would not be where he is today if not for the blood donated by generous canadians and for that we are truly grateful
2986793 the support we received from the community throughout this blood drive was fantastic
2986794 this years dka mardi gras promises to be another successful event for us there are three stages of live entertainment throughout the day a huge kids zone street performers sidewalk sales and much more we have been working hard since last fall to make this an excellent day for families and our businesses alike
2986795 while commodity costs continue to be extremely challenging we have been able to offset some of these increased costs with a combination of operating expense reductions and price increases
2986796 in the face of continued extraordinary raw material cost increases we are working diligently to redesign our brand package channel pricing architecture as this is the key driver of both revenue and gross margin
2986797 very challenging operating environment with the sluggish economy and increased commodity costs
2986798 the people of glasgow east have delivered a crushing vote of no confidence in the prime minister and his labour government in westminster they have shown decisively that nobody knows what labour stands for anymore
2986799 the conservatives brag that they have leapt into third place but despite what they say their actual vote share in glasgow east was down
2986800 the conservative party needs to retain a sense of perspective about this result
2986801 allows us the opportunity to secure our future in an increasingly difficult industrial and economic environment
2986802 there are those who would suggest that we would be better served by simply rejecting this agreement that all we have to do is simply go back and get more
2986803 or they argue the agreement favors the northwest pilots over the delta pilots in one respect or another but upon closer analysis these views are many times based on a misunderstanding of the agreement a misinterpretation of its terms a failure to acknowledge todays economic realities or simply anger
2986804 i managed to sleep for another three hours but the sleep didnt take away the pain that im dealing with now
2986805 my mother encouraged him to go fulfill his dream and make his father proud
2986806 this would have been his will i think any elite athlete could relate to this feeling sometimes you just feel deep in your heart what the right thing is to do
2986807 i know how hard this has been on alon and were just doing everything we can to support him
2986808 alon decided several years ago when he was probably half the size he is now and when i still as able to beat him up that he was going to be an olympian
2986809 we all thought he was crazy because his times were so much slower my father even bet him that if he made the olympic team he would shave his mustache
2986810 he shaved it the day alon left with the team for the olympics
2986811 touchstar is a logical partner for ipc because touchstar has been a very important contact center technology provider in the philippines over the last seven years touchstar contributed technology and expertise to help many philippine call centers grow i know that touchstars core value of customer service made a difference for many businesses
2986812 ip converge is the information technology and telecommunications leader in the philippines touchstar chose to partner with ipc only after we completed a thorough review of their customer service levels training programs and technology expertise ipc is one of the most impressive value added it services companies that we have worked with in the world
2986813 white castle is a cult brand with a tremendous amount of online brand advocates which is a very high engagement community this new site brings the fast food brand into the discussions that are already happening out there and engages these brand advocates in authentic meaningful and remarkable ways
2986814 because we function as strategic partners with our clients we opened a west coast office to better serve our business relationships in that part of the country
2986815 brians leadership and drive not to mention the impressive team he has developed have allowed us to achieve that objective this promotion is a fitting recognition for all that he has accomplished
2986816 it has been enormously rewarding to watch brian grow and develop the san francisco office into the success it is today
2986817 from the outset i had complete confidence in brians abilities to make this office a success and he has more than delivered
2986818 brians efforts have been tireless and his results speak for themselves
2986819 not only does he have the business acumen to get the job done brian also possesses tremendous search knowledge and expertise we are delighted to acknowledge his hard work and dedication with this promotion to executive vice president
2986820 this effort continues the growth of iss leadership in international c2 development we are excited about the opportunity to help nato define their future command and control capabilities

2986822 our customers choose hartmann products because they are the finest most reliable travel goods available our new website is further evidence of that dedication to provide our customers the very best
2986823 they spent the last few years trying to integrate it
2986824 there are a lot of questions that a buyer and the government would have to have
2986825 its not exactly a healthy asset its a sub scale narrow band network that has limited capacity and has a subscriber base thats leaving in droves
2986826 improving operations making additional investments entering into strategic partnerships and considering potential divestitures
2986827 every piece of the business is for sale at a certain price right now because they continue to struggle
2986828 even if they want to sell iden i dont think theres a buyer
2986829 phone differentiation used to be about radios and antennas and things like that we think going forward the phone of the future will be differentiated by software
2986830 the judgment announced today is the highest award ever given to a professional sportsman or sportswoman thankfully injuries of this severity are not a common occurrence on the football or any sporting pitch so i do not see this successful claim opening the floodgates to litigious action by sportsmen
2986831 i dont see anything ground breaking in this if i had been involved in a car crash and suffered brain damage and could not fulfil my career i would be entitled to claim so i dont see why this case should be any different
2986832 by all accounts ben collett was already a very good player and had great potential sir alex ferguson said so and so did many others if he had hung around in the game he would have earned significant sums of money but we are not always in charge of our own destinies
2986833 it is still under investigation whether it was connected with other organisations
2986834 there is no clear evidence to show the august 10 explosions had anything to do with what happened in kashgar
2986835 it is appropriate in our view that the indian refining industry which has world sized companies be placed on par with the international refining business
2986836 anarchy media player wp spam plugin best free stuff computerworld
2986837 the current system is not working bail is too easily granted frequently breached and improperly enforced
2986838 public confidence is undermined when bail conditions are routinely breached offenders hold the criminal justice system in contempt and new victims of crime are created unnecessarily
2986839 we have been able to prevent the failure of the cleaning mechanisms and to prove that
2986840 we will start screenings of compounds that could have the same effect we are also experimenting with different changes in diet that may also mimic this effect
2986841 even more important these results show that its possible to correct this protein logjam that occurs in our cells as we get older thereby perhaps helping us to enjoy healthier lives well into old age
2986842 theres reason to hope that drugs exerting a similar effect throughout the body may help us enjoy healthier lives well into old age

2986848 de elf die tegen lazio de laatste oefenmatch hebben gespeeld starten woensdag ook
2986849 het is eigenlijk te gek we hebben hier nu twee kazernes staan op 500 meter van elkaar dat is niet effici nt
2986850 er is ook het probleem van de beschikbaarheid we hebben hier goede brandweerlieden maar die werken meestal buiten de gemeente
2986851 we zijn echt razend het is onaanvaardbaar dat de stakers en hun vertegenwoordigers de vakbonden opnieuw de onschuldige reiziger treffen
2986852 dat mensen die het hele jaar hebben gespaard om op reis te gaan hierdoor worden getroffen is wraakroepend
2986853 van zodra dat wel het geval is zal de vvr naar de rechtbank stappen
2986854 we vragen dat de overheid nu echt werk maakt van een regeling voor minimale dienstverlening bij stakingen in dergelijke gevallen
2986855 sommige spelers hebben geluk op de belangrijke momenten ik niet
2986856 hey thanks for the lileks com link where i just spent over an hour scrolling through
2986857 everyone i such an ass i totally forgot that i agreed to let my
2986858 deb amp kelley thank you both im not sure what happened but im not getting
2986859 no issues here either i have windows xp home with ie 7 0 love your site
2986860 be angry and do not sin do not let the sun go down on your anger
2986861 we need the unity of the olympic movement to help us overcome the difficulties our major responsibility is for offering good games to the athletes who deserve them
2986862 the athletes deserve and the world expects it and the unity of the olympic movement will deliver it
2986863 any politician who is pushing for a boycott is committing a serious error
2986864 for me a total boycott a partial boycott is totally out of the question
2986865 it is important for asian countries to stand behind china as the success of the beijing olympics is the success of asia
2986866 i am sure beijing 2008 will be the best games because beijing has worked for the games for more than a decade
2986867 thats been confirmed by all the previous experience we believe sport is there to promote dialogue and international understanding sport builds bridges not walls
2986868 the 2004 olympic games in athens is the first time to carry the olympic flame throughout the world the beijing olympic torch relay will again bring the flame in five continents spreading the olympic spirit of peace mutual respect inspiration and cooperation among all nationalities
2986869 the beijing olympic flame journey will for sure promote world peace olympic ideal and olympic movement the beijing games will leave great legacy for the world and the flame relay is an important part of that
2986870 the olympics should not be about politics it should be about sport
2986871 the torch relay is supposed to be about introducing the world to the olympic values
2986872 to bury that message under other stuff that has nothing to do with the olympics is wrong
2986873 its exciting to see people come out to celebrate sports and the olympic value i went to oxford street relay today and found people understand whats olympics is about
2986874 as long as the interest of the athletes is all put first then the game would be a great success
2986875 meanwhile i strongly oppose any assault or attack to the olympic torch
2986876 everyone has a right to express themselves but to stop it passing shows a lack of respect for the basic freedom of our athletes to carry this flame which is a message of peace to the whole world
2986877 if you look at the history of the olympics people came together regardless of what their feelings toward each other were in greece they were fighting wars and they called a stop so that people could come together and celebrate sports
2986878 i think thats what the olympics is about what the olympic flame symbolizes and i do hope that we can set politics aside enjoy the festival of sports that the olympics is supposed to be and also respect the torch for what it symbolizes
2986879 qatar olympic committee would like to state that it does not agree with the various calls to boycott the olympic games in beijing qatar olympic committee strongly supports this important sporting event and it will endeavor to contribute to its success
2986880 the international olympic committee president dr jacques rogge has said we shall let sports be sports politics be politics i fully support his point of view
2986881 the main goal of the olympic torch is to unite youths around the world win or lose we shake hands and maintain peace and friendship the games in beijing will be important for kenya in promoting peace in the country and we should ensure we are ready
2986882 the preparation for the olympics has brought major changes to beijing the city has widened its roads built new underground lines and renovated cultural relics
2986883 first of all i believe that the beijing olympic and paralympic games are going to be very successful and the tokyo 2016 bid committee wishes all the best to china and beijing for the games
2986884 we firmly believe that the beijing olympic and paralympic games will act as a focal point for bringing peace through sports to many people
2986885 the olympic sacred fire is a symbol of peace tolerance and should not be affected by anybody in any way
2986886 sports and politics are totally different things and the true olymipc idea is to bring the youth together from every where around the world and to establish friendship respect and mutual cooperation
2986887 the torch is the symbol of the olympics and sports should be separated from politics in a word olympics should not be manipulated
2986888 every country and region on route should make it safe for the torch and the bearers or it would be a shame for the olympics which is a pure sports event
2986889 i think the countries and regions should enhance protection for the torch relay and avoid such embarrassing events
2986890 authorities in the related countries and regions should make better preparations
2986891 of course we should condemn any disruption on the torch relay
2986892 after all the torch belongs to the olympics and olympics belongs to sports
2986893 i think the torch relay adds to the prestige of the games i see no reason why it should be canceled
2986894 it would mean the world to me if i was chosen to carry the olympic torch in my home country as it will motivate me further to succeed and become a role model for the next generation of disabled athletes
2986895 people shouldnt use athletes who have trained hard to make political points if the issues are strong enough that the nation and government want to take a stand together against another country sports people should stand with that but they should not be misused to make a point
2986896 the olympics is a unique event and we should celebrate that fact as the torch which marks the start of that olympic event comes to the streets of london this weekend
2986897 of course we would all be foolish not to have some anxiety but i do not have fear
2986898 i might get jostled i might get knocked down but i dont have any considerations about not participating in the olympic torch relay
2986899 i am happy and very fit to carry the torch i am preparing for the olympics as well
2986900 it is a great honor for me particularly as an athlete of winter sports a bit of novelty
2986901 in the past the skating had been left out in turkey but now an increasing number of boys and girls are showing interest in skating
2986902 this is my fifth time to be an olympic flame torchbearer i was running in the atlanta sydney athens summer games and the turin winter games before each time its a different feeling the more times you participate in the flame relay the better you love it
2986903 this is a wonderful day for all athletes spectators and sport fans around the world that signifies the start of the world tour of the olympic flame
2986904 i never expect to become a torch bearer for the upcoming olympics but it is meaningful to inform the arrival of the olympic flame to the people of the world and increase the awareness for the olympic movement i feel so excited to get involved in the torch relay
2986905 there has been no cabinet discussion of this no cabinet discussion is planned i dont anticipate any kind of boycott of the games themselves
2986906 experience would suggest that such boycotts are generally not effective and really in the end only harm the athletes involved who have trained for so many years to compete in these events so i dont see either in this country or internationally a push for that
2986907 ive said before and ill say it again i dont believe that olympic boycotts are productive
2986908 im a strong believer in not mixing athletics with politics and therefore i think it is good if we follow through the olympics politics should be talked about between politicians
2986909 beijing olympics is a major event that should not be missed so many people are looking forward to it the olympics especially the summer olympics is always the number one thing for the world in getting together and competing in athletics
2986910 russia is against a boycott of the beijing olympics and considers it unacceptable
2986911 we dont welcome attempts at boycotting the olympics that are a most important world event
2986912 in any case one cannot approve of the use of violence to block the olympic torch relay no matter what reason there is behind such behaviors
2986913 it is a great honor for our city to participate in the beijing2008 olympic torch relay and once again extend our friendship and cooperation to other nations
2986914 this years olympic torch relay is especially significant to london as we will be the next olympic host city
2986915 this is a great opportunity for london to experience the excitement and opportunities that the games will bring us in 2012
2986916 i am very confident that the beijing olympics will be a very successful event that can be examples for the world
2986917 san francisco has always been proud of our strong cultural ties to china and beijing
2986918 the olympic torch represents the journey for excellence and we are honored to have the opportunity to host and contribute to the beijing olympic journey of harmony
2986919 speaking as the mayor of san francisco i am a firm believer that olympics is to unite the people and the world through sports
2986920 we wish the beijing games all success and i am sure that all who participate in the games will have a wonderful experience
2986921 today is a very special occasion for us because london is looking forward very much indeed to hosting the olympic and paralympic games in 2012 the city is very supportive of the 2012 olympic games and the benefits they will bring to london and to londoners
2986922 the olympic flame sends us a message of solidarity respect as well as the olympic ideal which is deeply rooted in our history
2986923 tomorrow the flame will go to beijing to start the journey around the world i wish the 2008 games will be a success in the country with a history as old as greece
2986924 todo lo que pas cuando formaba parte de la oposici n y hablaba de todos estos temas
2986925 no podemos someter so pretexto del di logo o el respeto a derechos de raigambre constitucional hacer primar en forma absoluta unos sobre otros en perjuicio de aquellos que est n en plena imposibilidad de poder ejercer sus derechos por s mismos
2986926 alguna respuesta merecen estos peque os ciudadanos que en el futuro seguramente van a poner de manifiesto los reproches
2986927 asumir los costos pol ticos sin saber que lo que se est pagando es inconmensurable que ac nadie sale beneficiado que la ciudadan a mira incr dula lo que est sucediendo con un sector de la comunidad que no es un sector de variables econ micas sino de variables de vida y a veces no tiene recupero con el transcurso del tiempo el estado no puede permanecer ni en silencio ni que con el devenir del paso del tiempo esto pueda encontrar su cauce natural o por decantamiento
2986928 ejercer el gobierno ejercer el poder y la funci n para lo que se los eligi
2986929 la apertura de las listas intimando a los docentes que est n en medida de paro a reincorporarse bajo apercibimiento de ponerlos en disponibilidad
2986930 tiene las herramientas y si no las tiene se tiene que ir si el ejecutivo dice que no las tiene se tiene que ir porque ignora los elementos que le da la constituci n para solucionar estos problemas
2986931 que se interprete con el sentido que le doy porque nunca va a faltar alg n trasnochado que diga que estoy propiciando un pedido de destituci n lo que quiero significar es que quien asume los riesgos de ejercer el poder en nombre de los ciudadanos tiene que saber que entre esos riesgos est el de tomar decisiones que seguramente pueden contradecir algunas de las ideolog as
2986932 un juez se tiene que expedir porque le tiene que ordenar al estado que cumpla con su obligaci n constitucional de asegurar la educaci n p blica
2986933 hay jurisprudencia del resto del pa s donde un juez orden al poder ejecutivo instrumentar los medios necesarios para asegurar el cumplimiento de la manda constitucional de asegurar la educaci n
2986934 que d cumplimiento a la manda constitucional que pesa sobre l
2986935 una cosa es una expresi n de deseo y otra cosa es una orden en este caso creo que el poder judicial debe dictar la sentencia y ordenar a que el ejecutivo proceda a dar cumplimiento a la manda constitucional porque si no la cosa no se toma en serio seguimos en una serie de tecnicismos y se mantiene una serie de cosas que no dan respuesta a los ciudadanos que tienen derecho a exigir que se cumpla con determinada obligaci n de parte de quienes tienen que cumplirla
2986936 no hay derechos absolutos todos los derechos son relativos y se ejercen en conjunci n con el inter s comunitario dependen de la circunstancia y ac no tengo ninguna duda de que el derecho a aprender de los ni os est por encima del derecho constitucional de huelga
2986937 para m lo obvio resulta tan dif cil de explicar que cuando uno lo quiere hacer cuesta esto es obvio el poder judicial tiene que ordenar al poder ejecutivo que cumpla su obligaci n la ense anza primaria gratuita libre hoy no lo est asegurando y un poder del estado que est con la funci n de hacer cumplir estas cosas no puede decir le aconsejo que la cumpla tienen que decir le ordeno que la cumpla lo intimo a que la cumpla dentro de tanto tiempo bajo apercibimiento de considerarlo incurso en incumplimiento de deberes de funcionario p blico de sus funciones o lo que corresponda en el caso
2986938 seguir dando vuelta sobre el mismo c rculo ac los datos objetivos de la realidad indican que hace varios d as los ni os de tierra del fuego en su inmensa mayor a no tienen clase
2986939 qui n puede poner en tela de juicio que la educaci n p blica no es un servicio esencial
2986940 nadie puede ponerlo en duda est fuera de toda discusi n que la educaci n p blica es un servicio p blico esencial y ah est la respuesta a qu lugar ocupa el derecho de huelga en la pir mide jur dica
2986941 si en esta circunstancia hay que determinar una primac a de derecho en este momento el derecho de los ni os est por encima del derecho de huelga porque tampoco estamos hablando de cuestiones de vida para quienes est n llevando adelante el ejercicio del derecho de huelga pero s para aquellas personas en las que est depositado el futuro de la sociedad
2986942 el fiscal de estado tiene como funci n de acuerdo a la ley provincial nro
2986943 deslindar responsabilidades como si lo que se estuviese tratando como tema esencial fuese un tema secundario cuando en realidad es un tema primario que hace al sustento y al futuro de la provincia
2986944 todos tenemos una cuota de responsabilidad en mayor o menor medida pero quienes m s tienen parece ser que no la ejercen si el fiscal de estado considera que su participaci n es oportuna me parece bien que incursione en este tema haci ndole saber al ejecutivo que su obligaci n es ineludible y puede actuar de oficio
2986945 hacer solidaridad con la plata del otro ac es muy f cil practicar la ideolog a en desmedro de los derechos de los dem s
2986946 el acuerdo de todos los partidos incluido el psc para no votar los presupuestos del estado si no se cumple el estatut
2986947 lo que no puede ser ha subrayado el l der de ciu seg n informa este partido es que cuando cualquier comunidad aut noma del estado espa ol defiende sus intereses sea solidaridad y que en cambio
2986948 for a banker who is supposed to make his moves sedately and soberly reddy has always surprised the market whether it is the size of hikes or their timing the rbi governor has habitually done the unexpected
2986949 expect 75 bps crr and 50 bps repo rate hike by the rbi in the second half of 2008 09
2986950 to maintain its tightening stance using a combination of repo and crr hikes
2986951 but compared to the drop in growth rates all over the world or our standards it will be a very very marginal moderation
2986952 our internal analysis indicates that barring any further shocks particularly globally headline inflation for the next few months will be around current levels from the second half of the third quarter it will start moderating and by the fourth quarter we are confident we will bring it down to seven per cent

2986967 when implementing an soa users are typically so busy worrying about how to move information that they tend to ignore whether or not it will be understood when it gets where its going
2986968 you can connect things through web services but if your end points dont have a common understanding of whats flowing through the system and if you dont create a data interoperability layer then you wont have accurate communication much less a successful soa
2986969 soa teams that integrate services with an interlocking web of point to point data mappings are undermining the fundamental soa principles of loose coupling
2986970 moreover untangling this web of mappings is difficult and makes change hard and change is the one constant that the business needs to be able to manage deployed effectively a common model provides the flexibility to manage change and the ability to leverage your soa development and integration efforts

2987015 in risposta allappello del presidente napolitano per le morti bianche intendo irrobustire il controllo dei cantieri da parte dei carabinieri con ispezioni a tappeto o anche a campione le grandi aziende di solito ci tengono a far rispettare le regole di sicurezza sono le imprese medio piccole che non le applicano
2987016 siamo contenti delle parole di la russa ma bisogna che i militari che il ministro della difesa vorrebbe mandare nei cantieri siano sostitutivi e non in aggiunta a quelli che ci sono per le strade non vorremmmo che con la passione che il ministro ha per i militari si arrivasse a sostituirli a tutti i normali strumenti di controllo e di repressione
2987017 esiste gi un apparato di controllo del rispetto delle norme sul lavoro sarebbe bene che fosse quello ad essere potenziato

2987079 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

2987091 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2987092 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2987093 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2987094 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2987095 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2987098 his name is wealth he is success and i am friendship
2987099 now go back inside your house and discuss this with your husband who among us should go inside your home
2987100 if thats the case lets invite wealth so our home will be filled with cash
2987101 babe why not invite success so the two of us can finish our studies with doctorate degrees
2987102 friendship please come inside with us and be our guest
2987103 if you had invited wealth or success the other two of us wouldve stayed out but since you invited friendship wherever he goes we go with him
2987104 yes if his fitness levels are right we will watch how quickly he integrates this week
2987105 his team deportivo has been in south america playing the games we played 10 days ago but he looks very fit we will wait and see
2987106 tax and spending issues are typically one of the main focuses of these measures but this time thats less true
2987107 californias measure is distinctly important because the movement to legalize gay marriage thus far has been driven by the courts
2987108 if california voters reject the amendment banning gay marriage it will be the first significant popular affirmation of gay marriage
2987109 they also run the risk of taking much needed resources and attention away from other types of laws that could protect women and their unborn children immediately
2987110 in a down turning economy white voters may be looking for someone to blame for job losses or their poor financial situation
2987111 many of these conservative measures be they abortion affirmative action or gay marriage may be very risky for mccain to touch directly because voters are very focused on the economy and the war
2987112 mccain will have to use proxies to play up these issues because his own stances on these issues have not always been so clear
2987113 every six months there is an announcement that taxes dont matter anymore
2987114 even if the ballot was not marked in a consistent manner some people choose to be creative or non conformists
2987115 when voter intent is clear it should be the overriding factor
2987116 hindsight says we should never have done voter intent back in 2001 im telling you
2987117 we should have gone with the old adage it is what it is
2987118 you know someplace in some race that race is going to be less than a quarter of a percent difference between the two candidates
2987119 the florida democratic party should not open the door even a tiny bit to republican mischief since we know based on 2000 that the republicans will spend millions on legal fees in challenges in order to win
2987120 consequently we must dot every i and cross every t in the proper manner to immunize us from republican attack
2987121 if he wants to live through the eight years hell live through it
2987122 thats a really tough question not ever having run a country
2987123 im not going to run for election or anything but i feel real good
2987124 if i get up and down on my knees on that concrete they kill me
2987125 i cant remember like i did 10 years ago its just different things when you try to think of them they dont come to you as quick
2987126 i think he could do the job in his 90s i think he would be all right

2987128 theres no more important voter in this media market than the hispanic swing vote

2987323 it does not matter whether you believe you can or cannot do a thing you are probably right
2987324 hamdan could be held indefinitely as an enemy combatant but the political explosion that option would touch off makes it all but untenable
2987325 defense department officials said there are concerns about the public perception of holding hamdan after his prison term runs out
2987326 because it could label the military commissions a show process with no meaning to its sentences
2987327 said it has always been the defense departments position that detainees could be held as enemy combatants even after acquittal at military commissions or after serving a prison sentence
2987328 thats always been on our minds in terms of a scenario we could face
2987329 will serve his time for the conviction and then he will still be an enemy combatant and as an enemy combatant the process for potential transfer or release will apply
2987330 it would be totally unfair for the government to hold hamdan indefinitely
2987331 we had a court we had a jury it was a military jury they heard the evidence they gave him five months
2987332 that ought to be his sentence either we believe in american justice or we dont
2987333 the president may yet try to extend mr hamdans detention
2987334 the supreme court has determined that the executive may hold without charge those such as mr hamdan designated as enemy combatants
2987335 it would be unnecessary and unwise to exercise that power in mr hamdans case to hold a man who has been judged to be of minimal risk to the country would make a mockery of the legal proceedings just completed
2987336 said he would not want to speculate about whether mr hamdan would be released at the end of his sentence
2987337 i can reassure you that the defense department is hard at work on this issue
2987338 i n the twisted world of mr bushs prison camps
2987339 it is unclear if mr hamdan will be released after serving his sentence
2987340 captured the absurdity of the proceedings perfectly on thursday night when he called the trial the most historic session of traffic court ever
2987341 mr bushs hapless and often unconstitutional approach to combating terrorism will leave his successor a great deal of work to do the rule of law including fair and open trials must be restored guant namo needs to be shut down as mr mccain has said many times detainees must be put on trial quickly in real courts and those who are not guilty must be freed mr bushs supporters have been crowing over the hamdan verdict as if it were some kind of a triumph in truth it is a hollow victory in the war on terror a blow to americas standards of justice and image in the world
2987342 it has been suggested that this trial at least demonstrates that the commission system is fair unfortunately though the white house has left open the possibility that it will keep hamdan in prison indefinitely even after he has completed his prison sentence this sounds like some scenario out of a third world dictatorship it threatens to make a mockery out of the trial and those expected to follow once the government has submitted a case to a judicial process created by the bush administration itself the president should at least agree to abide by the results
2987343 it follows that the government should release him after he completes his sentence by years end to do otherwise to continue to hold him as an enemy combatant for the duration of the so called war on terror as the bush administration has insisted it can would be absurd if the result of his trial and its sentence do not affect the term of his confinement what was the point
2987344 the rules in this game are not the same as in the civilian courts
2987345 stacked in the governments favor and constitutional rights do not apply
2987346 nevertheless the jury of officers weighed that evidence carefully and rejected the pleas of the government that hamdan be convicted as a terrorist conspirator and sentenced to life in prison these are military officers who must understand better than most that a terrorist released from custody could return to fighting the united states and killing americans by their verdicts and sentence they signalled that they believed the defense argument that hamdan is a small fish not a terrorist shark who just wants to go back to his family in yemen the bush administration should respect those officers judgment

2987542 la cultura reaccionaria est al servicio de los imperialismos y de la clase feudal y hay que derrocarla si no se la derroca la edificaci n de la nueva cultura no ser posible la lucha entre esas dos culturas es una luchar a muerte

2987544 el que logra la adhesi n civil gana la partida
2987545 general usted no me ha dejado nada lo ha hecho todo

2987547 i appreciate the comments you made about the presentation being too long what do you think i could have omitted
2987548 i am so honored and blessed to have the opportunity to host the event to provide funding to the american cancer society
2987549 this event will raise money to help to change the lives of those who face this opponent daily cancer is something that touches everyone it is important that we know that all of us can make a difference
2987550 wunsch frei auch noch so viele frosch k sse d rften kaum zu einem sorgenfreien leben f hren man muss sein leben schon selbst in die hand nehmen
2987551 unbemannte aufkl rungsflugzeuge f r zivile und milit rische zwecke
2987552 dank der von den gr nen lange jahre geforderten wahlaltersenkung haben jugendliche nun immerhin die m glichkeit die politische landschaft des landes mit zu gestalten
2987553 der im regierungsprogramm angek ndigte jugend check f r gesetzesvorhaben wurde ebenso wenig umgesetzt wie die verankerung der kinderrechte in der verfassung nach den vorstellungen von jugendministerin kdolsky soll die bundesjugendvertretung strukturell ausgehungert und k nftig an der kurzen leine des ministeriums gehalten werden gleichzeitig kokettiert innenministerin fekter mit damit die strafm ndigkeit zu senken und sogar schon 12 j hrige vor den richter zu zerren
2987554 weite teile der vp betrachten jugendliche mittlerweile als kollektive problemgruppe die man nur mit immer weiter reichenden restriktionen und abschreckungsma nahmen stichwort schnupperaufenthalt im gef ngnis zu disziplinieren vermag die vp erkennt ganz offensichtlich nicht welches kreative kritische und konstruktive potenzial dadurch verloren geht
2987555 delikte wie ehrenmord zwangsverheiratung und genitalverst mmelung sind bereits jetzt strafrechtlich verfolgbar und deshalb besteht auch keine veranlassung einen neuen paragrafen einzuf hren
2987556 solche vorschl ge die den eindruck entstehen lassen dass diese verbrechen nicht strafbar w ren f hren letztlich nur zur verwirrung der betroffenen und sind auf das sch rfste zur ckzuweisen
2987557 es w re aus sicht des kinderschutzes sehr schade wenn das gewaltschutzgesetz in seiner von justizministerin berger nun vorgeschlagenen version also nun ohne die von uns abgelehnte anzeigepflicht auf nicht absehbare zeit verschoben oder auch fallengelassen werden m sste insbesondere die m glichkeit der ausdehnung von prozessbegleitung auf das zivil und au erstreitverfahren entspricht einer langj hrigen forderung der kinder und jugendanw ltinnen sterreichs und stellt einen wichtigen beitrag zur verbesserung der rechte minderj hriger gewaltopfer dar auch die im entwurf vorgesehenen berufsverbote von sexualstraft tern und die m glichkeit der gerichtlichen verh ngung von besch ftigungsverboten ebenfalls etwa f r den ehrenamtlichen bereich bei vereinen ist ein l ngst notwendiges instrument zum schutz von kindern und jugendlichen vor gewalt
2987558 die erkenntnis dass es derzeit eine steigerung bei den anzeigen gegen unter 14 j hrige also noch strafunm ndige gibt l sst in keiner weise denn schluss zu dass unsere kinder krimineller werden s mtliche internationale studien best tigen dass die anzeigenbereitschaft in der bev lkerung gestiegen ist und so die statistik sich erh ht hat
2987559 unverst ndlich dass einerseits st ndig eine f lschlicherweise gestiegene jugendkriminalit t angeprangert wird und dann wird das geld f r das jugendkompetenzzentrum der justiz vom finanzminister einfach gestrichen
2987560 aufgrund von regierungsbeschl ssen im lauf des letzen jahres hat mein ressort einen gesetzesentwurf erarbeitet der den schutz vor gewalt insbesondere bei kindern verbessert und die opfer von straftaten umfassend unterst tzt
2987561 unabh ngig vom umweltschonenden aspekt dieser ma nahme sehen wir vor allem die f rderung der mobilit t und die m glichkeit zur entlastung der studierenden als hauptargumente f r die umsetzung eines sterreichtickets
2987562 f r studierende pr senzdiener zivildiener und pensionisten sollte ein solches ticket maximal 450 euro kosten
2987563 viele verkehrsbetriebe bieten ernsthafte verg nstigungen nur w hrend des semesters an f r studierende muss es jedoch auch m glich sein in den ferien ffentliche verkehrsmittel zu angemessenen tarifen zu verwenden
2987564 we now know that these other planetary systems dont look like the solar system at all
2987565 we now better understand the process of planet formation and can explain the properties of the strange exoplanets weve observed we also know that the solar system is special and understand at some level what makes it special
2987566 ma nahmen gegen die teuerung sind f r junge genauso wichtig wie f r ltere
2987567 es wurde genug gestritten und lang genug gewartet setzen wir es einfach gleich um
2987568 gleichzeitig lade ich die vp ein die weiteren notwendigen entlastungsschritte mitzut tigen
2987569 warum sollten die kleinsten von der erh hung ausgeschlossen werden sie brauchen genauso unsere unterst tzung
2987570 in zeiten wo viele menschen im land mit der teuerung schwer zu k mpfen haben ist es unappetitlich und ungeheuerlich wenn der sp chef sein amt als infrastrukturminister als plattform f r pers nliche zwecke ben tzt und dabei unverhohlen unmengen von steuergeldern verprasst
2987571 dieser fall erinnert sehr stark an die g ngigen sp methoden aus den siebziger und achtziger jahren wo alle m glichen steuergeldt pfe von der sp vereinnahmt und wie ein selbstbedienungsladen gef hrt wurden faymann w re gut beraten davon abstand zu nehmen scheinbar ist das aber ein teil des faymannschen systems und gibt einen sehr guten einblick in sein verst ndnis von politischer arbeit f r die menschen im land
2987572 bei auftr gen in summe von zwei millionen euro kann man nicht zur tagesordnung bergehen
2987573 sollten sich nicht gen gend sterreichische investoren finden so ist es klares ziel dass die anteile bei der iag verbleiben
2987574 damit w rde sicher gestellt dass die interessen der besch ftigten der aua auch in zukunft mit ber cksichtigt werden k nnen
2987575 man muss sich genau anschauen welcher partner welche voraussetzungen mit sich bringt damit sowohl die aua als auch der standort wien davon profitieren
2987576 sollte es morgen nicht zu der von zahlreichen experten so eindringlich geforderten verbesserung des gewalt und opferschutzes kommen so hat das allein die vp zu verantworten allerdings hoffe ich noch auf ein einlenken im sinne der vernunft und der humanit t
2987577 vor der durchsichtigen wahltaktik einzur umen der justizministerin offenbar vor der wahl keinen erfolg zu g nnen
2987578 we make a living by what we get but we make a life by what we give
2987579 i wonder if feedburner is counting all of my subscribers
2987580 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are trying to get in the way
2987581 its military transport aircraft to relocate georgias military contingent from iraq virtually into the conflict zone
2987582 it will be a 1 billion marketplace at some point in time
2987583 never seen anything like this in my career for software
2987584 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
2987585 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
2987586 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
2987587 we should definitely take steps to limit our exposure to the substance
2987588 anything we can do to reduce bisphenol a could potentially have big payoffs to protecting human health
2987589 the horse has a heart of gold and is going very well so well keep our fingers crossed but he usually needs the run when he is first up
2987590 his best distance is 1600 metres to 2000 metres but in saying that he did win over 1400 in new zealand in 1 21 59 carrying 58 5kg
2987591 one thing about him is hell always try and he doesnt know how good those other horses are all we can do is line up and see what happens
2987592 he certainly wasnt embarrassed in singapore hed pretty much been in work for a year when he went into that race
2987593 he ran fifth in 40 degree heat and we certainly dont get that at home
2987594 danny is going to give him his last gallop in the morning
2987595 i wasnt happy with her at all last campaign she just wasnt right the whole preparation
2987596 i will be disappointed if reigning to win doesnt step up this time
2987597 he lacked continuity last preparation but i think he can go on with things this time around
2987598 he will head towards the epsom handicap via the tramway and the shannon and i expect good things from him
2987599 a lot will depend on what happens after they work on tuesday
2987600 they will both be entered for the derby but ill decide later in the spring if that is the race for them
2987601 emperor bonaparte is by montjeu so on breeding he is a chance of getting there whereas baci amore might be a query on his breeding
2987602 but my first priority is to get them into the golden rose field
2987603 she led at the trials which was important because towards the end of her last campaign she had a tendency to miss the start
2987604 she won her trial today easily and was under a good hold
2987605 im extremely happy with her and she will go to melbourne next week to run at moonee valley on the saturday
2987606 her main aim is the thousand guineas and i also entered her for the caulfield guineas just in case she proves shes the best three year old around
2987607 her form as a two year old was impeccable and by the time she got to the golden slipper she may have gone over the top but even that was a pretty good run
2987608 i think she is best up to a mile and well plan her campaign around that
2987609 she will start off in the bobbie lewis on september 6 then go up to 1400 metres in the dubai racing club cup
2987610 after that she will go to the toorak handicap the myer classic and if she comes through those well the emirates
2987611 was hei t eigentlich hkl 1 auf dem schild hier
2987612 for us to accomplish that mission we needed to shed a lot of extra baggage
2987613 we needed to focus a little more we needed to make quicker decisions we needed to be ok saying no to certain stuff and we needed to weed through stuff quicker
2987614 one of the coolest things was rick actually suggested that we all stand up and rock out like we would live
2987615 and we did and it put a lot of life into the basic tracking of it all it was almost to the point where when i was retracking stuff i was standing up headbanging id never done that in a recording situation before hes a great song doctor and he has great ears
2987616 the great thing about working with rick is hes never around
2987617 i would say thats a very strong point in that it leaves the four of us to take on the entire brunt of the work and the planning that goes into the songwriting process and the recording process
2987618 bob would add a lot of his own musical input and with that came a lot of his own influences and style and jurisdiction and idiosyncrasies
2987619 and it would eventually make it into our sound but with rick because he wasnt there its almost 100 percent undiluted metallica hed come in and say thats good that isnt change that and we would have to figure that out for ourselves this is the most pure weve sounded in a long time
2987620 rick is not the kind of producer like a bob rock whos there every moment holding your hand making you step up
2987621 rock arranged everything all the time and wore many hats in the studio rick rubin no hat rick comes in and goes well wheres the songs ok thats good thats not so good more of this less of that see you in a few months goodbye and thats what we needed that brutal honesty to get through it and it worked
2987622 so in a way its got somewhat of an older sound songs and arrangement wise weve got a lot more diversity on the record instrumentals fast shorter songs epic ballady moments its quite different from st anger where if youre angry this is your album and if youre not it might take some work
2987623 i may have an artist one day my rosters full i couldnt release him i may call pain you got room on nappy boy records or call kardi whats up with black jays you got room the whole vision was for all of us to always have an outlet
2987624 not for sale thats why you got the bar code over the mouth
2987625 what that represents is all my words all my music my feelings energy and passion i put in the music thats something that couldnt be swayed by the amount of money that a label would pay me at the end of the day any music you hear associated with kardinal offishall is because it means something to me this album is dope because kon allowed me to put it out there and he didnt want me just to stay in a certain lane
2987626 we took rick ross the boss record and just turned it to rudebwoy its just another day in the life a of real ruuuuude bwoyyyy put some auto tune on there the beat was killer from the first time i heard it the way the horns come in and the beat just drops like a new school paul revere you already know anything t pain touches turns to platinum i take my favorite joints even if the rappers are my peoples and i try to do it better
2987627 this was the first official reunion we had since we did the grindin remix
2987628 its produced by my first producer i signed with he goes by the name of the boy wonder soon as me pusha and malice heard the joint we were like we must destroy this i had a joint before thats called swag with myself pusha and lil wayne but out of respect and honor to the clipse i wanted to have a joint where it was just me and the brothers its just us three going in hard
2987629 this mixtape in particular its produced by myself and clinton sparks
2987630 clinton is also down with the konvict family its all a family movement i have a lot of new fans since dangerous but they need to know my history i didnt just come out of nowhere and on the intro clinton produced a timeline of what happened in my life to where i am now
2987631 ive been doing an album with lil wayne its called t wayne the project its basically just going to be an array of things just a visual love the two artists youve seen collaborate with everyone except each other when you see us together its crazy right now we already have what weve done were gonna keep going till they tell us to stop we might even put out a mixtape weve got so many songs that we just might do a t wayne mixtape too
2987632 i think its about time for us to really focus on the music business side of the game
2987633 i think we been doing a lot of street oriented underground catering
2987634 we do what we do and always stay true thats just the chemistry of the clipse stay true to what we are
2987635 i think were gonna open up to a wider audience but keep our same fans too
2987636 if you set up the album in the sense of moods
2987637 i can get some of that soul and some of them drums from sean c and lv i can get some of those stories from j u s t i c e league i dont know what im going to get from dj khalil he has something crazy you can tell they are bringing their a game to it
2987638 you can always rely on the neptunes to come with that old school sound
2987639 everybody is damn near on everything its a platform to showcase everybody and their own individual movements i want this to be a diving board the clipse jump off sandman liva everybody springboard off the situation and keep going
2987640 we got a song called money thats a great club banger
2987641 i think it shows us in a different light partying and having fun but the way we do it its one of the greatest things when you get around cats whose talent level is so high you gotta bring your a game i know theyre gonna bring their a game its great chemistry
2987642 i want this to end when im on top so im planning my final show on december 21 2012 its when the mayan calendar ends its the day when solids become liquids and liquids become plasmas
2987643 so im building up to that weve got four years so maybe theres going to be a couple other small releases in the works the album just came out so i have no plans for another release but im constantly starting to work on new stuff just for the live shows
2987644 i used to play very short sets and now i kinda play a standard 45 minute to one hour set so i think i wanna do a 24 hour set and i want it to be a stage production but one where the lines become blurry between reality and complete stage me i want it to be an endurance test and i want it to be miserable and equally fantastic i want the best of both worlds
2987645 i think in too many shows people are too aimed at pleasing the audience if you want to do a really great show which i havent fully done yet you have to really make it bad for them for like 20 hours and then you can kill it for four hours and everyone will be really excited i think people ignore the dynamics of how you can work with an audience
2987646 the freedom to travel anonymously is fundamentally important to our right to peaceably assemble
2987647 and they made it clear that my reasons for not having id would be a factor
2987648 so the only bit we built specially was the iphone interface its a tool anyone could build but we built it to integrate with the other google products for the iphone
2987649 the write procedure operates in the same way as put datum see section 8 2 12
2987650 the write procedure operates in the same way as put datum see section 8 2 12
2987651 the terrorists were two women mu tielifuhasimu a government official told reporters in kuqa on monday
2987652 the motive was just to create terror in society mu said adding he was unable to say whether the attack was timed to take the spotlight off the olympics
2987653 despite the impact of cheap flights boosting the choice of holidays and short breaks overseas the credit crunch and a recent rise in the euro value have encouraged more people to decide on a uk holiday location
2987654 this is a crucial issue for the hotels and tourism sector just as it is for every business
2987655 it was very surprising therefore to discover that only 7 of the regions hotels and tourism businesses are exploiting the 100 tax allowance on energy saving equipment investment
2987656 promoting the regions superb local food credentials and offering a choice of low carbon holidays in the south west combined with its natural beauty must surely be important components for the regions future tourism strategy
2987657 overall while local economies may experience significant speculative price imbalances a national severe price distortion seems most unlikely in the united states

2987670 i have got to stop everybody has got to stop
2987671 my wife and i intend to retire sell up buy a boat and go sailing that is while we are still young and fit enough to do so
2987672 i have a contract which goes until christmas next year and i suspect by that time i will simply retire and simply disappear
2987673 you will not find me re emerging as an aspiring politician or in any other field
2987674 i hope to be extremely quiet and hopefully a long way away taking the sun on a coral atoll
2987675 there is a real need for more public debate on topics of importance that politicians can listen to to formulate better policies
2987676 as i cycled past in the rain thinking i wasnt enjoying my life much i saw there was a police officer in the car
2987677 and he was lying flat on the drivers seat with his hat over his eyes clearly fast asleep and i though i can do that job just like that literally there and then
2987678 all i can do is be me whoever that is
2987679 this referendum has defeated the remains of centralism has squashed the manipulation of the enemies of true change
2987680 push prices up beyond what customers are willing and able to pay
2987681 in response to what our customers told us we have put forward a plan with prices as low as possible in each year and no sudden price shocks
2987682 this plan does not propose a major infrastructure investment such as we have seen in the past 18 years with nearly 2bn invested in putting in place often first time sewage treatment for communities all round the south west peninsula

2987689 there were a few big boys out there tonight and thats something ill work on
2987690 i got roughed up before but that was something youd expect

2987694 he adjusted his evidence so often that it was apparent that he was manoeuvring himself out of liability
2987695 the occupying power has the duty of ensuring the food and medical supplies of the population it should in particular bring in the necessary foodstuffs medical stores and other articles if the resources of the occupied territory are inadequate
2987696 all peoples have the right of self determination by virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic social and cultural development
2987697 in no case may a people be deprived of its own means of subsistence
2987698 those having responsibility for the administration of non self governing and trust territories shall promote the realization of the right of self determination and shall respect that right in conformity with the provisions of the charter of the united nations
2987699 they laid a fastball in there and he hit it out
2987700 thats what happens if youve got patience i aint worried about chases hitting not at all his hitting is going to come around hes fine hes a good hitter
2987701 obviously i didnt want to hit into a double play but we swung the bats well late in the game thats really all that matters
2987702 weve all been in the batters box hundreds of times with guys on base and without guys on base
2987703 so you try not to let it change your approach
2987704 he still gets his walks when he gets a hit its usually a huge one i think thats the sign of a great hitter to be able to mask those slumps with his tenacity even if hes 0 for 20 having him in the lineup is a weapon
2987705 hes so steady so even keel he does a good job of not riding that roller coaster that a lot of us get wrapped up in thats why as great as he is a lot of us dont notice he may be in any kind of slump
2987706 he makes it look too easy at times hes a huge part of our success this year he prepares every day hes a good guy to have on your team
2987707 bonds is not a fit for us if he would come i would go i wouldnt want to deal with it
2987708 de eenige die wat sympathie voor ons begon te krijgen huet is dood hij ruste in zijn eerlijk verdienden roem hij zal door ons niet worden vergeten
2987709 im going to give it one more day then try to be ready to go about every single day in september
2987710 im not real worried about it at the same time i dont want to keep on plowing through something and make it worse i just need to give it a couple days to get some inflammation out of there
2987711 thats where he could have gotten soreness and hes just now working out of it
2987712 i cant honestly say the all star game is what did it
2987713 i felt kind of funky before that but when i was pitching in a lot of games straight it felt better then it started feeling bad again when i took a couple days off
2987714 looking back there was no real time to say i should nip it in the bud now it just happened to be in the last couple days it became a little aggravated its just a simple case of bicep tendinitis theres no cause for alarm
2987715 it will be nice to play some good ball weve been playing decent ball but i dont think weve peaked yet
2987716 were too good an offensive team to hit the way we have
2987717 all it takes is one pitch one swing one at bat to get going
2987718 and especially to do this in a win is kind of the icing on the cake im very honored
2987719 but it would be great i guess its somewhat of a goal i can aim for but its a goal thats far off
2987720 anytime im put in that situation i want to do what i can to help the team whether it be a hit move a guy over sacrifice fly walk it doesnt always have to be a hit if it ends up being a hit so be it
2987721 you can turn numbers into whatever you want to make them
2987722 to me thats my responsibility to pitch and be successful but i wouldnt be in that situation if i didnt have a good defense behind me
2987723 there comes a time when youve got to do what you think is right
2987724 thats kind of how i manage and run my team
2987725 i will handle things and i do handle things i think its up to a manager not to accept someone showing them up i can understand someone getting upset but at the same time whoever is in charge has to make sure hes in charge
2987726 its been weird this game is crazy were not necessarily putting up booming numbers or playing the kind of baseball were capable of playing but at the end of the day were in first place and we know its going to get better
2987727 its getting to the point where people are starting to count games and its up to us to go out and play good baseball
2987728 we need to get on a little bit of a roll its going to be a tough road trip for us
2987729 we did just enough yesterday and i think thats a good sign when youre not running on all cylinders and can still win some baseball games were playing decent baseball hopefully we can peak at the right time ive seen a lot of teams peak in the middle of the season and have nothing left at the end i dont think weve peaked yet i think we have a lot of good baseball in us
2987730 as i made my turn randy was right in front of me
2987731 i was like oh hi i felt bad i tried to grab him but i think i ended up pushing him i dont round the bag too often i felt like i was in little league
2987732 i think he could run out of daylight in an 8 day week
2987733 recently weve come away with some wins and at times we havent played good
2987734 were definitely capable of playing better and were going to
2987735 his call what the bleep am i supposed to do
2987736 two kind of i guess strong willed people that had a disagreement
2987737 i told him well go in my office and close the door he showed me up on the field and thats not done
2987738 if i could do it again id make sure i had better form but it was great fun and i have the experience now
2987739 i am just going to keep doing the same things i would do in a normal competition but now i have got rid of my nerves to go into the individual
2987740 tom didnt dive to the best of his ability but we are a team and that is why synchro is so tough because you both need to be on form at the same time
2987741 his lack of experience was the reason he wasnt on top of his game today he has had a lot of media coverage over the last few months and he had a lot more nerves than i did
2987742 i have been around the block a few times but for tom i think it was the whole experience of being at the
2987743 both tom and blake will benefit greatly from the experience
2987744 their second dive was a little below par and that set them behind
2987745 it meant they were chasing thats when the wheels start to come off but they will learn from that
2987746 that was a hard event full of very experienced divers which is nothing to sneeze at when you remember tom is just 14
2987747 we were hoping for sixth but its good for him to have it under his belt
2987748 a lot will happen in the next four years by the time he gets to
2987749 we have competed with him before we work together quite often
2987750 i saw the ball go by me off to the right
2987751 after i saw the ball go by i realized i could make it to second but when i turned to go to second base randy was right there i really had nowhere to go i just talked to him to see if he was ok and he said he was watching the ball as well so it was one of those things
2987752 but i dont want to keep plugging through it and make it worse were just giving it a couple days to let the inflammation out the doctors looked at it its no cause for alarm we just want to make sure we nip it in the bud
2987753 my shoulder was feeling sluggish a little before and after the all star game i dont know if it contributed
2987754 this could be an excuse for oil to go up
2987755 with oil at three month lows in a very oversoldcondition it could be due for a pop and that could be onefactor that weighs on the market

2987759 to get him for me was like milwaukee getting cc sabathia
2987760 ive said it before there were times i didnt know if i was going to be playing anymore i honestly didnt know
2987761 there were some scary times too those are all behind me now hopefully i came out of it feeling good and im just really really happy now
2987762 i thought the boy showed fantastic focus a great attitude to work hard and they are qualities to give any player an outstanding chance in the game

2987767 the higher producer price inflation in china is expected to feed into the consumer price inflation and raise the threat of credit tightening again
2987768 we seem to be following the bad news falling with wall street when its on a decline and now tracking the chinese markets
2987769 it is perhaps still too early to conclude that ppi growth has peaked
2987770 the sharp acceleration in producer price inflation seen in recent months is a concern to policymakers as this poses a strong upside risk to cpi consumer price index growth
2987771 in the next few months the authorities will likely further tighten monetary policy and impose price curbs to deal with this inflation risk

2987800 the core i7 brand is the first of several new identifiers
2987801 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2987802 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2987803 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2987804 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2987805 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2987806 over tot de orde van de dag ontzettend veel geneukt dus meneer neukte niet om klaar te komen maar om te stoten overwogen om net te doen alsof ik moe was maar dat leek me net iets te onprofessioneel toen hem maar een paar keer klaar laten komen waardoor hij uiteindelijk ook een beetje uitgeput begon te raken en nog tevreden was ook
2987807 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2987808 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2987809 for both sides the government and the milf i appeal that they be generous to each other so that there is peace and order
2987810 the poor people are dislocated from their homes i hope that peace will reign on both sides

2987813 the air national guardsmen who operate predator drones over iraq via remote control launching deadly missile attacks from the safety of southern california 7 000 miles away are suffering some of the same psychological stresses as their comrades on the battlefield

2987817 in interviews with five of the dozens of pilots and sensor operators at the various bases none said they had been particularly troubled by their mission
2987818 col gregg davies commander of the 214th reconnaissance group in tucson ariz said he knows of no member of his team who has experienced any trauma from launching a predator attack
2987819 on four or five occasions sensor operators have sought out a chaplain or supervisor after an attack chambliss said he emphasized that the number of such cases is very small compared to the number of people involved in predator operations

2987821 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2987822 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2987823 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2987824 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2987825 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2987826 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2987827 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2987828 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2987829 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2987830 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2987831 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2987832 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2987833 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2987834 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2987835 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2987836 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2987837 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2987838 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2987839 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2987840 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2987841 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2987842 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2987843 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2987844 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2987845 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2987846 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2987847 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2987848 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2987849 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2987850 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2987851 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2987852 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2987853 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2987854 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2987855 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2987856 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2987857 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2987858 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2987859 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2987860 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2987861 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2987862 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2987863 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2987864 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2987865 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2987866 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2987867 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2987868 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2987869 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2987870 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2987871 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2987872 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2987873 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2987874 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2987875 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2987876 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2987877 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2987878 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2987879 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2987880 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2987881 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2987882 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2987883 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2987884 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2987885 ill be just making the point in our formal bilateral conversation in jakarta tomorrow that we have 3 of the bali 9 still subject to the death penalty
2987886 ill make inquiries about the progress of their cases through the indonesian legal and judicial system and again make the point that when those processes have completed that if any of those three still remain the subject of the death penalty well be making a plea for clemency in accordance with our normal processes
2987887 the prime minister and i have both made clear that we dont propose to make representations on behalf of terrorists who have been subject to the death penalty
2987888 so i wont be making any individual representations so far as the bali bombers are concerned
2987889 im glad we got caught so no one else would get hurt
2987890 it was so thrilling that we actually got away with it
2987891 im glad it ended when it did it would have been a mess
2987892 i have a lot of people here telling me how unfair the system is
2987893 at some point in our lives you have to have some sort of accountability i cant see how people in my situation deny that
2987894 to know how truly sorry i am and i am willing to pay
2987895 i need to pay back i cant pay back monetarily this is the way
2987896 it was an experience its real strange to think on that and how i got here
2987897 i just heard shots pop pop pop i thought it was the police but no it was us
2987898 my wife was a wonderful person and didnt deserve this i fell for a coed it was stupid i sit in my cell and think how the heck did i get here
2987899 but i was a willing participant you can call it lust i really thought i would get off like a lot of people who are deluded

2987922 they were so deeply ingrained in the news in the second quarter that it appeared there was a small spike in the inventory available
2987923 it was likely fueled by people flocking to the yahoo site to keep tabs on what was going on

2987963 this is absolutely intolerable this new shopping center development would have provided much needed jobs and would have enabled the township to build an updated modern public works facility at little or no cost to the taxpayer
2987964 instead the arbitrary unfair anti business coah rules would have forced local taxpayers to spend 6 million to build 37 affordable houses along with the shopping center in light of the higher coah fees the project was canceled

2987975 sheriff i see you have your pistol are you expecting trouble
2987976 the air and artillery bombardment left the provincial capital without water food electricity and gas horrified civilians crawled out of the basements into the streets as fighting eased looking for supplies
2987977 i thought that since u s is supporting georgia there would be some control over the situation in south ossetia and that there would be a peaceful solution to the conflict but what is happening there now its not just war but war crimes george bush and georgian president mikhail saakashvili should answer to the crimes that are being committed the killing of innocent people running over by tanks of children and women throwing grenades into cellars where people are hiding
2987978 the war is when military fight against military but the georgian army is killing innocent civilians this is genocide
2987979 while the ossetians claimed over 1000 dead the bbc neither reported this or any newsreel coming out of ossetia showing the destruction caused by the georgian shelling of the breakaway republic all we are getting is one sided reports of the destruction being caused by the russians
2987980 the bbc is giving carte blanche to the georgian point of view to be aired on its services while nothing whatsoever is being heard from the ossetian side the bbcs repetitive playing of a statement by george bush given several days ago without balancing these against statements from the russian side indicates where the bbc is coming from
2987981 georgia is an outpost of us and nato forces on the immediate border of the russian federation and within proximity of the middle east central asian war theater south ossetia is also at the crossroads of strategic oil and gas pipeline routes
2987982 georgia does not act militarily without the assent of washington the georgian head of state is a us proxy and georgia is a de facto us protectorate
2987983 in yesterdays attack the advancing tanks were supposedly crewed by ukrainians two unidentified bodies found today are said to have black skin possibly they are americans but we cant say for sure yet we will be able to publish the official conclusions after carrying out special tests
2987984 there are lots of bodies over there a lot of people have been killed mostly ossetians but also georgians they had american emblems on their forearms and they were in black uniforms
2987985 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
2987986 in essence the americans have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals

2988133 what the russians just did is for the first time since the fall of the soviet union they have taken a decisive military action and imposed a military reality
2988134 theyve done it unilaterally and all of the countries that have been looking to the west to intimidate the russians are now forced into a position to consider what just happened
2988135 there is no possibility of drawing nato or the international community into this
2988136 strategically the russians have been sending signals that they really wanted to flex their muscles and theyre upset about kosovo

2988169 we desire earnestly to warn members of our communion against contracting marriages with roman catholics under the conditions imposed by modern roman canon law especially as these conditions involve the performance of the marriage ceremony without any prayer or invocation of the divine blessing and also a promise to have their children brought up in a religious system which they cannot themselves accept

2988184 ich war letztens zum surfen in brasilien und was wussten die leute da ber m nchen dass es da die welle gibt
2988185 wir wollen nicht spa oder spielverderber sein aber das verbot ist derzeit das einzige mittel der verkehrssicherheit zu entsprechen
2988186 wir k nnen nun genauer bestimmen wie diese pflanzen wirklich ausgesehen haben
2988187 der letzte wurde im 18 jahrhundert in chemnitz gefunden und danach beim brand im dresdner zwinger 1849 zerst rt
2988188 das besondere in chemnitz ist dass die b ume an ihrem wuchsort konserviert wurden und nicht etwa durch einen fluss weggesp lt wurden
2988189 an uns ist noch niemand herangetreten es gibt kein angebot von flamengo von einem interesse wissen wir nur aus den zeitungen

2988196 permanent joy for all of the little an annual summertime e post dem leaders issue
2988197 we hereby generously vow to sacrifice our time and effort to secure happiness and freedom from worry for the little people
2988198 we are willing to bear the burden for them nay we are determined to bear the burden and the burden of thinking for them and nothing will get in our way that shows how much we care
2988199 were tired of pretending after 70 years of careful preparation we believe the country is finally ready to deal with the truth there is no need for us to play games anymore if we can send a man to the moon we can meet our peoples needs here at home it is time for us to stand up for happiness now equal happiness for all the workers and little people 1973 2006
2988200 our leaders were frankly exhausted by answering questions about how much taxes they really wanted and about how much government control over life and business they really wanted and how much they deeply care for and want to help people and especially the children they decided that it was time to play it straight and i am confident that the voters will welcome our proposals if not we will have to consider all and any necessary means to ensure true and equal happiness for all it is time to make comrade jeffersons dream a reality
2988201 that is an ugly and vicious slur on our intentions we are totali carei an give us a chance to show the people how much we totally care
2988202 we caringly and compassionately totally care about every tiny detail of your life so we want to know about it
2988203 the person who gives up his individual self and becomes an automaton identical with millions of other automatons around him need not feel alone and anxious any more but the price he pays however is high it is the loss of his self
2988204 this loss of identity then makes it still more imperative to conform it means that one can be sure of oneself only if one lives up to the expectations of others if we do not live up to this picture we not only risk disapproval and increased isolation but we risk losing the identity of our personality which means jeopardizing sanity
2988205 and now i just have to figure out how im going to get home and i think i just thought of the answer and his name is the man and he is an intern
2988206 its possible to make an attack via javascript code or just tcp ip packets storms against intel based machines some of the bugs that will be shown are exploitable via common instruction sequences and by knowing the mechanics behind certain jit java compilers attackers can force the compiler to do what they want for example short nested loops lead to system crashes on many cpus
2988207 how cpu bugs have actually contributed in damaging our hard drives without our knowledge
2988208 a not unblack dog was chasing a not unsmall rabbit across a not ungreen field
2988209 el m ximo nivel de intensidad en todo momento tanto en ataque como en defensa
2988210 pero en el buen sentido hemos trabajado muy duro se ha visto durante los amistosos de pretemporada porque el entrenador ha procurado que la preparaci n fuese lo m s r pida posible tenemos confianza y el ambiente es bueno
2988211 de pivote por delante de la defensa o de interior
2988212 dar siempre el m ximo juegue donde juegue porque la competencia por un puesto es enorme en este equipo
2988213 es el t cnico quien ha de valorar lo que aportamos al equipo
2988214 siempre hay que correr m s que el rival si no lo haces puede haber sorpresas tenemos m s calidad pero hay que demostrarlo en el campo

2988217 really wish your strips werent so funny i just cant muster up the full hatred for you that i want to when you make me laugh
2988218 this site makes me laugh even in the depths of my sorrow
2988219 your site absolutely rocks i immediately bookmarked it keep up the tremendous work
2988220 all the cool red sox fans are addicted to the soxaholix
2988221 were as shocked as you are but there is apparently at least one member of red sox nation with a sense of humor and perspective
2988222 this is by far one of the most entertaining baseball blogs ive seen
2988223 he lived long and happily with rowena for they were attached to each other by the bonds of early affection and they loved each other the more from the recollection of the obstacles which had impeded their union yet it would be inquiring too curiously to ask whether the recollection of rebeccas beauty and magnanimity did not recur to his mind more frequently than rowena might altogether have approved
2988224 if things go right we can start talking about forever
2988225 i expect that most of the people who participate in this project will continue to stay proprietary free after the week is over because they will discover what we already know linux foss and the freedom to choose in our digital pursuits far outweigh the digital hegemony provided by the digital mandarins in redmond and cupertino
2988226 the lindependence events are a good thing since they help overcome one of microsofts biggest advantages inertia
2988227 if not for the event people would just continue using microsoft products because thats what they have always been using and they would be afraid to try something new on their own
2988228 the slow adoption of vista among businesses and budget conscious cios coupled with the proven success of a new type of microsoft free pc in every region provides an extraordinary window of opportunity for linux
2988229 well work to unlock the desktop to save our customers money and give freedom of choice by offering this industry leading solution
2988230 great but can i get one without lotus notes too
2988231 to paraphrase yoda notes leads to anger anger leads to notes consultants notes consultants lead to suffering
2988232 2008 will be known as the year of lotus notes on the desktop
2988233 this is a perfect example on why ibm stays ahead they adapt
2988234 they went from proprietary to open from dos to linux from punch cards to computers despite how old ibm seems they always seem to adapt something that some tech companies refuse to do
2988235 one of the weak points of linux desktops over the years has been access to viable let alone powerful productivity applications
2988236 ibms lotus suite has been around for years is used by billions worldwide and is well understood and well established
2988237 for red hat novell and canonical being able to leverage lotus on desktop pcs is a real opportunity
2988238 if a company is thinking of moving to a new platform this mixture of ibm and these partners gives it some options for having a solid business productivity experience with linux that would not necessitate the purchase of either vista or new hardware to support it
2988239 im all 99 per cent certain but only god can have 100 per cent certainty
2988240 one must not hurry on such serious issues as serious mistakes can be made that have to be paid for a long time afterward
2988241 this is the beginning of a big change in mobile computing
2988242 we would have gotten drowned out with all the noise
2988243 we just thought a boom was going to happen and it really didnt
2988244 we didnt feel it was gaining the traction that we wanted it to
2988245 you are going to study instead of going out because you need it
2988246 that person is not good for you and stop seeing them
2988247 ill help you out with this problem and lets do it together
2988248 push prices up beyond what customers are willing and able to pay
2988249 in response to what our customers told us we have put forward a plan with prices as low as possible in each year and no sudden price shocks
2988250 this plan does not propose a major infrastructure investment such as we have seen in the past 18 years with nearly 2bn invested in putting in place often first time sewage treatment for communities all round the south west peninsula
2988251 why not carlos mancia why not tila taquila why not
2988252 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2988253 remember how you thought i was wasting my time watching tv for 6 years it was experience
2988254 i was involved in the original security implementation on most of the systems and offered to help but the new cso refused our input
2988255 he put keycard access on the computer room and ups room and confiscated any physical keys he could find
2988256 when asked what would happen if the keycard system went down he responded that mechanisms are in place
2988257 i guess mechanisms in place was short for i dont have a clue but someone else will take care of it for me
2988258 within a week the keycard system was hooked up to the ups with a secondary backup battery and was tested repeatedly
2988259 ehi bel fighetto un p di cocco per il tuo culetto
2988260 after i yanked her back all she did was cry
2988261 a lot of people suffer in silence and never seek help
2988262 i look for people filled with a sense of gloom and doom
2988263 i thought to myself why didnt i go visit him talk to him maybe i could have saved his life
2988264 i grabbed him by the waist he hardly fought back
2988265 i pressed him to the ground he started to cry
2988266 in a time of crisis all people really need is one person willing to lend a hand
2988267 i told him to go away its none of your business
2988268 i went to the bridge because its convenient a few seconds itll all be over
2988269 the bridge is about 700 meters long there is no way i can catch up to them i used to feel hopeless like it was all my fault
2988270 by the time i reached her i only got hold of her right leg one of her shoes fell into the water
2988271 she got on her knees and said i want to die please dont waste any more time on me
2988272 he was a big guy and i was on my knees trying to pull him to safety
2988273 i told him brother lets go have a drink and talk when the bill came he pulled up his pant leg and there was a wad of cash still stuffed in his sock
2988274 this college junior wanted to kill himself because his family lost its fishing harvest during a flood and they had to borrow money to keep him in school
2988275 he could no longer afford to take his girlfriend out on a date and she dumped him
2988276 i could tell she had been crying a long time
2988277 on a table nearby her mother had left some steamed bread so she could eat for at least a few days
2988278 i always have to tell them there is nothing i cant solve
2988279 its a lie yet i have to keep on telling the lie to make them think things will get better
2988280 they wish i would devote more time to the family and worry less about things i cant control

2988284 i love him im proud of him im proud of the way he has fought
2988285 hes shown the most amazing strength if it wasnt for his strength his sense of humor he sees the lighter side of all of it
2988286 its been a tough road taking my foot was one of the biggest things and ive had to learn to re walk and started to get some use on my left amy back
2988287 things from the time i got hit to the time i made it to baghdad from there i have real vivid dreams with all the medications and everything

2988294 heres a way we might make the world take a look and see what you think but its up to you i told you at the start that you didnt have to heed me
2988295 im sorry but i dont see the rules your way i dont think your 18th century professor got it right or your 13th century monk or your very dead greeks and your even deader hebrews of this at least i feel sure and i feel pretty sure that your rules are silly and old fashioned and cant be proved unless you assume part of what it is youre trying to prove and id like you to shut up now because im going to close my eyes and listen to my ipod
2988296 sure no rules you win go to sleep now but dont forget that you have preferences about what you see when you wake up
2988297 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
2988298 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
2988299 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers
2988300 oh no first of all if i took one vote away from a serious candidate it would be a sin
2988301 no this hurts more citizens than it would actually help
2988302 giving money and power to government is like giving whiskey and car keys to teenage boys
2988303 these estimated balances could change depending upon actual employment levels and claims filed
2988304 i just hope there is something on some of those tapes the campaign can use

2988317 we found that the core the most central part of the brain is in the medial posterior portion of the cortex and it straddles both hemispheres
2988318 this wasnt known before researchers have been interested in this part of the brain for other reasons for example when youre at rest this area uses up a lot of metabolic energy but until now it hasnt been clear why
2988319 in cinema some films lead most viewers through a similar sequence of perceptual emotional and cognitive states
2988320 such a tight grip on viewers minds will be reflected in the similarity of the brain activity or high isc across most viewers by contrast other films exert either intentionally or unintentionally less control over viewers responses during movie watching in such cases we expect that there will be less control over viewers brain activity resulting in low isc

2988349 the healthy human mouth is home to a tremendous variety of microbes including viruses fungi protozoa and bacteria
2988350 the bacteria are the most numerous there are 100 million in every milliliter of saliva and more than 600 different species in the mouth around half of these have yet to be named and we are trying to describe and name the new species

2988359 i think it is an incredible statement from fcc chairmen who have been some of the architects of the indecency policy and who are now saying that this is out of control the enhanced indecency standard was created under mark fowler and here he is saying boy this train is way off the tracks

2988362 security technologies such as anti virus and anti spyware solutions are effective once malicious code has been identified and confirmed as a mainstream threat and these vendors are doing their best to keep up with the rapid onslaught of new threats
2988363 however because they are predominantly reactive in nature they will continue to fall short when it comes to protecting against real time and zero day threats no solution will ever be 100 percent effective but by adding proactive intelligence gathering techniques to these defensive anti virus technologies the gap between infection and protection can be greatly reduced

2988368 we need russias co operation over iran and derailing that over a localised conflict in georgia makes no sense we just have to hope that diplomacy prevails the next necessary step is for russia to respond positively to georgias ceasefire declaration

2988380 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2988381 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2988382 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2988383 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2988384 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2988385 as a company we are entirely driven and impassioned by the plight of the small business owner and how we can help them gain greater control over the success of their business
2988386 we re fortunate and proud to be able to attract the best and the brightest in arizona and across the country to help thousands upon thousands of entrepreneurs every day
2988387 our client roster inspired us to launch this analysis series due to our customers
2988388 it is very exciting for us to be able to observe first hand such trends as the bucking of the biggest losing streak in the paid search market
2988389 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2988390 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2988391 las simulaciones ofrecen un panorama muy claro de c mo las primeras estrellas se formaron

2988396 i want this to end when im on top so im planning my final show on december 21 2012 its when the mayan calendar ends its the day when solids become liquids and liquids become plasmas
2988397 so im building up to that weve got four years so maybe theres going to be a couple other small releases in the works the album just came out so i have no plans for another release but im constantly starting to work on new stuff just for the live shows
2988398 i used to play very short sets and now i kinda play a standard 45 minute to one hour set so i think i wanna do a 24 hour set and i want it to be a stage production but one where the lines become blurry between reality and complete stage me i want it to be an endurance test and i want it to be miserable and equally fantastic i want the best of both worlds
2988399 i think in too many shows people are too aimed at pleasing the audience if you want to do a really great show which i havent fully done yet you have to really make it bad for them for like 20 hours and then you can kill it for four hours and everyone will be really excited i think people ignore the dynamics of how you can work with an audience
2988400 we have fully integrated our strength in drtv and our strength in web development and it is time that our identity reflects that
2988401 our business model centers on generating results for our clients across a variety of channels including tv online and traditional formats
2988402 for us to accomplish that mission we needed to shed a lot of extra baggage
2988403 we needed to focus a little more we needed to make quicker decisions we needed to be ok saying no to certain stuff and we needed to weed through stuff quicker
2988404 one of the coolest things was rick actually suggested that we all stand up and rock out like we would live
2988405 and we did and it put a lot of life into the basic tracking of it all it was almost to the point where when i was retracking stuff i was standing up headbanging id never done that in a recording situation before hes a great song doctor and he has great ears
2988406 the great thing about working with rick is hes never around
2988407 i would say thats a very strong point in that it leaves the four of us to take on the entire brunt of the work and the planning that goes into the songwriting process and the recording process
2988408 bob would add a lot of his own musical input and with that came a lot of his own influences and style and jurisdiction and idiosyncrasies
2988409 and it would eventually make it into our sound but with rick because he wasnt there its almost 100 percent undiluted metallica hed come in and say thats good that isnt change that and we would have to figure that out for ourselves this is the most pure weve sounded in a long time
2988410 rick is not the kind of producer like a bob rock whos there every moment holding your hand making you step up
2988411 rock arranged everything all the time and wore many hats in the studio rick rubin no hat rick comes in and goes well wheres the songs ok thats good thats not so good more of this less of that see you in a few months goodbye and thats what we needed that brutal honesty to get through it and it worked
2988412 so in a way its got somewhat of an older sound songs and arrangement wise weve got a lot more diversity on the record instrumentals fast shorter songs epic ballady moments its quite different from st anger where if youre angry this is your album and if youre not it might take some work
2988413 i may have an artist one day my rosters full i couldnt release him i may call pain you got room on nappy boy records or call kardi whats up with black jays you got room the whole vision was for all of us to always have an outlet
2988414 not for sale thats why you got the bar code over the mouth
2988415 what that represents is all my words all my music my feelings energy and passion i put in the music thats something that couldnt be swayed by the amount of money that a label would pay me at the end of the day any music you hear associated with kardinal offishall is because it means something to me this album is dope because kon allowed me to put it out there and he didnt want me just to stay in a certain lane
2988416 we took rick ross the boss record and just turned it to rudebwoy its just another day in the life a of real ruuuuude bwoyyyy put some auto tune on there the beat was killer from the first time i heard it the way the horns come in and the beat just drops like a new school paul revere you already know anything t pain touches turns to platinum i take my favorite joints even if the rappers are my peoples and i try to do it better
2988417 this was the first official reunion we had since we did the grindin remix
2988418 its produced by my first producer i signed with he goes by the name of the boy wonder soon as me pusha and malice heard the joint we were like we must destroy this i had a joint before thats called swag with myself pusha and lil wayne but out of respect and honor to the clipse i wanted to have a joint where it was just me and the brothers its just us three going in hard
2988419 this mixtape in particular its produced by myself and clinton sparks
2988420 clinton is also down with the konvict family its all a family movement i have a lot of new fans since dangerous but they need to know my history i didnt just come out of nowhere and on the intro clinton produced a timeline of what happened in my life to where i am now
2988421 ive been doing an album with lil wayne its called t wayne the project its basically just going to be an array of things just a visual love the two artists youve seen collaborate with everyone except each other when you see us together its crazy right now we already have what weve done were gonna keep going till they tell us to stop we might even put out a mixtape weve got so many songs that we just might do a t wayne mixtape too
2988422 i think its about time for us to really focus on the music business side of the game
2988423 i think we been doing a lot of street oriented underground catering
2988424 we do what we do and always stay true thats just the chemistry of the clipse stay true to what we are
2988425 i think were gonna open up to a wider audience but keep our same fans too
2988426 if you set up the album in the sense of moods
2988427 i can get some of that soul and some of them drums from sean c and lv i can get some of those stories from j u s t i c e league i dont know what im going to get from dj khalil he has something crazy you can tell they are bringing their a game to it
2988428 you can always rely on the neptunes to come with that old school sound
2988429 everybody is damn near on everything its a platform to showcase everybody and their own individual movements i want this to be a diving board the clipse jump off sandman liva everybody springboard off the situation and keep going
2988430 we got a song called money thats a great club banger
2988431 i think it shows us in a different light partying and having fun but the way we do it its one of the greatest things when you get around cats whose talent level is so high you gotta bring your a game i know theyre gonna bring their a game its great chemistry
2988432 just because it is has been a quiet summer does not mean dic have lost interest they are happy that things have now become low key and they are awaiting developments

2988437 a unique and indelible influence on generations of music makers
2988438 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2988439 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2988440 this was supposed to have been an enjoyable event but it rapidly turned to tragedy as one of the party got into difficulties after deciding to go for a swim in atrocious sea conditions

2988535 but you never know in this game we must always be careful because if you are not then that is when surprises happen we have more quality but we have to prove that on the pitch
2988536 we are completely compatible but the coach is the one that must decide what he wants to do
2988537 i can play anywhere in midfield that i am needed and i will always give my best the competition for every place in this team is incredible
2988538 we are particularly encouraged by the high gold contents of this recent drilling in portugesas which is a new zone of potential for resource expansion the gold mineralization is associated with the copper sulfides and specularite calcite veining as well as having the potential to augment the resources estimated to date these results should substantially increase the average gold grades the portugesas zone is outside the el espino area of mineral resource estimate calculations completed in february 2008 any significant copper gold mineralization found here will augment the resources being drilled in the main el espino project area we will continue to explore aggressively at portugesas as well as on other parts of el espino and are aiming to complete an updated mineral resource estimate at the beginning of the fourth quarter of this year
2988539 scoring on your debut is something every striker dreams about and scoring so early too was brilliant but it was a bit of a let down to then lose
2988540 at the time it felt good scoring but after the game it didnt feel so good hopefully next time a goal will come with a win and i can have a drink on it
2988541 i scored playing with a small man so it works many smallish strikers will tell you they prefer a big man but pablo is so good in that hole and he can slip me in
2988542 yaya toure will not be leaving he is an important player for the team and it does not enter our plans to sell him
2988543 ledesma carboni and dica will be the backbone of the side
2988544 with those three in the squad i am confident that we can finish in the middle of the pack
2988545 they have shown great movement and they are able to do unpredictable things which pleases me
2988546 as a whole we are working well and i have been happy with what i have seen in the training camp in assisi and in our friendlies
2988547 it is a big game because it is one you look at during the course of the season whether it is the first game or the last game and say it is a game you definitely want to try and win
2988548 the start of the season is here now and we have had long enough to get ready
2988549 i am happy here i havent heard anything about interest from any team so this surprises me it is always nice to hear that someone is interested in you that they appreciate you
2988550 but i just want to concentrate on my team rangers everybody at the club seems quite happy with me and im happy staying i just want to do well for rangers
2988551 i think we need to stop talking about the new signings
2988552 the manager the chairman whatever it is they have to do they are going to do it for the best of the club
2988553 they know what theyre doing the manager is very keen to bring in top players and hes been waiting he doesnt want to bring us two names he wants to bring three or four class players
2988554 theres a black tree in the yard where there used to be nothing

2988556 agencies dont suffer from lack of information they lack an effective means to use it
2988557 spatialkeys value is providing a low cost easy to use means of accessing information previously stored behind impossible to access user interfaces and difficult to integrate data sources these include rms cad and data systems gis tools that agencies have paid hundreds to millions of dollars for as well as spreadsheets compiled by specific units spatialkey creates tremendous value for law enforcement by enabling anyone to map and work with multiple data sources using interfaces tailored to their individual roles and needs
2988558 we chose spatialkey after extensive competitive evaluations because it creates significant opportunities to maximize law enforcement potential
2988559 spatialkey paints a more accurate picture of the trends and patterns in our community and our operations than any other product on the market universal mind has delivered what other vendors only promised a tool anyone in the organization can use to instantly assess report and act on information critical to our mission and community
2988560 were all gutted in the dressing room it feels bad to lose in the last minute
2988561 weve got another game on tuesday now at home to barnsley in the carling cup so weve got to put that behind us take the positives and move on
2988562 ive been pleased with the way things have gone so far bar the brighton result and ive had a good pre season
2988563 ive managed to settle in fairly easily ive been in my new house for a couple of weeks now and my family have moved up as well so its all good
2988564 web 2 0 buzzword is opinionated and vocal but by no means represents the world at large especially on a site like imdb that caters to hardcore movie nerds like myself i loved

2988567 we believe the g s e s will continue to have trouble with both credit losses and capital levels and we recommend that investors remain cautious on the names over the next few quarters
2988568 it is apparent that many republic stockholders have serious doubts about a merger with allied and we believe that many republic stockholders would prefer the certainty of our 37 00 per share all cash proposal
2988569 as a result we trust that republic s board will give our proposal serious and positive consideration and will recognize that it is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a transaction superior to republics proposed merger with allied
2988570 they understand the pay raise and they understand that in these tough economic times they are not getting a pay raise our providers arent getting paid from the state and i think its really hard for them to understand how we could justify a pay raise and i agree with the voters on that
2988571 i was speaking in front of a group just this last weekend and they were very upset with it
2988572 they see cuts coming to substance abuse treatment for state parks for other important state programs they think were not doing our job and how could you not do your job and except a pay raise
2988573 accessing information in the intrests of corporate greed and profits ie advertising dollars
2988574 for anyone whos got concerns about mark wahlberg playing max payne hes amazing in it great actor great guy
2988575 i play an assassin called mona sax who accuses him of murdering her sister and later comes to find out it wasnt him they kind of get together and try to figure out who was responsible for the murder of his wife and child and her sister the whole film is about realising that you can go on a revenge spree and get your revenge but it doesnt solve the problem its a really great dark movie the story actually combines the games max payne 1 and 2 together lots of shooting and gunplay but what makes this script different is that its a really dark sad movie about a man who loses everything and thinks that the only way he can get it back is by revenge and comes to terms with realizing that hell never get it back
2988576 it is realized that the league is incapable of rendering material aid and that the moral influence which may be a powerful force with civilized countries is unlikely to make any impression upon soviet russia

2988581 we would get people directly emailing resumes to the company and theyd get lost or fall off the radar while we were involved in a project managing the process was very difficult and frustrating we had better results with recruiters but outsourcing is expensive agencies which source the type of specialized developers we need typically charge 20 to 30 percent of a hires salary
2988582 one of the great things about standout jobs is the ability to pick and choose which job boards we want to advertise on and manage the process from one central spot high value candidates are pulled from relevant locations around the web and brought directly to the ads career web site
2988583 some boards are paid and others are free but whats important to me is the ability to work them from the standout jobs control panel everything is handled from one spot by the software that saves me time which is better used on my clients projects
2988584 were excited about the opportunity to roll up our sleeves and get involved with the efforts of the lake minnetonka association

2988587 t he news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia
2988588 i repeat the government of georgia has called for a ceasefire and for a resumption of direct talks on south ossetia with international mediators the united states should immediately convene an emergency session of the united nations security council and to call on russia to reverse course the u s should immediately work with the eu and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course that it has chosen we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to asses georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation finally the international community needs to establish a truly independent and neutral peacekeeping force in south ossetia
2988589 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis
2988590 john mccains top foreign policy adviser lobbied for and has a vested interest in the republic of georgia and mccain has mirrored the position advocated by the government
2988591 in the middle of an international crisis in which people are getting killed

2988604 we found that the vast majority of parents were taking their children to a retail clinic as a substitute for regular care either at a doctors office emergency department or urgent care clinic
2988605 about half of the parents said they wanted to take care of their childrens problems more quickly which suggests to us that doctors offices may not be meeting expectations of parents in terms of providing timely care
2988606 the american academy of peditrics is concerned that retail clinics interrupt the care that kids otherwise would receive from their regular doctors when those interruptions occur in care information about childrens health problems which their doctors need to know about can slip through the cracks and that can lead to worse health care for kids in the long run
2988607 the dfb and bundesliga clubs have the same rights as any other society which requires police assistance at its public events
2988608 if security in germany depends on if you can pay for it then this would be more than fatal
2988609 the dfb pays between 100 000 168 693 and 150 000 euros 253 040 for each international game the police have a monopoly for dealing with traffic and crimes and that is what we pay our taxes for
2988610 to pay for police intervention at events would then be like another tax for the dfb
2988611 we are in talks and thats where we stand at the moment
2988612 im settled here so it is just down to myself and the club im very positive about it so hopefully we can get something tied up by the start of the season

2988616 if we can get just a fraction of the results that other cities have gotten when they introduced this program it will be a tremendous success
2988617 we work together to tighten up their leases so that they do criminal backgrounds so they dont allow people with drug histories people with violent crime histories to live there
2988618 criminal histories along with the better communications has been proven to reduce the crime rates significantly
2988619 ames has 11 000 rental units in a town of 50 000 people
2988620 if we could get calls to drop by just 10 percent that would be fantastic
2988621 at the training we will have a lawyer there to help property owners understand how the law works
2988622 there is a big chunk of training on discrimination and how to avoid violating fair housing laws
2988623 we hope to get everyone on board with this and eventually spread it to other surrounding communities
2988624 and the background checks wont stand alone in the process of determining if a person can rent if it is obvious the person is trying to turn their life around they will have no problems finding a place to live in our community
2988625 we are going to try to educate landlords on what they can do to reduce that sort of criminal element in their community

2988662 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
2988663 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
2988664 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
2988665 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
2988666 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
2988667 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos

2988673 absolutely fantastic i said i was happy with the dry setting and with the wet setting and a little bit iffy with the damp setting in qualifying but this morning the rizla suzuki worked absolutely fantastic and fortunately it were slicks all round the first couple of laps were sketchy with a couple of moments then when rutter put me onto the curb and the dirty stuff it were really quite a near do but its one of them things third one on the bounce and totally happy with the way things are going and just all credit to the rizla suzuki team and its working perfect and hopefully you know if it stays like this we will have a another go at making it another race win its obvious what im going to say and id just like to dedicate this one to my man jonesy good man
2988674 weve come this weekend full of confidence and from the last few rounds and the team has made some big progress we have had troubles ive had troubles getting to grips with the honda the last few rounds ive been feeling really confident with the bike and the team have been really behind me and i was so disappointed after that electrical problem in the first race and it could have been another win there but to do it in the second race on my spare bike im just over the moon it was mega difficult to pass and back markers started to come into play and i managed to reel him back in but he shane byrne did go down pretty hard and im just glad really hes ok and we can have another battle next time with each other
2988675 it was disappointing not to be able to make use of the extra power that the new superbike engine would have given us but the decision not to run it became a simple one to make after qualifying before the problem arose it looked as if we may have been in a position to gain a third row start and maybe sneak into the top ten in qualifying as the session progressed though we slipped back to 17th overall while still managing to post the 3rd fastest time in the cup category we now have time to test the new engine ahead of the next round at cadwell park and we expect to deliver the improvements on track that should have been present at knockhill
2988676 we were always going to struggle at knockhill using the standard engine so to come third in the first race and take the win and the top ten overall in the second race has to be seen as a fantastic result for the weekends work hopefully we can build on this and go on to add to the wins and podiums at cadwell park and improve our position in the cup standings

2988687 this may be the first time a physical signature for a personality disorder has been identified
2988688 for the first time to my knowledge we have a specific brain association for people with a personality disorder
2988689 its new and different because its not a lesion or injury to the brain but it is a difference in perceiving information that comes from an interaction
2988690 its not just a matter of bad attitudes or a lack of will
2988691 we have great strength in the area of personality disorders through our relationship with the menninger clinic
2988692 the discovery of a potential new antibiotic is an exciting advance it could mean a possible novel treatment for people with chronic wounds that are infected with mrsa or other bugs by developing the pure antibiotic into a formula such as a cream it could reduce the contact patients need to have with live maggots to heal wounds it could also offer a potential treatment such as an injection or pill for internal infections like c difficile
2988693 it has been a huge team effort to get to this level and i am delighted with our progress however there is more to do if we are to realise the maximum benefits from this discovery
2988694 maggots are great little multi taskers they produce enzymes that clean wounds they make a wound more alkaline which may slow bacterial growth and finally they produce a range of antibacterial chemicals that stop the bacteria growing
2988695 theyre not going to be moving fast so you have to be patient
2988696 this study illustrates the impact flossing can have on oral health the twins experimental model is a powerful tool to help sort out genetic and environmental factors that often confound the interpretation of treatment studies this study demonstrates that flossing can have an important and favorable impact on an individual as compared to that of a non flossing individual with similar genetics and possibly similar habits
2988697 twins tend to share the same or similar environmental factors such as dietary habits health and life practices as well as genetics in this case the only difference was flossing and the outcome was significant flossing may significantly reduce the amount of bad bacteria in the mouth
2988698 as a practicing periodontist i am constantly telling my patients to clean between their teeth more using dental floss or interdental cleaners
2988699 patients tend to think that flossing cant possibly make that much of a difference but this study demonstrates that the addition of flossing to your dental hygiene routine can significantly reduce the amount of periodontal disease causing bacteria even after just two weeks

2988784 i think it definitely helped my confidence and that will be great going into next year
2988785 i know if i can strike out olympic players or get them to ground out i can go into any game feeling confident that i can do the same to players on the opposing teams
2988786 the biggest thing i took away from the whole experience is just the knowledge that these olympic athletes are regular ball players just like the rest of us they can be challenged and they are not unbeatable its neat to be able to see ourselves competing at a high level with such amazing ball players it was a lot of fun because there was no pressure feeling like we had to win we were the underdogs and it was fun to be able to put up a fight

2988804 it appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers

2988947 why dont we split this book into 2 or more smaller books
2988948 ive lost one of my best buddies and it is not easy to reckon with
2988949 my buddy will be missed for many reasons by me he was family he will be a part of my musical life each time i sing the song deja vu as this was a birthday gift to me from him my family and i send sincere heart felt condolences to his family for their enormous loss and we will hold them in continuous prayer
2988950 is a reflection of the times for the banks its a poor economy
2988951 its pretty disruptive the way our austin facility is designed our new facility is designed much more around being able to isolate the flow of individuals
2988952 while our companys growing dramatically we arent consuming more power than we were roughly two years ago
2988953 of organization decided to assign a title to everyone she
2988954 it doesnt matter we humans have an inflated view of our own importance in the universe mortal is what we are what were supposed to be and all well ever be and mortality is enough
2988955 not believing in god is easy you cant prove a negative so theres no work to do
2988956 so anyone with a love for truth outside of herself has to start with no belief in god and then look for evidence of god she needs to search for some objective evidence of a supernatural power
2988957 i used to look at the world and think that there had to be something more but just because i want more or cant comprehend this all being for nothing that doesnt make it so
2988958 so anyone with a love for truth outside of herself has to start with no belief in god and then look for evidence of god she needs to search for some objective evidence of a supernatural power
2988959 is the human race likely or unlikely to have meaning
2988960 your comments that atheism does not lead to joy and promotes feelings of worthlessness are specific to you not atheists in general
2988961 i refuse to use anything but the scientific method to determine what i believe
2988962 life meaningless the human race meaningless depression the foremost emotion of enlightened man surely this cant be right
2988963 and its very self centred to think that this whole planet this whole universe in fact has been put in place just for us with our best interest at heart why are we so special and different from any other creature on this planet
2988964 you cant ask me to explain the worth of humanity like its an equation to be solved
2988965 dont think about it because the future reality is too terrible to contemplate stay with the now
2988966 thats just you darryl athiests dont have to view their lives in those same terms
2988967 another thing that would not sit right with me as an agnostic was that popular opinion told me i should side with the pro choicers and the gay rights people looking around me it seems to be fairly constant that if youre an atheist youre pro choice and if youre a christian youre pro life likewise with homosexuality its beyond the scope of this article for me to go into any kind of debate on those issues suffice it to say that here i was as a lonely agnostic still believing that the christians had got it right
2988968 god only gives you what he knows you can deal with
2988969 now i can agree that the notion of a life that ends in death and all our past dies with it is quite a depressing thought but only if you let it be
2988970 another thing i thought of regarding being depressed i think its only from your view point can you say that my belief is depressing in much the same way i could say your view point is deluded but only from my view or beliefs
2988971 i believe science alone has the answers but i dont know why i believe science alone has the answers
2988972 to summarise your main point you realized you are going to die you didnt like it so you decided not to believe it
2988973 you cant prove god exists so you decide that prove isnt necessary it is ironic that you talked about how easy athiesm can be
2988974 its funny that you would go back to the 15th century tell a scientist about radio waves and then suddenly expect the burden of proof to be on him
2988975 i cant tell if its real our not have i any other means of detemining that besides proof for instance what are the implications of it being real what are the implications of it not being real
2988976 well i dont have a spirit so what you said is outside the picture
2988977 to answer chris it would be an insufficient demonstration that merely involved taking a bunch of djs and radio talk show hosts with you to the 15th century to agree with you when you make your radio wave claims
2988978 oh well the burden of proof is on the after life believer to provide evidence to substantiate his claim
2988979 the past has gone so there is no point dwelling on it while the future is completely unknown so there is no point fretting about what might come all we really have is now the moment thats all that is tangible
2988980 existential pondering is naturally in mans nature but it is a pointless parade
2988981 what will happen will happen all we have is the here and now
2988982 none of us can prove of disprove anything when it comes to the future
2988983 most religions say we will be judged on our beliefs rather than our deeds
2988984 you will be judged according to your conduct and your actions declares the sovereign lord
2988985 will he not repay each person according to what he has done
2988986 he repays a man for what he has done he brings upon him what his conduct deserves
2988987 surely you will reward each person according to what he has done
2988988 according to what they have done so will he repay wrath to his enemies and retribution to his foes he will repay the islands their due
2988989 for the son of man is going to come in his fathers glory with his angels and then he will reward each person according to what he has done
2988990 those who have done good will rise to live and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned
2988991 the sea gave up the dead that were in it and death and hades gave up the dead that were in them and each person was judged according to what he had done
2988992 the holy roman church firmly believes and confesses that on the day of judgment all men will appear in their own bodies before christs tribunal to render an account of their own deeds
2988993 puedo demostrar cari o con alguien que comparte sus hermosos y tristes sentimientos conmigo debemos apoyarnos entre nosotros
2988994 dass die deutsche telekom sich mit der breitbanderschlie ung leider nur auf die gro stadtregionen konzentriert und aus kommerzieller sicht kein interesse an der einrichtung von breitband in der fl che hat deshalb ist es f r diese betroffenen regionen zwingend erforderlich durch eigeninitiative alternative carrier zur telekom f r den ausbau der glasfaserinfrastruktur zu begeistern
2988995 in cases where there is a long history of resistance this is an indicator of death so it is important to try all the possibilities

2989000 thanks to the concern of olympic organizers the chinese government and the cooperation of the korean government we have a huge and unprecedented opportunity to observe a large reduction in everyday emissions from a region that is very industrially active
2989001 capmex is going to be the very first uav campaign in east asia for air pollution and cloud interaction studies
2989002 this will be a very interesting experiment that can never happen again
2989003 black carbon in soot is a major contributor to global warming
2989004 by determining the effects of soot reductions during the olympics on atmospheric heating we can gain much needed insights into the magnitude of future global warming
2989005 ramanathans earlier research on atmospheric brown clouds demonstrated their importance in how solar energy is distributed throughout the polluted regions of our atmosphere
2989006 capmex takes his work an important step forward with new innovative micro and nano sensor technologies that will provide additional quantitative estimates of solar irradiance aerosol cloud interactions climate forcing and important components of the biogeochemical cycles of the east asian and western pacific ocean region
2989007 unsere umfrage macht deutlich dass die bev lkerung mehrheitlich ein integrativeres bildungs system w nscht aus unserer sicht besonders erfreulich ist die tatsache dass die meisten men schen in deutschland bereit sind sich selbst f r kinder und jugendliche aus zuwandererfamilien zu engagieren
2989008 unser bildungssystem muss bessere antworten auf die herausforderungen der migration und der demo graphischen entwicklung geben der ausgepr gte reformwille der bev lkerung ist eine chance f r den z gigen umbau unseres bildungssystems die ressourcen f r bildung sollten verst rkt in den sogenannten problem stadtteilen eingesetzt werden was laut unserer untersuchung auch drei viertel der deutschen unterst tzen w rden
2989009 this year we had to cope with exceptional heavy ice coverage
2989010 we are happy and content that we were able to recover and exchange the equipment considering the extreme ice conditions
2989011 we have been documenting this water mass for years near greenland
2989012 it was almost impossible to provide evidence of it since 2004
2989013 for these purposes we had to relocate the equipment anchored at the seafloor last year further to the north to follow the receding ice and to ascertain that they stood at least temporarily in the sphere of influence of the ice edge
2989014 i stayed in bed this morning and accidentally missed church please dont judge me if we see each other at a restaurant on sunday afternoon and i am clearly wearing clothes that indicate i did not go
2989015 our church had to install speed bumps in the parking lot because despite what the sermon said
2989016 i am a christian with a halo and a unibrow i wear both proudly
2989017 you will see lots of people singing with their hands raised at our church
2989018 i am not afraid to throw skittles in order to wake up a crowd of people
2989019 i cant clap on rhythm during worship songs when i try to bring my hands together its like one hand is thinking one thing and the other is thinking something completely different
2989020 how tired i did get of that woman and those interminable three
2989021 you better come and get your son hes ok but hes crashed his car and is sitting beside it very drunk and the police are on their way

2989024 tempra morale che cos la tempra morale vedete buffo una volta pensavo che fosse dire sempre la verit compiere buone azioni insomma essere un fottuto boy scuot ma ultimamente ho cambiato idea ora credo che la tempra morale sia trovare una sola cosa di cui ti importa davvero quella cosa che per te significa pi di qualsiasi altra cosa al mondo e quando la trovi combattere per essa rischiare tutto anteporla a tutto il resto il tuo futuro la tua vita tutto quanto e magari le cose che farai per ottenerla non saranno troppo pulite ma questo non ha importanza perch nel profondo sai che questa la tempra morale secondo me
2989025 as of 3 30pm 1230 gmt georgian forces renewed intense shelling of towns in south ossetia using various forms of weaponry including heavy weapons
2989026 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
2989027 continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the us
2989028 being a grown up is being able to pay your bills
2989029 stop dont look back just keep picking youll find out
2989030 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
2989031 i believe everyone finds god thru the decisions they make and the path they take thru the situations that come along in life

2989041 my husband had to go to europe for business once for three weeks i totally know what youre going through
2989042 well he signed up for it so its his own fault whatever happens over there
2989043 en bracht tussendoor een mengeling van oude en nieuwe songs van keiharde rock tot knappe ballads
2989044 jullie hebben een prachtig festival en mogen uiterst fier zijn op marktrock een knappe reeks artiesten en anouk in een intieme sfeer op een gezellige marktplaats geweldig toch

2989047 we have a tremendous amount of artistic freedom now were able to express ourselves without boundaries on enigma
2989048 on past albums we spent about four months to record mix and master on enigma we spent almost seven months as we wanted to make sure everything was the best that it could be
2989049 its really about the deterioration of our planet and the policies that have contributed to the current situation of the world
2989050 i do have a different project in the box called o
2989051 thats like really heavy heavy dark groovy music its got influences from neurosis early neurosis meets queens of the stone age meets i dont know what its really heavy and its very funny as well its so weird
2989052 no known people its just me and a couple of friends and when we have all the songs tracked as demos well talk to adrian erlandsson at the gates ex cradle of filth drummer if hes interested in doing some drums well talk to jesper liver d the bass player from burst hes interested in doing it well see its project that needs four guitars so its a pretty loud thing
2989053 no but we made a movie about touring its not finished yet we have some editing to do its named
2989054 i know what it is to be in want and i know what it is to have plenty
2989055 but the firework faking isnt that big of a deal
2989056 no es mas ciego el que no ve sino el que no quiere ver
2989057 the first thing theyll do is stop women from working then theyll force us to wear the veil
2989058 this new vice and virtue movement has the potential to undermine the government
2989059 civil society groups are working hard to modernise society to establish a social contract grounded in our constitution and reflected in our laws a group using religion as a weapon threatens all the progress we have achieved
2989060 zindanis committee represents a big threat that could close the space for womens organisations in civil society
2989061 the medias response was so strong the fundamentalists have lost their case theyre in a weaker position
2989062 we already have plenty of restrictions and obstacles we dont need any more
2989063 our policy was that policing was proportionate to this threat
2989064 the decision to deploy specialist units including dogs and horses is always considered carefully because of the level of resistance officers were authorised to carry batons during two days of the protest
2989065 there are strict legal standards for their use and we gave clear warnings when any specialist team was deployed which is our policy those intent on breaking the law had the choice and opportunity to stop
2989066 the real triumph of this tour is that we havent strangled each other not to say it hasnt crossed my mind or andys or stewarts
2989067 that bloke from oasis said i couldnt play guitar somebody shoulda told him im a f king rock star
2989068 today is gonna be the day that im gonna throw it back to you
2989069 i spoke to john and reni about it a few years ago and they said theyd love to do it at some point in time but ian brown seems dead set against it
2989070 if he changes his mind then well probably do it but then ill be back to primal scream after the one year of doing it
2989071 it is natural to be selfish defensive argumentative full of pride but it is supernatural to be mature loving patient and humble
2989072 of course were incredibly pleased delighted would probably be a better adjective that nintendo approached us but its not an exclusive relationship
2989073 i cant get into details about other folks that are interested in this technology but as you might imagine of course there is more interest out there
2989074 i know i know and it becomes a running joke
2989075 the problem with elite is that we started a project then stopped it thats the problem thats happened its the sort of game we have to get absolutely right its got to be brilliant

2989077 the fact that russia is now going even beyond abkhazia and south ossetia bombing sites near to the georgian capital of tbilisi the fact that russia has mobilised at least part of the black sea fleet off the coast of georgia is entirely deplorable russian military behaviour
2989078 there cannot be a military solution to this it is absolutely clear
2989079 realistically when you toss up that sort of performance youre not going to do much when you get there anyway never mind winning games to get there im not worried about that im worried about how poor we were
2989080 it was the lack of effort that worried me most
2989081 its difficult to put your finger on what went wrong and a week is a very long time in the game
2989082 we didnt turn up to play in the first half we fell too far behind and we cant claw that back
2989083 i sound like a broken record at times ive said this plenty of times this season about conceding that many points and expecting to win games
2989084 during the electronic entertainment expo e3 in los angeles playstation brought out an 80gb model and said there will be no more 60gb ps3s we will be launching the 80gb model during rage
2989085 clicking on links in messages can lead to a malware infection whether the messages are in your e mail or on a site like facebook there has been a flurry of malicious e mails recently posing as links to videos so there s really no excuse not to know that this trick is being commonly used by hackers at the moment
2989086 companies will once again be considering whether it s time to block facebook in the workplace not just for the usual productivity reasons but because of the security threats that sites like this may pose to their organisation
2989087 companies need to make up their own mind as to whether their users should be allowed to access web sites like facebook and myspace during office hours if workers are allowed access to these sites then it s vital that they do not put their personal and corporate data at risk and that they are fully secured against web based infections
2989088 the best defence is for businesses to protect themselves with a web security and control appliance which can filter internet access and prevent the downloading of malicious code
2989089 this is good for everyone in the state not just hispanics
2989090 but in the position i serve i cant make decisions on the politics of it i have to base my work on whether it is legal or not
2989091 im looking forward to the state board taking this up and resolving it once and for all
2989092 they the vendors got smart this year they stopped carrying anime and manga and instead theyre selling shit
2989093 the simple way to avoid the freelance feast or famine cycle
2989094 dreams require goals goals require strategies strategies require tactics and tactics require individual actions many freelance writers cant get past the tasks of today to establish the goals of tomorrow so when the lean times hit theyre totally unprepared plan your writing business to maximize growth opportunities and to be ready for the lean times
2989095 when the story is published you socially bookmark the story as appropriate you send the link to bloggers you know who might be interested you e mail the link to sources or readers you know would be interested after the story is published you follow and participate as appropriate in the online conversation either via comments on the story or on other sites blogs and forums you take everything youve learned and repurpose the story for print
2989096 this case carries inevitably a prison sentence no doubt about it i am going to grant him bail but it must be on the clear understanding what the sentence will be

2989099 coaching writers editors and writers working together across media platforms
2989100 imagine the act of writing less as a special talent and more as a purposeful craft think of writing as carpentry and this book as your toolbox you can borrow a writing tool at any time and heres another secret unlike hammers chisels and rakes writing tools never have to be returned they can be cleaned sharpened and passed along
2989101 every person is born into life as a blank book and every person leaves life as a full book story is the narrative thread of our experience not what literally happens but what we make out of what happens what we tell each other and what we remember this narrative determines what we do with the time between the opening of the blank page the day we are born and the closing of the book the day we die

2989108 the countrys still pretty divided people may want a divided government they want change but im not sure that the democratic agenda has the support of a majority of americans
2989109 people who write road signs have very little space within which to get their message across they dont have the luxury i would call it a hindrance to jazz up their writing with fancy prose or unnecessary words they have a very short space to write on and the fewer and larger the words on a road sign the more likely drivers are to see the words and process the message its conveying
2989110 when your critic is bigger than your artist you try writing then you read it and beat yourself up it isnt pretty nor is it fun in fact it can be unbelievably miserable and if that critic is loud enough and strong enough you can beat yourself straight into clinical depression when you cant write its not because the well has gone dry which is one of two great fears exacerbated and encouraged by the internal critic that either you never had it or you had it and its gone if you have the right habits the well never goes dry
2989111 some of the funniest stuff ive ever written has been preceded by a voice that said youve gone too far only to reconsider it and leave it in and to think it might have gotten nixed because some asshole deep inside me didnt have the foresight to see a good thing when they were supposed to
2989112 you are the boss of your own story not the other writers in your critique group not the famous author whose workshop you were lucky enough to get into at the iowa summer writing festival not even your mother in law who comes into your house while you are at work and vacuums the mattresses because someone has to protect her grandchildren from dust mites when it comes to applying feedback you and only you are the one who gets to determine what stays and what goes in your story and that is a good thing

2989119 i am aware of this positive dope test all i know is that it was an out of competition test that took place some time last week
2989120 its good to get the second race out of the way it was a much more competitive race
2989121 hacker is looking in good form which he hasnt had since 06 but all the times are close its going to be a pretty tight final
2989122 you need to be smart about getting to the final and having fresher legs may help me in that semifinal thats going to be the crucial race
2989123 i wouldnt say i was completely happy with that race but you take a hell of a lot more from those kind of races than if i was leading frida comfortably
2989124 it was perfect it was the ideal race ive been looking forward for these olympics for so long
2989125 the review process demonstrated there was broad support for a reduction in the number of teams in the air new zealand cup
2989126 however the hard part of that decision is having to consider which teams would not be included in the competition
2989127 we have had our financial issues but that doesnt make it any easier its not a palatable decision thats for sure
2989128 that cost us 2 5 million and we are one of the only unions in the country that owns its own ground so most dont have to worry about those sort of costs
2989129 for the last two years weve finished in the first 10 so i dont think anyone could reasonably say that our playing performance has been inhibited
2989130 its hard when everyone says i should be kicking and the coaches game plan is just letting dan kick
2989131 im working on it im practicing my kicking personally i just have to apply it to the game really its like anything when you are trying to add a lot of strings to your game eventually you just have to do it in the game
2989132 i hear a lot of stuff out there its really hard to take at times
2989133 we dont really get that time and space in dunedin we didnt get any lineouts to work off and they are physical at the breakdown someone like schalk burger fires up out of the line and tries to smash everyone its hard
2989134 we just have to adapt to what is going to happen we arent always going to get clean ball and good lineouts so we have to find a way to look for other stuff as well
2989135 but their line speed is pretty you can see how butch james defends and hes a good tackler
2989136 we have just got to look after our ball that is going to be crucial
2989137 they always try to pinpoint who is the best ball runner in the opposition and try and flog them they try to get them mentally as well as physically
2989138 i dropped a few balls in sydney there were a few errors in sydney as a team i had to lift my game in auckland for the team and the coaches really i was pretty stoked that i didnt make a mistake or drop a ball
2989139 i was really concentrating its about doing one job at a time rather than thinking about making a break or making a gap for someone
2989140 the empty seats are a challenge for us and we are trying to manage that
2989141 quite a lot of tickets are taken up by sponsors and journalists with the former giving tickets to their subordinates and friends
2989142 i was very very surprised for what is something thats sold out
2989143 the only explanation i can offer is large corporate purchases we do know that corporates attend sports at their whim and they often have multi tickets and make their choice
2989144 i can only speculate if its to look good or the security

2989477 despite having recent seizures more than one out of three adults reported not seeing a neurologist or epilepsy specialist in the past year
2989478 these findings suggest that adults with uncontrolled seizures may not be receiving the optimal medical treatment they need and may face substantial impairments in their daily activities
2989479 while epilepsy is one of the most common neurological conditions most people know very little about this disorder or how to support those with epilepsy
2989480 we hope this report which provides the largest and most comprehensive data on epilepsy in the united states can help states and public health agencies better understand the prevalence of epilepsy as well as epilepsy associated conditions and limitations
2989481 ayerumes dishonesty showed a reckless disregard for patient safety her actions reflect a serious departure from the standards expected of a nurse as set out in the code of conduct the code states that a nurse must act to identify and minimise risk to patients and that a nurse must be trustworthy at all times and act in a way that justifies the trust and confidence the public have in you by not informing either hospital of her employment status the panel were satisfied that her behaviour constituted misconduct that is fundamentally incompatible with her remaining on the register

2989485 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2989486 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2989487 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2989488 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2989489 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2989490 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2989491 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2989492 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2989552 rusia vrea sa demonstreze prin conflictul din osetia de sud ca georgia nu este o alternativa serioasa pentru tranzitul de hidrocarburi asupra caruia moscova aspira sa detina monopolul
2989553 nu este poate controlul direct al regiunii dar in orice caz moscova vrea sa demonstreze ca aceasta regiune este in continuare instabila si deci nu poate fi o alternativa serioasa pentru tranzitul de hidrocarburi asupra caruia rusia pretinde in prezent ca detine monopolul
2989554 inainte de toate exista un interes vital al occidentului cea mai mare amenintare la adresa europei este monopolul rus asupra rutelor de transport energetic din fosta uniune sovietica catre vest daca georgia este infrinta sperantele europei la independenta energetica fata de rusia vor fi si ele spulberate

2989557 as a former trial lawyer and a former official in the department of justice i do not think as the case presently stands it would have convinced a jury beyond a reasonable doubt

2989637 we are nearer st edmund campion than when i wrote of him we have seen the church drawn underground in country after country in fragments and whispers we get news of other saints in the prison camps of eastern and southeastern europe of cruelty and degradation more savage than anything in tudor england of the same pure light shining in darkness uncomprehended the haunted trapped murdered priest is our contemporary and campions voice sounds to us across the centuries as though he were walking at our elbow

2989640 we have a world class venue with the potential for an excellent facility for elite and community use post games
2989641 it is testament to the hard work of everyone in involved that we have been able to confirm an alternative venue for the mountain biking competition only seven months after the venue change was announced
2989642 we are delighted that such a stunning alternative venue has been found to host mountain biking for the london 2012 games
2989643 with an approximate journey time of 45 minutes to hadleigh farm from the olympic park the proximity to the olympic village will be of immense value to the mountain biking competitors
2989644 the potential for retaining a mountain biking course at hadleigh farm is very exciting as the sport is becoming increasingly popular in the uk and we want to build participation through the undoubted surge in interest in the run up to and after the london 2012 games
2989645 holy cow how in the world did you find yourself standing behind lance armstong
2989646 i had done some minor investigative stuff earlier but i managed to really make my mark with the 2004 election
2989647 my reporting took off based on my skill set with database research thats what was called upon to analyze computer records in the election
2989648 eventually people began to find me and send confidential information
2989649 they trusted me to tell the story better than professional journalists the stuff i had dug up went into the trial about the election
2989650 i think sound politics has a diversity of opinion that you dont get from many newspapers
2989651 i have a blend of original reporting commentary and snark were a loosely based collective everyone has his or her own style and interests id say thats partly why were successful
2989652 i spent a lot of time blogging but it was time to move on
2989653 the opportunity costs were too great i needed to earn a living
2989654 even though this is a left of center area in politics overall there certainly is a market for a more conservative point of view
2989655 i believe our regular readership extends well outside of seattle encompassing the broader puget sound area and to some degree the whole state moreover quality and or entertaining writing seems to have its own draw
2989656 when i started out in 2004 i couldnt get a party official to return my call now theyre inviting me to the dncc
2989657 im simply a damn good read something even many of my righty critics will admit
2989658 ha is the only local liberal blog thats built on muckraking ive always been the go to blogger for dishing the dirt people like dirt
2989659 i want to have fun with politics yet i also want to get stuff done
2989660 i want to be edgy outspoken and occasionally foul mouthed and yet i want to maintain my credibility with stuffy politicos and even stuffier editorial boards sometimes wonkish sometimes satirical but always truthful ha is an opportunity to speak my mind while enjoying the delusion that others actually care what i have to say it is pure unadulterated me
2989661 one of the comments i occasionally get is something along the lines that profanity is a last resort of people who are otherwise incapable of expressing themselves which is of course a load of shit
2989662 in fact this critique itself is nothing more than a crutch for those who cant refute me theyre essentially saying look see goldy curses so you can dismiss everything he said thats just lazy rhetoric on their part these are words powerful words and like all my words i choose them very carefully im a writer
2989663 i was happy to play my part once cast in it
2989664 you know reporters if theres a conservative blogger there has to be a liberal blogger to balance him out and because the capital press corps was already familiar with me i was the obvious choice stefan also stupidly got into a pissing match with me again upping my profile and increasing my traffic so i thank him
2989665 i wouldnt say goldstein and i are buddies either but weve had pleasant conversations together i even went to
2989666 i know there are folks at the times who think i have a chip on my shoulder but if i do it is because i resent the fact that they so blithely dismiss me when i am at least as good a writer and political analyst as any columnist or editorialist on their staff
2989667 perhaps instead of bemoaning the changing media environment and blaming the internet for undermining their business model they should re examine the quality of their own content and consider the possibility that they might stem the steady decline in their readership if only they offered a more compelling product
2989668 as soon as lezak came off that last wall i started going crazy were a team we went in as a team and now were exiting as a team and were going out with that gold that we needed to get back
2989669 ive been on the last two relays where we come up short
2989670 to be honest with you i got really tired of losing i finished real strong
2989671 i just got to go home and take care of myself its going to be a tight final
2989672 natalies just so good at racing and planning out her races so i just expect nothing but fast fast swimming tomorrow morning
2989673 i wanted to go 1 45 and if it werent for that messed up finish i would have done it
2989674 i just wanted to save as much energy as possible for the relay
2989675 it had to be the best ever and it was the best ever
2989676 thats the kind of anchor you dream of when you put the world record holder in on the end of a relay and you go into the pool behind him the chance of you beating him is slim and none theres never been a 50 meters like that in my memory not running down somebody that holds a world record and thats on their game that was incredible
2989677 i could see on his face the pain of losing something like that
2989678 i was just thinking to myself if theres anyone on this team or in the world that is going to do it it was going to be jason
2989679 weve had teams from many different countries take part teams from canada japan individuals from thailand malaysia singapore taiwan china hong kong india weve been slowly building that
2989680 what we havent managed to significantly do yet is to open up the european opportunity and thats something we need to address
2989681 it certainly does have an impact thats great but i think weve some way to go to attract even more talented applicants to the programme and particularly there are some general computer arts and sciences programmes where people arent necessarily so focused on games as a career that wed like to attract to come and experience being part of a team too
2989682 so while weve had some success weve still got quite a way to go before being looked at as always having the cream of the crop taking part in dare
2989683 theres no doubt that the recognition around the skillset accreditation and the paucity of skillset accredited courses and the fact that were the only university that has the arts and programming courses accredited those things have been extremely positive for abertay
2989684 but theyre the result of a long hard slog and we see ourselves only as a little way down the road yet because weve got to do quite a lot more to do what the industry wants and there are some pretty tough challenges skills wise ahead
2989685 its a tossup whether i check gamesindustry biz or make my morning coffee first as both are essential to my early morning routine i find gamesindustry biz a key component of my research with the sites editors and reporters breaking news stories more often than any of its competitors
2989686 we zijn gewend aan fascistische regimes die de vrijheid van meningsuiting niet tolereren veel andere kleinere landen met dictators hebben ook al besloten ons te blokkeren omdat we meewerken aan de verspreiding van schadelijke informatie over die dictators ditmaal is het itali ze hebben last van hun verleden omdat een deel van de ifpi de wereldwijde belangenvereniging voor platenmaatschappijen red tijdens het fascisme in itali is opgericht en nu hebben ze een fascistische leider silvio berlusconi

2989722 a lot of european culture has been allowed to creep into christianity
2989723 we africans must be able to differentiate between a bible doctrine and european culture of one man one wife
2989724 i wish to reiterate our well known position based on the holy bible that women should not be ordained as priests
2989725 it is instructive that there is opposition from significant sections of the anglican communion such that up to
2989726 it is noteworthy that leaders of the anglican church in england have failed to discipline churches that have openly consecrated gay bishops and blessed same sex marriages
2989727 their failure to act is nothing but a clear endorsement of homosexuality it is the duty of religious leaders to direct their flock to do what is right not follow prevailing winds homosexuals and lesbians should be counselled with the words of the scriptures and prayed for so that they may change their ways to meet the lords requirement jesus christ stated that he came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance
2989728 its unfair to the people of the country who had so much confidence that hard work as exhibited by a man like ribadu pays its unfair to nigeria as a nation and its unfair to ribadu who really was committed to his enviable position as efcc chairman and gave it his best
2989729 government should reconsider this decision something can still be done to remedy the situation because it is not fair is it not government that promoted him is government not a continuous process you promoted a man due to his brilliant performance and now you said you have demoted him something does not seem right about it because the government promoted him in the first instance he did not promote himself that action could be remedied
2989730 i thought if he is fairly promoted by the former leadership then he is unfairly treated and this demotion has a long time implication
2989731 if a man can perform so brilliantly outside his professional career and could do what ribadu did with efcc then it does not seem fair and it also raises a question because the impression is that he is being punished for something he did or failed to do the whole things seems political and that should be a lesson for all nigerians above all it teaches those of us in positions of authority to be careful because nigeria is a big theatre of the absurd and one has to be careful about how one does certain national assignments given to him because things can really get awry at the end
2989732 ribadu was promoted because he was on special assignment at the efcc and his job as the efcc chairman required a high rank it was his time and he got it demoting him is a dis service to the country to the people of nigeria and to the man himself it is not fair he should have his rank back and i am saying this sincerely because it is the proper thing to be done
2989733 it is difficult to believe that due process was not followed i dont think the country was fair to him in his assignment one can be promoted for exceptional performance and brilliance nuhu ribadu performed exceptionally during his tenure as efcc chairman and deserved his promotion you cannot fault that i dont believe in this due process thing the present igp was promoted two steps are they not in the same country we have also seen the igp promote officers on the spot for good performance is ribadus own going to be different and as if that was not enough he is going to pass through another humiliation of being sent packing from the course he has already done half way my appeal to ribadu is to take it easy the whole world can rate him and the whole world knows and acknowledges his brilliant performance the world should not hold it against him because the people of nigeria appreciate him and what he did for the country so nobody should sell us that dummy about due process because there have been instances of people who are promoted two three steps for exceptional brilliant performances and such promotions are common in the forces so i am appealing to president yaradua and the police service commission to reconsider what it has decided concerning this matter it is not fair
2989734 for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast
2989735 behold satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat but i have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren
2989736 as you pastor this one church talking about our church in lagos the world will become your parish for i have ordained you to serve your generation
2989737 so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god
2989738 study to shew thyself approved unto god a workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth
2989739 lord jesus christ i come to you today i am a sinner forgive me my sins today lord jesus christ i accept you as my lord and saviour thank you jesus for saving me now i know i am born again
2989740 worthy of commendation is the courage of pdp leadership of ogbulafor in reversing obasanjos personalization of the pdp
2989741 this particular decision of the pdp nec will go a long way to tell future leaders of this nation that no matter how powerful you think you are you can only last there for a short period and turn yourself into a laughing stock
2989742 when obasanjo came on board no president enjoyed the type of good will that he enjoyed
2989743 pdp constitution and guidelines were even changed to allow him run for president when he was not qualified to do so obasanjo came with vengeance on the entire nation
2989744 he chased those who formed the party away deregistered founding members of the party hunted those that put him in power and put many of them in jail
2989745 he put so much energy in dividing the north destroyed the south west political leadership destabilized the south east and imposed new leaders there
2989746 what is more he moved to make himself life president by attempting to change the constitution of the nation
2989747 most of all obasanjo who had only n20 000 when he came out of prison is today ranked as africa s richest man alive
2989748 he created cronies and amassed unprecedented wealth while shouting anti corruption
2989749 the pdp must do more by recovering some money from obasanjo just like he did to the abacha family
2989750 what abacha took is a childs play compared to obasanjos the efcc must change their strategy and recover our money from obasanjo that way nigerians would be happy with government
2989751 we are particularly happy with mr president for his commitment to rule of law but he must take a decisive step to address south east short changing in the scheme of things
2989752 indeed must be sustained so that together we can put religious conflicts in this country in the museum
2989753 the message in this similitude is clear our level of godliness will be determined to the extent by which our actions impact positively on the lives of our compatriots and humanity in general
2989754 islam or christianity will be our faith truth justice and fair play will be our religion national development based on human development will be our passion
2989755 we need the full support and co operation of the political leadership good governance remains the most effective promoter of peace harmony and mutual co existence
2989756 we must work together in peace and harmony to banish poverty from the land and ensure every citizen leads a decent and productive life
2989757 im going no where why are you deporting me im very sick and infested with hiv you infested me and now you want to deport me i was pregnant and lost the baby my fallopian tube has been removed
2989758 in our view this mayimply a lack of confidence by this senior employee related to the funds where profit sharing was given up
2989759 we cant rule out additional dilutive share grants to other senior employees down the road
2989760 motorola is not yet out of the woods but these are encouraging early signs of stabilization

2989764 la examinaron el 31 de julio en la villa ol mpica por la tarde y sali de china esa misma noche antes de conocer el resultado es la primera infracci n del programa antidopaje de los juegos que empez el 27 de julio se trata de un positivo por epo
2989765 no haya entendido el mensaje de tolerancia cero y que no hay escapatoria

2989767 le pido por favor mir ndola a los ojos que diga qui n se la ha dado la epo porque vamos a ir a por esa persona este da o esta irresponsabilidad se puede rebajar si se dan nombres

2989770 lets take the example of a power plant where the government as a grantor allows the private party to set up a power plant and sell the power generated back to the government under indian gaap the operator which is the private sector company would show that as a fixed asset on the books and would show the sale of the power as a sale under ifric 12 that would not be the case under ifric 12 as the asset is controlled by the government the infrastructure asset would go off from the books of the private sector the private sector would be shown as providing two services the construction of the power plant and second rendering of the operating facilities
2989771 so in the book of the private sector it would be shown maybe as an intangible if he has the right to sell it to the private sector as well or maybe as a recievable
2989772 could very well disregard or do away with the action of the departments bureaus or offices even in the exercise of discretionary authority
2989773 by its own action petitioner citinickel accomplished the very evil sought to be avoided by the rules against forum shopping and thus cannot be permitted to profit from its wrongdoing
2989774 it is in progress and hopefully before the year ends we will launch it for now we own 100 percent of the venture
2989775 as far as i was able to see in shariff aguak particularly in my precinct voting was very fast and very smooth
2989776 what i saw was not just encouraging there was enthusiasm among the voters in the automation of the armm elections voting was fast
2989777 with dre the entire process is fast and the results come out fast too so the losers will feel less pain as they await the results kaunting aray na lang only a slight pain for the losers
2989778 this is an encouraging development as we welcome the coming of the countrys modernization of the political exercise
2989779 we are always looking at humanitarian disaster everytime huge numbers of people are driven from their homes
2989780 the current situation on the ground is very fluid and very volatile

2989796 i saw him through the office window and went out i pointed out there werent any double yellows there he said somebody would be coming along to paint them back and he basically accused me of being the one who had painted them out then he just gave me the ticket anyway
2989797 i had done no such thing to be honest i thought the council had done it because i dont think it is council land
2989798 ive heard of other people in our building who say theyve had tickets for parking in that space which were quashed because its not council land
2989799 it is apparent that a small section of double yellow lines on tivoli st have been deliberately obscured with a view to avoiding the obvious parking restrictions in place
2989800 if a motorist in receipt of a parking ticket considers that it should not be paid they should appeal following the instructions on the reverse of the parking ticket
2989801 it is a private street but we have been asked by the landlord to enforce parking regulations
2989802 las tropas georgianas han reanudado sus bombardeos masivos con diferentes tipos de armas entre ellas artiller a pesada contra localidades de osetia del sur

2989804 quiero decir el traslado por parte de estados unidos de un contingente georgiano en irak con aviones de transporte militar pr cticamente hasta la zona de conflicto
2989805 la escala de este cinismo es pasmosa el intento de convertir el blanco en negro el negro en blanco y de diestramente retratar a las v ctimas de la agresi n como agresores y poner la responsabilidad de las consecuencias de la agresi n en las v ctimas

2989813 when it comes to the challenges of ownership i think that decentralization of ec aid is an important factor decentralization to the delegations so that the dialogue can take place on a level where the partnership is taking place and that goes for all the member states but certainly for the governments and the civil society and that is something for what we have to work stronger for the decentralization of the delegations

2989849 he made it through this much of camp without spasms which he hasnt in the past
2989850 it usually happens sooner than this if im looking for a positive in the situation that would be the positive
2989851 thomas back spasms gives him a chance to work out there and hes pretty good at it and were going to keep bringing king dunlap the eagles seventh round pick along he played well the other night hes been working his tail off
