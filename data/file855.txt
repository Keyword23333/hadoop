8550004 everyone was asking me before what it was going to be like i was like i dont know i havent talked to her in 10 or 15 years

8550181 the trend now for adults is for less body hair and that is being passed down to younger age groups

8550224 there is a large social connection of dog owners who live within a few blocks and we visit during peak dog walking hours
8550225 we have had social gatherings and everyone keeps each other informed of neighbourhood happenings
8550226 they roll around on the floor with their mouths tangled and feet in the air
8550227 what prosecutors oftentimes want is an admission on the part of the public official and resignation
8550228 its a significant bargaining chip that he has if hes already removed from office then that certainly could have a possible impact on the plea negotiations
8550229 if he wants to leave the criminal cases he is going to need to do it before the removal is resolved
8550230 or you take your chances by going through the removal proceedings you fight that fight and see what happens
8550231 there are public officials who survive these trials and continue in office
8550232 there also are public officials who fight their cases get convicted and serve more time in jail than they would have if they had pleaded guilty or resigned
8550233 the governor is the sole tribunal in removal proceedings with no right of appeal or review afforded the accused
8550234 if the governor acts within the law the governors decision is final
8550235 but i dont believe the question about an appeal has ever been raised
8550236 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
8550237 this suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents which berries provide may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes
8550238 freeze drying the berries concentrates these elements about ten times giving us a power pack of chemoprevention agents that can influence the different signaling pathways that are deregulated in cancer
8550239 these changes in gene expression correlated with changes in the tissue that included greater cell proliferation marked inflammation and increased apoptosis
8550240 because both berries and the second agent maintain near normal levels of expression of these 53 genes we believe their early deregulation may be especially important in the development of esophageal cancer
8550241 previously addiction to benzodiazepines has been explained by reference to negative rather than positive reinforcement in other words the thinking has been that the reason people continue to use the medicine is that it helps to alleviate their distressing withdrawal symptoms and general discomfort rather than because it provides a sense of reward
8550242 patients who used statins before an ami and continued to take them after were 16 less likely to die over the next year than those who never used them so even if it appears that the statins failed to prevent your ami it is beneficial to continue taking them and potentially quite harmful to stop
8550243 in the general population the statin discontinuation rate within the first year of prescription is 30 percent thats very high
8550244 because statins are preventative drugs patients may not feel the immediate benefit of taking them and sometimes stop however it looks like this might be quite a dangerous practice after an ami
8550245 the mean brain volume in preterm infants with abnormal blood flow distribution was 45 millilitres smaller than in other preterm infants
8550246 we examined tissue samples from preterm placentas and classified them according to the amount of inflammation found in microscopic examinations inflammatory reactions were seen in 45 per cent of the placentas
8550247 a genotype causing strong inflammatory response increases the risk of placental inflammation but on the other hand protects the child against inflammation our preliminary findings suggest that genetic regulation of interleukin 6 is also associated with the volume of the deep gray matter of the brain

8550285 the past one and half years of yaraduas presidency were marred by indolence ineptitude violence kidnapping armed robbery communal clashes power blackout and succumbing to the whims and caprices of a cabal holding the nation to ransom
8550286 yaradua is the de facto and de jure head of the country we shall never associate the government and people of zamfara state with any attempt to run him down the disrespectful write up sought to condemn the administration of president yaradua and by extension our growing democracy
8550287 yaradua is the pillar behind the democratic dividends being enjoyed by nigerians nationwide as he promptly releases allocations to all tiers of government
8550288 this belies the claim by the cross river state government in the past that bakassi was part of the state bakassi was never part of cross river state
8550289 i say this because when you are internally displaced you go to the nearest place where your next and nearest kins are

8550325 kraken en geweld gingen vroeger al hand in hand nu oost europese criminelen ook al meedoen is het de hoogste tijd voor een algemeen kraakverbod

8550360 we are giving our children the polluted floodwater to drink there is no other option
8550361 we have nothing left there is no food we dont even have plastic sheets or kerosene
8550362 no relief has reached us we are surviving on stale rice and flood water
8550363 it is not an easy task given the availability of boats helicopters and officials engaged in the rescue work
8550364 our aid diplomacy is aimed at gaining more influence in the ior and coupled with our look east policy it is expected to help india gain in the region
8550365 we are helping african countries and countries like mauritius in capacity building and capability enhancing we would like to play a benevolent role in this area
8550366 the fact that india could deploy its navy within 24 hours of the tsunami created ripples in the world including in washington
8550367 post tsunami we have learnt more lessons in relief operations each of our ships carries one logistic brick a pre packed container of emergency supplies which is sufficient to cater to 200 people for 30 days the brick includes a community kitchen and packaged food to provide immediate relief and succour
8550368 traditionally aid is a potent tool of diplomacy with a number of natural disasters hitting the indian ocean region the indian navy has acquired a great edge
8550369 moreover engaging in capacity building and capability enhancing is the direct way of enhancing influence
8550370 indias move should be seen in the light of chinas interest in the region and the aid it has been showering on the nations to avoid a choking of its energy supplies

8550387 kita lihat penerimaan yang berkurang itu dikurangi subsidi hasilnya masih aman atau tidak menurut saya seharusnya aman asalkan volume bbm tidak diganggu kalau harga minyak aman tapi volume naik itu gawat begitu juga sebaliknya jadi yang perlu dikontrol adalah volume
8550388 ternyata volume konsumsi bbm bersubsidi naik angka lifting justru turun padahal harga tak berpengaruh signifikan jadi yang terpenting sebenarnya adalah volume konsumsi

8550391 the toxic combination of bad policies economics and politics is in large measure responsible for the fact that a majority of people in the world do not enjoy the good health that is biologically possible
8550392 there are examples where health inequalities have narrowed but in too many cases we have seen a widening
8550393 but that means the magnitude of inequalities is flexible if the gap can widen it can get narrower
8550394 in the uk we have seen an improvement in peoples health over the last eight years
8550395 the key message of our report is that the circumstances in which people are born grow live work and age are the fundamental drivers of health and health inequity
8550396 we rely too much on medical interventions as a way of increasing life expectancy
8550397 a more effective way of increasing life expectancy and improving health would be for every government policy and programme to be assessed for its impact on health and health equity to make health and health equity a marker for government performance

8550490 it is also the moment when countries are required to set out where they stand on the significant issues of nationhood and international law
8550491 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war we dont want one he has a big responsibility not to start one
8550492 that means bolstering our allies rebalancing the energy relationship with russia defending the rules of international institutions and renewing efforts to tackle unresolved conflicts
8550493 second we must rebalance the energy relationship between russia and europe
8550494 the crisis in georgia has been a rude awakening for the world
8550495 they have seen russia invade a neighbour blockade its ports blow up bridges and other vital infrastructure forcing tens of thousands of terrified civilians to flee
8550496 despite agreeing a ceasefire and to withdraw its troops russian forces remain in georgia far beyond the areas where there was original tension they must leave as they promised

8550504 musk ox come and go every so often and were fortunate that they were able to leave us alone as we leave them alone but this one just so happened to have a mind of its own and it was crazy

8550506 he went down again but then he just came right back up looked at me and then went after me
8550507 i only had enough time to point the rifle really quick at him and get off another shot and then ran toward the house from there even after that third shot on him he continued right at me
8550508 he seemed to look like hes going to pull through
8550509 im going to have to keep my hopes up that hell be able to go out and race again but the most fortunate thing is im able to keep him alive
8550510 weve actually had dogs that were actually killed by musk ox individuals who were charged by them while they were berry picking
8550511 this is just not the time of year to be out and about due to the rut and everything of that nature
8550512 battles between bull musk oxen during the rut are spectacular and violent contests
8550513 maybe they want to tussle with something and dogs are if theres no other bull there maybe dogs will suffice for now
8550514 but from what ive heard its not so much that theyre out cruising and looking for a fight its just that theyre pretty unresponsive to things that would normally scare them
8550515 if i was behind and losing the election of course there would be no fundraisers
8550516 but the reality is were ahead and we expect to be ahead when the absentee votes are done
8550517 im excited that we have a 152 vote spread and weve got thousands of absentee ballots yet to count
8550518 were just going to have to patiently wait and see what happens
8550519 theres no way a campaign at this point can just stop and lose those two weeks

8550527 im six weeks into it and its really coming on ive got good movement in it and overall its very positive
8550528 although weve signed a lot of players this summer weve still got only a 21 man squad really and well lose a lot of that to the internationals next week
8550529 the defeat did highlight that we need a lot more strength in depth and hopefully that will come before september 1
8550530 for a young guy he appears to be older than he is because he is very driven and is pretty reserved
8550531 he is now doing a lot of things i was asking him to like being much more aggressive and stop hitting so many damn drop shots stop playing what i call possum tennis
8550532 he likes to get on the ropes but he is the kind of fighter who has the capability to get into the centre of the ring and throw blows if he plays more like that then great things are going to happen because he has great talent
8550533 i got sacked i got a call from the lta to say he wanted to go in another direction

8550608 antioxidants sit within this tiny trojan horse protecting it from attack from digestive juices in the stomach
8550609 once in the small intestine the nanoparticle gets sticky and bonds to the intestinal wall it then leaks its contents directly into the intestinal cells which allows them to be absorbed directly into the blood stream
8550610 we hope that by mastering this technique drugs and supplements also vulnerable to the digestive process can be better absorbed by the human body
8550611 for catechins the class of antioxidants under examination and among the most potent dietary antioxidants only between 0 1 and 1 1 per cent of the amount consumed makes it into our blood if we can improve that rate the benefits are enormous
8550612 many studies have noted the fact that rls has a far reaching symptom spectrum that can severely impact and limit several aspects of everyday life the pramipexole clinical trials reinforce the need for a simple effective treatment for people with rls to address these symptoms including limb pain and associated mood disorder in addition to the characteristic rls symptoms these important new findings reaffirm pramipexole as an effective pharmacological regimen for the treatment of rls the studies have proven that pramipexole can offer patient specific benefits which combined can lead to significant improvement of patients overall quality of life
8550613 roommate relationships can be really good or they can be really bad and the fear is that theyll go from bad to worse
8550614 but our study shows that you can create a supportive relationship and turn the stranger whos your roommate into a friend
8550615 basically people who give support in response to another persons needs and out of concern for another persons welfare are most successful at building close relationships that they find supportive
8550616 the transition from high school to college is challenging for a variety of reasons
8550617 the academic environment is usually more difficult and more competitive and moving away from the nuclear family for the first time disrupts established social support networks

8550619 this study not only describes the mechanism of cyclosporine in the kidney
8550620 it also sheds light on the pathogenesis of proteinuric diseases in general suggesting that the immune system is much less important for this type of disease than anticipated

8550622 working in a team effort to turn our research into practical applications that benefit patients
8550623 this study revealed a consistent 20 per cent increase in the risk of type 1 diabetes
8550624 type 1 diabetes occurs when the immune system destroys the insulin producing cells in the pancreas and one theory suggests that being born by caesarean section may affect the development of the immune system because babies are first exposed to bacteria originating from the hospital environment rather than to maternal bacteria
8550625 the study findings are interesting but unless a biological mechanism is established it would be unwise to read too much into this association between caesarean section delivery and diabetes
8550626 fortunately figures from the northern ireland type 1 diabetes register indicate that only around two per 1 000 children will develop diabetes by their 15th birthday so a 20 per cent increase is on quite a low baseline risk
8550627 not all women have the choice of whether to have a caesarean section or not but those who do may wish to take this risk into consideration before choosing to give birth this way
8550628 we already know that genetics and childhood infections play a vital role in the development of type 1 diabetes in children but the findings of this study indicate that the way a baby is delivered could affect how likely it is to develop this condition later in life diabetes uk northern ireland would welcome more research in this area

8550634 16 years ago you gave me the profound honor to lead our party to victory and to lead our nation to a new era of peace and broadly shared prosperity together we prevailed in a hard campaign in which republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8550635 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it will not work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history

8550653 join in the effort to take america back from the republicans
8550654 rocked the house and added that bill clinton who blessed obamas candidacy last night reminded americans of a time when a president actually put people first
8550655 it took someone to be classy and who cares about this country to pull it together for one america she said
8550656 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama clinton said
8550657 actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8550658 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world clinton said
8550659 he is ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states
8550660 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8550661 most important barack obama knows that america cannot be strong abroad unless we are strong at home he said
8550662 we think we have a real good team this year and were going to surprise some people
8550663 when i led the louisiana community and technical college system we looked to college of the mainland to learn from you about what youre doing with process technology
8550664 will hold and test 100 per cent of the product coming off the lines for four to six weeks
8550665 having been subjected to three or four complete chemical wash downs theres very little doubt that theres any listeria there left
8550666 of course it can come back at a moments notice on someones shoes on someones hand it can be brought back into the plant the day after we say everything is good
8550667 thats not true about 50 per cent of an inspectors time is on the floor of the plant the other 50 per cent is overseeing paperwork most of its scientific in nature test results
8550668 the review of results from testing the review of records the review of the cooking temperatures employed in a plant in my view are fundamental to demonstrating that the processes being employed by the plant are in control
8550669 that scientific review demonstrates the safety and security of the entire process used to produce a food
8550670 while this is the most unfortunate of events possible i absolutely do not believe that this is a failure of the canadian food safety system or the regulators certainly knowing that there is a desire to assign blame i want to reiterate that the buck stops right here
8550671 if you had a box of cereal and you took one tablespoon of cereal out of that box you would more than likely get a negative result even though a bacteria may exist at the bottom of the box
8550672 its like looking for a needle in a hay stack
8550673 but there are no regulations its important to stress that they the companies are regulated to ensure that listeria is not present in the product but its up to the producer to devise a sampling plan that they think would meet the government regulation
8550674 we have increased the number of regulators but we also do rely on the companies themselves it has to be a joint effort there has to be a shared responsibility
8550675 we can confirm that fairfax newspapers will be published tomorrow as normal a spokeswoman for fairfax in sydney said this afternoon
8550676 the anger of the staff at the way the company has treated them
8550677 this was a motion that arose spontaneously from the floor of the meeting because people are angry at the way the company has treated them both in terms of enterprise agreement negotiations and also the redundancy announcements mr bachelard said
8550678 this would be the end of fairfax as we know it
8550679 its not possible to continue to produce the level of quality journalism fairfax is known for with 550 fewer staff
8550680 were determined to use every option we have to stop the company from screwing the business that some of these people have been worked 20 or 30 years for
8550681 one comment from the meeting was that journalists decisively felt they wanted to take a stand he said
8550682 well make the same demands we have from the beginning that the company negotiates with us on enterprise agreements and to have the guts to inform us properly about the cuts
8550683 people are worried about their futures and if they are going to have a job in a few weeks time mr dobbie said
8550684 so far the company has refused to meet with the members who are also angry management has been stalling on enterprise bargain agreement negotiations
8550685 they wanted to signal to management they want to be involved and negotiated with and consulted by the company as to what plans management has for fairfax media rather than be treated dismissively and communicated to by email
8550686 they believe the new management team that has come in since the merger with rural press is all about low cost and low quality journalism which isnt good for anyone
8550687 its not good for the paper not good for the journalists and not good for the communities they serve
8550688 were probably a day or two away from being very confident about where it will land

8550706 this is the first ever case in indonesias political history where a high ranked former military general former deputy head of the intelligence agency was brought to trial
8550707 i think we all welcome the current legal proceedings on muchdi
8550708 it needs more action from the government from the law enforcement agencies to make sure that muchdis trial is a symbol of a whole change in indonesia
8550709 since the beginning we have demanded that law enforcement agents bring to trial all the people who were involved in the case and i think that one of the most important people who needs to be brought to trial is former chief of the intelligence agency abdullah mahmud hendropriyono
8550710 unfortunately until now we havent seen or havent heard that he has been under investigation by the police
8550711 circumstantial evidence that has appeared in the court proceedings of the former director of garuda and the former pilot of garuda points strongly to the involvement of high ranking officials not only muchdi but also the other deputies who were involved in the planning of the murder
8550712 the current proceedings can also bring more progress for future investigations
8550713 i think it has been experienced in the case of pollycarpus where we were able to collaborate further evidence further information about the involvement of the former director of garuda indra setiawan

8550749 does a mass transit system that passes through crime ridden inner city areas help transport crime to the suburbs is such a line expanding the range of action of potential criminals by facilitating their journeys to crime

8550777 right from day one mores strategy has been to include a leading technical platform in its nordic group we aim to be number one in the nordic region because well be running several projects in different countries we need a technical platform with high expertise and reliability weve found this in add2phone
8550778 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8550779 we need to wait a few more years before we can say definitely that things are getting worse but there does seem to be a growing problem in some areas we are seeing parts of the outlying regions being affected rather than just urban areas
8550780 in the outlying areas health services are maybe less available in a city the services are better such as local access to gps theres also a certain amount of social stigma attached to being obese it may be that these obese people are not going to see their gp however we need to bear in mind that some pcts are better at recording the data than others which could affect the results
8550781 anoles are highly visual species so in that sense its not surprising that they would use visual displays to mark territory still the finding is surprising because these are the first animals known to use non acoustic signalling at dawn and dusk
8550782 these patterns have remarkable parallels with the dawn and dusk choruses reported for many acoustically communicating animals
8550783 the dawn chorus may be a way of communicating having survived the night if in the morning a bird doesnt hear its neighbour or an anole doesnt see its neighbour it may be an opportunity for the animal to expand its territory
8550784 all of these behaviors are displays of physical vigor as in humans if an anole can do many of these push ups it shows that he is in prime physical condition these displays of strength help avert actual physical confrontations between male lizards which can be very fierce and destructive
8550785 the technical committee would have discussions about how to adopt the new playing conditions sent by the international cricket council for international cricket in our domestic cricket
8550786 by knowing this minimum galaxy mass we can better understand how dark matter behaves which is essential to one day learning how our universe and life as we know it came to be
8550787 we are excited because these galaxies are virtually invisible yet contain a tremendous amount of dark matter
8550788 the data show that early treatment can result in a slowing of clinical progression these data are also consistent with an earlier trial with rasagiline which showed a similar outcome
8550789 this may offer real benefit to patients who are treated promptly after diagnosis
8550790 although it is relatively rare to find the eggs and babies of extinct animals it is even rarer to find them inside the body of the mother

8550793 what we have are vgs whose work is only safeguarding wild animals against poachers

8550801 with the players that we had was a bump in the road for us it was big losses but these kids you know a bunch of them have been together for a while and you can call them calabash brothers
8550802 its got to do with education and a lack of staffing and a lack of resources
8550803 we know if residents have more one on one attention we wouldnt need as many sedatives
8550804 its better to manage them through reducing the use of tea and coffee and giving hot milky drinks rather than giving sleeping tablets
8550805 its important to try other strategies rather than move straight on to medications that help people sleep and sedate them

8550810 while we are capable of meeting current demand there is a backlog of high priority patients
8550811 in that context the decision to outsource to an australian hospital with the capacity to perform that surgery within the next three months makes sense
8550812 while we are capable of meeting current demand there is a backlog of high priority patients
8550813 i think in these matters its best to proceed with all due care and deliberation and of course people are always innocent until proven guilty

8550847 since direct sales online and call centre really took off with gusto every year its been growing at the expense of the high street this is the first year the high street has held its own
8550848 if people had negative experiences booking online there is a possibility they have gone back to the high street agents have become more customer centric following investment and training
8550849 there has definitely been a return to traditional high street retailers what we have seen in the last 12 to 18 months is the retail sector maturing in recognition of the fact there are so many other ways to book we have all got smarter in the way we serve customers
8550850 we have had to fine tune our retail estate non productive agencies have closed and we have invested in other units this year we will refurbish about 50 branches

8550864 its not rhetoric but its reality the god we serve is the god of a second chance
8550865 im not sure that i can think of an instance where after something like this the church is as large or as strong as it was before
8550866 sometimes the work goes on but in a much diminished way its been easier for politicians to recover than religious leaders
8550867 praise until something happens you keep on praising you keep on shouting you keep on dancing and see where god is going to take you
8550868 the people that i paid their mortgage people that i paid their rent their electric i counseled them through their divorces and the loss of their children when i needed them they left me

8550890 having a family is not your get out of jail free card
8550891 she was the one who brought the wood into the place and used it
8550892 the events that took place that night were extremely serious
8550893 something to do with furniture and a deceased brother and tensions were very high
8550894 track and field is my job this is what i do i work
8550895 right now im just trying to get my blood pumping pretty much ive been doing a little bit of training
8550896 i know the celebrations will wait until i get home so im not worried
8550897 i am just trying to come here and let the fans enjoy my performance because they come here to see a performance
8550898 he hasnt really had time to get rest and training
8550899 but he is still pretty much in good shape and he will put on a good show tomorrow
8550900 i cant do it on my own personally but the other guys definitely are stepping up i think track and field is getting better
8550901 i saw that i was going to win and i celebrated because i worked hard all year and i got what i wanted
8550902 i think last year they didnt have the points system quite right with guys not being able to move enough la rich beem and this year it seems like the players think its a little too much movement but certainly theyve created some drama some guys are going to be thinking about just making the cut this week guys wouldnt probably be thinking about that normally
8550903 agree to use the service only for purposes that are legal authorized proper
8550904 my leg was straight and i couldnt bend it the muscle was in spasm and i had a lot of pain
8550905 theyre grasping at straws i would think every sponsor would be against this you shouldnt be forcing people like this its not inclusive
8550906 we know on the lpga tour that we are judged by our clothes
8550907 what you wear says a lot about you we all compare notes on what works in clothing there are so many little extra things like brightly coloured caps that we can add for flair and style its not like the mens tour
8550908 in a society when we very rarely let our mobile phones out of our sight its quite amazing to think that for a lot of us the minute we jump in the shower someone might be checking up on us
8550909 with so many modes of communication available these days its difficult to keep track of your partners whereabouts or who theyre chatting to and when
8550910 flirting is age old but the fact that it can now be tracked on your phone makes a nervous partner a paranoid text checker
8550911 if you suspect that your partner is up to something talk about it text checking can turn into a vicious cycle and it can easily be avoided
8550912 thats the whole thing we didnt have many chances its a shame we couldnt get him a run
8550913 he worked ahead he beat hitters up he didnt get predictable he just pitched
8550914 just strike one strike two dont get in their hitters counts
8550915 thats what theyve always told me you can see it works
8550916 it doesnt matter what team it is as long as we keep racking up wins
8550917 it was down and away but leaked back over the plate a little bit
8550918 it rained every day but i got the job done now i feel very confident in trying to win this event
8550919 my goal is to win and try to forget about everything else
8550920 ultimately it came down to the fact that i still enjoy playing and competing
8550921 im ready for the start of camp and am looking forward to the upcoming season
8550922 everybody was starting to worry what joe was going to do
8550923 what he brings to the ice everyone knows joe is joe but what he brings to the locker room the respect everybodys so calm when hes around thats what he brings that people dont see
8550924 i just felt at times i was thinking too much and not having fun playing the game of football and just reacting
8550925 buratto will tell me to take a series or two and im comfortable with that
8550926 the whole game was just putting a lot more on me and taking away from me just being a natural football player
8550927 you have less to think about now you can just concentrate on executing as a player and helping the offence get the ball moving
8550928 with the 20 second clock and kerrys newness to the offence more than anything else and newness to the way things are called hes not exceptionally comfortable with everything as of yet
8550929 as he gets more comfortable hell assume more of those things
8550930 its our performance it has nothing to do with the plays were calling
8550931 every play is designed to go from point a to point b we need to perform better
8550932 we need to perform better regardless of whos calling the plays
8550933 it was a nice house nice house nice house crack house thats where ive got to say
8550934 it had a bed and it was close to the gym and thats what i needed

8550936 the government seems obsessed with fighting a losing battle to artificially prop up the housing market rather than finding ways to deal with its worst effects
8550937 ministers must act to help the thousands of families struggling to keep a roof over their heads
8550938 the government should allow councils and housing associations to buy up land as well as empty homes to help replenish britains much depleted stock of social housing
8550939 ministers must also tighten up repossession rules to ensure that peoples homes are only ever repossessed as a last resort

8550983 bravo did not put up a fight like what he promised in one of his interviews he ran away before our troops entered bilal complex
8550984 its an alarming thing for me i am quite alarmed by the resurgence of such kinds of groups it does not help solve the situation
8550985 i think the policy of having police auxiliaries is sufficient just to protect the communities but the ilaga with their connotation of having some quasi cultural significance in conflict is quite alarming
8550986 its not a question of procuring one more c 130 its just bringing in service some more and within next week or a week or two one will be in service so we have two flying and one more will be in the pipeline

8550991 designating that mood of a verb used to express an act
8550992 the great gospel imperatives to holiness are ever rooted in indicatives of grace that are able to sustain the weight of those imperatives the apostles do not make the mistake thats often made in christian ministry for the apostles the indicatives are more powerful than the imperatives in gospel preaching so often in our preaching our indicatives are not strong enough great enough holy enough or gracious enough to sustain the power of the imperatives and so our teaching on holiness becomes a whip or a rod to beat our peoples backs because weve looked at the new testament and thats all we ourselves have seen weve seen our own failure and weve seen the imperatives to holiness and weve lost sight of the great indicatives of the gospel that sustain those imperatives woven into the warp and woof of the new testaments exposition of what it means for us to be holy is the great groundwork that the self existent thrice holy triune god has in himself by himself and for himself committed himself and all three persons of his being to bringing about the holiness of his own people this is the fathers purpose the sons purchase and the spirits ministry
8550993 be kind to one another tenderhearted forgiving one another as god in christ forgave you
8550994 a total ceasefire is unacceptable because of the fact that we have a law to enforce
8550995 i think there will be tactical adjustments it will depend upon the commander operating in one area
8550996 but it also depends on how the fugitives will use ramadan to shield their actions i mean what they have done are un islamic how do you expect them to conform to islamic norms when they have slaughtered people
8550997 if the evidence shows it then the evidence will point out too that they have not been sincere in the peace process all along
8550998 i mean the question of proving sincerity and good faith now lies squarely on the shoulders of the milf i mean coddling criminals is not a sign of bona fide sincerity in anyones book
8550999 i dont want people to do jobs i want them to become entrepreneurs

8551004 rock music is one genre that singaporeans are not yet recognised for internationally
8551005 the unique thing about us is our backstory that we found our vocalist over the internet and shes from singapore also our sound is totally different what i have to offer are indonesian influences and melodies that dont sound anything like the typical american or brit songs
8551006 if a woman can rock people are already amazed but if an english speaking asian woman from a small island can rock people are totally shocked

8551027 by knowing this minimum galaxy mass we can better understand how dark matter behaves which is essential to one day learning how our universe and life as we know it came to be
8551028 we are excited because these galaxies are virtually invisible yet contain a tremendous amount of dark matter
8551029 this helps us better understand the particle that makes up dark matter and it teaches us something about how galaxies form in the universe
8551030 anoles are highly visual species so in that sense its not surprising that they would use visual displays to mark territory still the finding is surprising because these are the first animals known to use non acoustic signalling at dawn and dusk
8551031 these patterns have remarkable parallels with the dawn and dusk choruses reported for many acoustically communicating animals
8551032 the dawn chorus may be a way of communicating having survived the night if in the morning a bird doesnt hear its neighbour or an anole doesnt see its neighbour it may be an opportunity for the animal to expand its territory
8551033 all of these behaviors are displays of physical vigor as in humans if an anole can do many of these push ups it shows that he is in prime physical condition these displays of strength help avert actual physical confrontations between male lizards which can be very fierce and destructive
8551034 although it is relatively rare to find the eggs and babies of extinct animals it is even rarer to find them inside the body of the mother
8551035 the turtle specimen was partly broken when it was first discovered it is this fortuitous break that revealed that the fossil was a mother

8551067 this may offer real benefit to patients who are treated promptly after diagnosis
8551068 there is a feeling among doctors that you should not put somebody on a drug until you really really have to but this work suggests that giving drugs at an early stage has an effect over and above what you would expect

8551075 the ppp government could not do anything in this regard
8551076 theres been all this build up to it and were finally getting going getting rolling
8551077 the draft is past news i know ive got a lot of work to do ive just got to keep working hard i owe it to them to work hard i owe it to myself to work hard
8551078 ive just got to be myself and bring to the team what i can bring
8551079 everybody is striving to be the best and prove themselves so its a good environment to be in
8551080 that weight and responsibility is going to have to come from the older guys the guys that have been here and have been waiting for that opportunity
8551081 but change occurs and this is a non points event this is a special event so well move forward with it
8551082 i talked to general manager bill farnsworth and he assured me that all three cars in question were not in the rotation of those that andrew would be driving
8551083 while we are capable of meeting current demand there is a backlog of high priority patients
8551084 in that context the decision to outsource to an australian hospital with the capacity to perform that surgery within the next three months makes sense
8551085 while we are capable of meeting current demand there is a backlog of high priority patients
8551086 it looks as though the hurricane is on track to inflicting damage
8551087 but change occurs and this is a non points event this is a special event so well move forward with it
8551088 i talked to general manager bill farnsworth and he assured me that all three cars in question were not in the rotation of those that andrew would be driving
8551089 i think in these matters its best to proceed with all due care and deliberation and of course people are always innocent until proven guilty
8551090 on information currently to hand there are serious questions whether donations intended for one purpose may have been put to a different purpose
8551091 if they had the courtesy to talk to me this matter would have been cleared up in a few minutes
8551092 mallika is expected to arrive here in the next few days and give the final approval to complete her home
8551093 this is a one hall and one bedroom hut and built with mud and overlooks the majestic arabian sea near vizhinjam im sorry i cant reveal the exact location the roof of the hut is yet to be decided and it would be finalised once she is here most probably it would be one with bamboo and tiles
8551094 its got to do with education and a lack of staffing and a lack of resources
8551095 we know if residents have more one on one attention we wouldnt need as many sedatives
8551096 its better to manage them through reducing the use of tea and coffee and giving hot milky drinks rather than giving sleeping tablets
8551097 its important to try other strategies rather than move straight on to medications that help people sleep and sedate them
8551098 there were a lot of concerns about how fast the economy was slowing with this strong capital expenditure theres a possibility that the gdp for the second quarter will be better than expected
8551099 the rba may not be as aggressive in its rate cuts
8551100 first and foremost of our goals is attraction and recruitment of a chief executive officer a review of the design and the plans that have been prepared previously for the museum and of course getting the project under construction as quickly as possible next year
8551101 its a broad diverse and excellent group of experienced people
8551102 australia is not immune to sexual slavery it hasnt stopped the sad tragedy of this is we are still acting for women this situation is going on on a daily basis in australia its behind closed doors and run by very well organised international crime syndicates
8551103 the potential principle urges the reader to learn to believe in ones abilities and potentials to make the difference adding that the take off point to greatness begins the moment one starts to see oneself from the perspective of ones potential also the author posits that except one possesses a clear sense of mission the possibilities of succeeding in life is far from being a reality successful people according to him live with a sense of destiny they are also people on a mission who know that they are on earth for a divine assignment and purpose
8551104 killings and torture committed by military security forces protecting and paid for by emoi
8551105 sufficient evidence at this stage for their allegations of serious abuse

8551120 there is combat everyday in this province and that isnt going to end anytime soon
8551121 but we have to stay in the fight we have to stay active in order to prevail and not lose the initiative to the insurgents

8551148 it is disgraceful that border patrol agents are put in harms way and our government doesnt do everything reasonably within its power to protect us from marauding mexican soldiers and others
8551149 without a forceful response to these illegal incursions an agent will eventually be seriously wounded or killed it is only a matter of time
8551150 the incursions will not stop until the mexican military units and their commanders are held accountable for their actions
8551151 there is an international boundary for a reason and they are to be respected by both governments
8551152 we take very seriously our role in working with our international neighbors to address and resolve these situations
8551153 when considering the frequency of incursions and the threat these encounters pose to our border patrol agents it is critical that we take the necessary steps to ensure that mexican military and law enforcement personnel do not cross into the u s without our knowledge or consent
8551154 will result in a clearer delineation of the international border
8551155 saying the mexican soldiers did not know where they were and needed to make certain that the detained agent was who he said he was although rank and file border patrol agents in arizona said he was dressed in uniform and was driving a well marked white and green agency vehicle
8551156 a reasonable person would conclude that the soldiers knew exactly at whom they were pointing their rifles
8551157 had the agent panicked and fired a shot or attempted to flee in his vehicle there is little doubt the mexican soldiers would have opened fire
8551158 during past incursions the mexican government has denied it had soldiers in the area they have blamed impostors even when military humvees were involved
8551159 time after time they have gotten away with these incursions and time after time our government has not taken a forceful stand against them
8551160 to address the incursion and limit or prevent the likelihood of similar incidents in the future
8551161 we have had excellent feedback from lots of the people that came along
8551162 it was one of the best tattoos ever and a real fitting finale
8551163 these are lifelong carers there is no retirement for them they have been looking after a son or daughter for 20 30 or even 50 years they are living from day to day often are quite lonely and if an emergency happens they are ill for instance there is no back up plan
8551164 if arthur and i were to be taken ill at the same time wed be up the creek without a paddle as it is i worry about what will happen to her if joanne outlives us i remember seeing a young woman come into a residential home where i worked
8551165 her mother had died and although her father had struggled on as best he could eventually she was put in a residential home she looked as though shed been taken off planet earth and planted on the moon she was so bewildered and had no idea of what was happening to her i couldnt bear to think of joanne in such a situation
8551166 joanne was very slow and we thought she was frail and were terrified shed get pneumonia or something but in time we realised she was actually a sturdy child now we know she is likely to outlive us
8551167 arthur and i have vowed that whichever of us goes first the other will make it their main point to see joanne settled but i know i would cheat because i couldnt bear to be parted from her id miss her too much
8551168 the community council has reacted swiftly to the proposals by arranging a public meeting this week
8551169 i had hoped post office ltd representatives would attend this meeting but because of the heavy demand placed on them during this process no one was available
8551170 however i have convinced them to attend a further public meeting in september when post office ltd come they should already be clear about what local peoples concerns are about the proposals
8551171 i would therefore expect their representatives to address those concerns and hopefully consider more acceptable proposals for service provision in the village
8551172 i do not think that many people will be aware that as late as march of this year russell brown had the opportunity to stand up for the interests of this region and vote against the post office closures programme
8551173 nineteen of his labour colleagues did take a principled stand including former social security minister frank field
8551174 i think people need to be made aware that mr brown is talking a good game in his constituency about saving post offices but has taken no action whatsoever in westminster
8551175 it is the height of hypocrisy for mr brown to try to duck the question and the height of foolishness to assume that nobody would notice
8551176 russell brown mp should come clean and admit that he has supported the government throughout this process and accept responsibility for the implications of it for the communities he serves
8551177 it is held that public confidence must lie at the heart of all planning decisions and is therefore considered a material consideration relevant to the petrol filling station proposal
8551178 no further development on the site should be allowed to permit more development now would erode public confidence entirely
8551179 entirely lawful and indeed proper for the current application to be determined not withstanding any complaint which may remain unresolved from mr henry or anyone else
8551180 indeed not to do would support a claim for maladministration against the local authority
8551181 to defer the determination of all planning decisions pending the resolution of outstanding complaints would be entirely contrary to the emphasis placed in national guidance upon administrative efficiency and certainty within the planning system and would lead to unwarranted delay regardless of the merits of otherwise of the complaint
8551182 his concern with public confidence in the planning system and the extent which the determination of the current appeal has some bearing on that aspiration
8551183 what he mr wright proposed would in his view amount to an improvement on the current arrangements with no material loss of screening
8551184 mr wright was clear in his evidence that the weight attached by the council to the existing landscaping scheme was misplaced what was now proposed was an equally appropriate solution which would not have an adverse impact on local amenity
8551185 the impact of the proposed development would be materially detrimental and therefore unacceptable and would not be mitigated by the landscaping proposals forming part of the application that is to be determined or by the alternative landscaping scheme proposed by mr wright in his evidence
8551186 the development proposed would have a materially adverse impact on the character and amenity of the area and the setting of the supermarket

8551195 i could no longer study because i dont have a social security number so
8551196 i have grave concern that we continue to swim in a sea of illegal immigration
8551197 if we cannot control our borders we cannot control our destiny
8551198 its a contemptible statement to say they take jobs americans just wont do
8551199 do we want to be known as the state that opens its arms to illegal aliens
8551200 amen amen i say to you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up another way the same is a thief and a robber

8551202 prince william has been the catalyst for the expansion of the 287 g program across the u s
8551203 it coincides with the concerted effort by a well coordinated group of like minded people to put pressure on authorities to get involved in immigration enforcement
8551204 if you are an illegal immigrant you should be anxious and concerned about driving
8551205 to the extent that we have caused anxiety among the illegal community i think thats a good thing because we dont want them here in the first place
8551206 amen amen i say to you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up another way the same is a thief and a robber
8551207 i could no longer study because i dont have a social security number so

8551212 serious signal for those are trying to justify the aggression
8551213 russias recognition of the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia violates the territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia and is contrary to un security council resolutions supported by russia
8551214 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8551215 medvedevs unilateral attempt to redraw the map marks a moment of real significance
8551216 it is not just the end of the post cold war period of growing geopolitical calm in and around europe it is also the moment when countries are required to set out where they stand on the significant issues of nationhood and international law
8551217 we dont want a new cold war he has a big responsibility not to start one
8551218 my visit is designed to send a simple message we have not forgotten our commitments to you
8551219 over georgia russia has moved from support for territorial integrity to breaking up the country in three weeks and relied entirely on military force to do so in between it signed a ceasefire agreement which included international mediation as the way forward if her word is not her bond then she will not be trusted by anyone russia needs to ask itself about the relationship between short term military victories and longer term economic prosperity
8551220 europe needs to act as one when dealing with third parties like russia
8551221 must not learn the wrong lessons from the georgia crisis there can be no going back on fundamental principles of territorial integrity democratic governance and international law
8551222 russia is too enmeshed in the world economy it would be counterproductive
8551223 excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8551224 what has happened is a threat to everyone not just for one country any nation could be next when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity we put into doubt the existence of any country

8551227 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them

8551230 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8551231 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8551232 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8551233 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8551234 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8551294 when i was four my mum went out for the night and left me with a gay male friend who sexually abused me now im older i feel that could be one of the reasons she felt she was not capable of looking after me

8551305 as soon as somebody comes out for a politician especially in hollywood when they all go im voting for this guy i go thats not who im voting for
8551306 i truly believe that people like myself who are in a position of entertainers in the limelight should keep their mouth shut on politics because at the end of the day im good at writing songs and singing
8551307 what im not educated in is the field of political science and so for me to be sharing my views and influencing people of who i think they should be voting for i think would be very irresponsible on my part

8551360 hes won twice this year his form has been very good in recent weeks and hes played on five ryder cups and had four winning teams and hes a natural partner to lee westwood
8551361 if you had everybody picking i think clarke would be a lock but obviously nick could see different reasons but if i was picking id be picking darren
8551362 darren carries stature into the ryder cup which is very important when you tee it up on the first tee you want your opposition standing there and feeling that theyre coming up against somebody who has a bit of stature darren has that and monty has that too
8551363 the guy has played eight ryder cups has never lost a singles match and hes due a consideration
8551364 my opinion is that until he loses a singles match maybe he should be given a chance
8551365 two months ago you would have picked monty paul casey has had a very solid two months and two months ago ian poulter finished second at the open
8551366 youve got four players playing for two spots all four have a case for being picked its going to be tough and two guys are going to be unhappy
8551367 the fact they havent played their way in if they dont get picked they cant complain

8551369 the special us envoy was first appointed by president clinton and has been critical to fostering peace and reconciliation in northern ireland
8551370 john mccain is committed to maintaining the special us envoy for northern ireland and that commitment has been enshrined in the 2008 republican platform
8551371 that senator obama would be willing to toss aside one of the signature diplomatic accomplishments of the clinton administration and put the progress in northern ireland at risk is only further evidence that he is simply not ready to lead
8551372 barack obama understands that us attention and support will be required to solidify the peace
8551373 but he also recognises that the crisis period for northern ireland has passed and that the people of northern ireland are now in charge of their own destiny
8551374 as president barack obama will personally engage on irish issues whenever necessary
8551375 barack obama will continue the tradition of welcoming the taoiseach to the white house on st patricks day and he intends to visit ireland as president

8551385 the government has failed to provide enough prison places so they want courts to make more use of community sentences but if one order in every three goes uncompleted and only a quarter of offenders complete their training then the criminal justice system just becomes a laughing stock
8551386 community sentences need to be robust with strict sanctions for non compliance and real visibility so people can see that the offender is paying back for his crimes until this happens the public are bound to view community orders as a soft option
8551387 having sat for many years as a local magistrate i see first hand the difficulty in enforcing and supporting community service orders the national probation service is in desperate need of more support from this government

8551394 we are very happy that the judge in this case recognized our compliance with the dmca and our efforts to respect copyrights
8551395 it is great to see the court confirm that the dmca protects services like youtube that follow the law and respect copyrights

8551402 ive told the police not to break up the crowd but to encourage people to leave
8551403 we wont leave government house as ordered by the civil court
8551404 our demands remain the same to have the government resign and to prevent an amendment of the 2007 constitution
8551405 as the police have so far shown restraint and resisted efforts to disperse the crowd by force and shoulder the consequences the pad is pinning its hopes on some men in green sharing its goal of toppling the government
8551406 samak would love to do a 1976 and go in and shoot them all down thats his style but the police desperately dont want that to happen because it would really do no good to anybody

8551440 my son ricky was in my bedroom looking for his underwear and he went into the draw under my bed and something crawled across his hand
8551441 he saw a huge spider and screamed to his sister cassie they tried to put a pint glass over it but it was too big they poked it with a coat hanger and the spider bit it
8551442 the dog came in jumped on the bed and barked at it the spider hissed and bella went running out whimpering
8551443 there was an electrician in the house and he came and looked but just ran out of the house
8551444 they said it was the size of a palm sandy coloured with a pink body and red knees
8551445 i think it must have hitched a lift back with my husband in june so its been in my house for seven weeks hes back out there now i called him and he said one of his friends had been bitten by one
8551446 im petrified of spiders i cannot live in that house until its gone
8551447 she was an active healthy dog it seems too much of a coincidence that she died at the same time that we saw the spider
8551448 i wondered if she had been bitten or if it sprayed something into her face when it hissed at her
8551449 the vet said they wouldnt know without an autopsy but said there could have been an underlying condition which was brought on with the stress of it all
8551450 ive searched the house and cant find it i dont know what to do i just want to get back in there but i cant with that spider in there
8551451 we get calls all the time from people who have unpacked their suitcase and found a gecko from spain or a frog from namibia
8551452 its perfectly possibly this man has folded up the sand spider in his clothes and accidentally brought it home with him
8551453 camel spiders are also called sun spiders they have a huge head and massive mandibles and it gives a nasty painful bite
8551454 we understand there is a second spider which the caller could not find we would advise people with creatures like these to try and contain them other wise they are difficult to catch
8551455 if it is the spider they believe it is then normally they dont attack humans but they could give a painful bite

8551484 the us navy destroyer uss mcfaul which is currently docked in the georgian port of batumi carries about 50 tomahawk cruise missiles on board they are outfitted with nuclear warheads and are meant to hit ground targets the remaining nato ships are currently concentrated in the northern part of the black sea
8551485 it is strange that such a large group of nato warships has arrived for a joint exercise with bulgaria or romania usually only one or two warships participate in such exercises so the attempts to substantiate the presence of the naval group with a military exercise does not withstand any criticism
8551486 it is clear that all statements made by the political and defense administration of nato members are accompanied with outspoken militarist demarches the use of nuclear weapons by nato ships in the black sea is out of the question the conventional weapons which the nato naval group has in the region are more than enough to achieve any defense goals which can be exemplified with yugoslavia

8551488 the absence of control over the cargoes which nato warships deliver to georgia cannot but raise concerns with us when theres no control theres no guarantee that various weapons for example man portable missile systems have not been or will not be delivered to georgia it can also be reconnaissance equipment including unmanned aerial vehicles
8551489 we have the main attack force of natos navy in the black sea which acts under the guise of delivering humanitarian cargo or holding military exercises

8551692 people magazine has garnered a large subscription and newsstand readership over the years so they can offer country a built in consumer base im especially pleased that people country special gives our new artists a platform for exposure not only in the magazine but also by the downloads offered on its web site this gives readers a chance to learn more about the artists and also hear their music and thats a great promotional tool ive placed several of my baby acts in the publication with wonderful results
8551693 people are very interested but if anything i think were educating more of them to be interested in this market when i launched teen people that was one of the biggest wakeup calls in that while many people were marketing to teens at that time we were able to wake up two to three times that many marketers to the market based on the success they were having the same thing is happening here with country were bringing new marketers to this world that are waking up and deciding that this is a market to focus on
8551694 part of our incubation strategy at people is that we try to keep our fingers on the pulse of what people are talking about and what they want to read now and so we constantly debate frequency on the specials and the number we produce
8551695 its a fluid concept we want to stay connected to the customer to make sure were not over delivering or under delivering the information its a two way communication so with country weve gone from one time to four times a year were listening to the consumer and if there is an interest in increasing our frequency beyond that we will
8551696 country has maintained its popularity for a very long time
8551697 its not a trend other genres of music wax and wane in terms of relevance or lifestyle elements you see it with pop and hip hop and r amp b the market changes over time but country is unique its been around for a long time and it will be around for a long time to come
8551698 the era of cheap energy is over the question is how are we going to adjust to that and what sort of help can we provide to those who are going to struggle the most
8551699 there is genuine concern about the difficulties that people will face paying their heating bills over the coming winter and we are looking at extra support
8551700 what we shouldnt do is create a climate that makes it harder to attract new investment the new nuclear investment the new renewables investment the new investment in clean coal and gas
8551701 we need 100bn plus in the next 10 years so weve got to create the right framework that encourages investment so we must not lose sight of that
8551702 and we shouldnt do anything that has the effect of putting up bills further
8551703 energy security is fundamental to our existence as an independent democratic free state
8551704 i think the events not just in georgia but over a longer timescale have really confirmed the growing importance of energy independence for the uk
8551705 russia has huge energy resources and could be a really good partner for europe but its harder to do that when you see what is unfolding on the international stage
8551706 we must do as much as we can to get energy from indigenous sources britain needs more energy suppliers its harder to for us to have those energy relationships with countries that behave in the way russia has been doing lately
8551707 of course weve got to tackle climate change its a real and present danger for us but weve also got to be absolutely clear that our energy policy has got to be figured first and foremost with a view to supplying britain with affordable and secure energy it needs for the future
8551708 that is why we cannot turn our back on any proven form of technology we cannot afford to say no to new coal new gas or new nuclear
8551709 we need to make progress with that transaction as quickly as we possibly can hmg is a minority shareholder
8551710 its for the majority of shareholders to come to a view about how they want the future of that company to be addressed we are clear that the edf deal is a good one it will allow us to fast track nuclear development
8551711 making a profit is better than making a loss and if we want these companies to invest significant resources investors are not going to do that if they dont think theres a reasonable return to be made on their investment

8551716 i wish the help had reached us on time that way at least my children could have been safe
8551717 my child is so ill i cannot do a thing about it i wonder what i did wrong that my child must suffer
8551718 serious signal for those are trying to justify the aggression
8551719 the sight of russian tanks in a neighboring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain
8551720 was not a step taken lightly or without full consideration of the consequences
8551721 relations between nations living under one roof need to be handled with the utmost sensitivity
8551722 reconciled itself to the loss of 14 former soviet republics which became states in their own right
8551723 immediately stripped its autonomous regions of abkhazia and south ossetia of their autonomy
8551724 fears and aspirations of the south ossetian and abkhazian peoples
8551725 the continued russian presence in georgia outside of abkhazia and south ossetia for example in poti represents a significant violation of the six point plan agreement
8551726 we think we have a real good team this year and were going to surprise some people
8551727 a three month period would be a reasonable extent of time for us to play that role to bring together the peace process
8551728 we are concerned about the continuing violence and this is the first segment of our address so that violence should stop
8551729 were probably a day or two away from being very confident about where it will land
8551730 i wish the help had reached us on time that way at least my children could have been safe
8551731 my child is so ill i cannot do a thing about it i wonder what i did wrong that my child must suffer
8551732 this is the reality we are facing our concern is that consumers buying power is decreasing
8551733 if this situation continues long term it would affect sony
8551734 sony would like to address the needs of this drastically expanding market to establish a leading position
8551735 we cannot remain a global industry leader without a strong presence in india
8551736 this will enable us to capture more opportunities in one of the fastest growing vehicle markets in the world
8551737 this is just one of a number of investments gm has made over the course of the last few years in emerging markets around the world and is an important component of gms global strategy

8551754 i dont know how i can prove that but feel free to test me
8551755 i figured a good first step in my preparation would be finding out what facebook is so ive started this page
8551756 the russian side has stressed the need for tbilisi to carry out point four of the medvedev sarkozy plan under which all georgian troops should be returned to their original bases
8551757 medvedev and sarkozy also discussed additional agreements which may in future ensure safety in the areas near the borders of south ossetia and abkhazia
8551758 there was a subversion of the constitution on november 3 and that is what people are protesting against
8551759 we are committed to the supremacy of the constitution and this will continue until the actions of november 3 are reversed
8551760 nach bekanntgabe unserer investment pl ne bei der bankverein werther ag haben uns euphorische stimmen von aktion ren erreicht scheinbar haben die aktion re genug von jahrelangen experimenten
8551761 die unterst tzung unserer pl ne durch die aktion re auf der morgen stattfindenden hauptversammlung wird ma geblich sein wir vertrauen auf die unterst tzung der aktion re denn unsere strategie wird zukunft und wert des bankvereins nachhaltig sichern und so auch die kurse wieder steigen lassen
8551762 die zeit der experimente ist vorbei man muss sich beim bankverein werther von den jahrelangen behelfsm igen versuchen auf dem r cken der aktion re verabschieden der freitag ist wohl die letzte chance dazu
8551763 unsere ziele sind einfach werte erhalten und zwar durch fokus auf ein traditionsorientiertes kerngesch ft in dem aus unserer sicht viel potenzial schlummert von riskanten und unausgegorenen konzepten wie einer beteiligung der net mobile ag und den damit zu erwartenden riskanten operativen schritten halten wir herzlich wenig
8551764 you think because you dont yell youre not mean this is mean
8551765 the boy saw the comet he felt as though his life had meaning it went away he waited his entire life for it to come back to him
8551766 after i used it for three days all of my acne dried up and went away
8551767 it is very effective some people dont believe in it but people who do really get a good result
8551768 after that my friends who work at garment factories in phnom penh advised me to apply the lubricant from number one plus condoms on my face every night
8551769 and just within three to four nights the acne on my face gradually and then totally disappeared

8551774 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8551775 the advisers mahdis figures contradict statistics issued by the ministry in 2006 for example and a press conference by the minister himself earlier this month
8551776 they the ministry want to give the impression that power generating capacity was on the rise but that is not true
8551777 the outcome does not match the amount of money spent on electricity
8551778 a three month period would be a reasonable extent of time for us to play that role to bring together the peace process
8551779 we are concerned about the continuing violence and this is the first segment of our address so that violence should stop
8551780 i thought the next thing to do would be to make a sculpture of the person whos the ideal beauty of the moment but even kate moss doesnt live up to the image
8551781 shanghai cooperation organization as a whole is that this is one region where close cooperation is not really building deeper trust between the countries involved
8551782 there is still at the root a fundamental mistrust among the members of the cooperation group and that mistrust about the intentions of russia of china particularly amongst the smaller members of the group is really the key flaw in this organization
8551783 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8551784 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8551785 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8551786 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8551787 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8551788 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8551789 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8551790 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8551791 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8551792 isolation the loss of respect and the loss of trust
8551793 i thought it was very important at this stage to say to friendly countries like the ukraine that we were determined to support their democratic choices
8551794 the point i want to underline above all others is that whats happened since the collapse of the soviet union is not a western plot
8551795 its a series of decisions by independent sovereign democracies about the course that they want to take not a course of confrontation with russia but a course of engagement with the west which i think is wholly within their rights and is something weve been right to support
8551796 we dont accept that the choice for ukraine is that either you are an enemy of russia or you are a vassal of russia you can be a partner of the west you can be a partner of russia
8551797 its right to talk about an international crisis theres no question of launching an all out war against russia
8551798 we are in a situation which marks a clear end to the relative and growing calm in and around europe since the collapse of the soviet union
8551799 the last 15 or so years have seen a period in which europes borders have been clearly demarcated new nations have come out of the old soviet union theyve joined the european union
8551800 and the european countries have enjoyed a period of unprecedented stability i think that the danger that arises from russian actions is that that period comes to an end
8551801 we the foreign ministers of canada france germany italy japan the united states and the united kingdom condemn the action of our fellow g8 member
8551802 i wouldnt agree that we really have a threat of a new cold war russia was is and will continue to be the last country in the world that would want a repeat of the cold war
8551803 the most important thing was to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe

8551829 there is genuine concern about the difficulties that people will face paying their heating bills over the coming winter and we are looking at extra support
8551830 what we shouldnt do is create a climate that makes it harder to attract new investment the new nuclear investment the new renewables investment the new investment in clean coal and gas
8551831 we need 100bn plus in the next 10 years so weve got to create the right framework that encourages investment so we must not lose sight of that

8551833 energy security is fundamental to our existence as an independent democratic free state

8551847 she appeared to be working alone which was clearly a very dangerous thing to do
8551848 we fear that the men she was reporting on attacked her in the wood where they were staying

8551884 uskup setempat juga tidak senang namun mereka juga tidak memahami saya
8551885 if you have a look at the numbers overall they show that the domestic economy remains pretty robust
8551886 its down to the fact that the mining boom is having a significant impact but its not just mining you are seeing it across other areas as well with transportation and construction remaining quite strong
8551887 the important factor is that there are other economies around the world that are noticing a pretty significant slow down but were in a much more enviable position
8551888 it is reassuring for the reserve bank that the death of the australian economy is not at our doors yet
8551889 this sort of gives them some light at the end of the tunnel weve seen weakness in consumer sentiment weve seen weaker business sentiment numbers but really it hasnt translated into a weaker investment number yet
8551890 really the supply side of the economy is pretty well primed to grow quite rapidly and absorb the inflationary pressures so wages will remain in check
8551891 it gives the reserve bank the option of making that rate cut come next week
8551892 i think theyve compounded the problem and i think thats why wayne swan really has been the worst treasurer in australias history
8551893 its just unbelievable that labor could trash business confidence so quickly and comprehensively
8551894 the anger behind the strike is all driven by not just the jobs cuts but the clear view that theres no strategy behind the job cuts
8551895 the first is the ongoing collective agreement to discuss the failure of the company to make a decent offer on that
8551896 and secondly its driven by this really deep frustration at the failure of the company to clearly articulate the strategy it has to continue to produce quality newspapers magazines and websites with significantly fewer staff
8551897 according to the abs australian bureau of statistics data today the private capital expenditure rose by a stronger than expected 5 7 per cent in the june 2008 quarter
8551898 i would ask this question why is it that when theres positive economic data out there that those opposite find no reason to embrace that in their argument at all
8551899 it suggest that therell be continued capital expenditure to try and alleviate some of the constraints that have prevailed for several years now so it definitely is a positive thing for medium term inflation
8551900 with china mobile still holding roughly 70 market share of the total mobile subscriber base in china we are concerned that the provincial management staff of the other two mobile operators may act irrationally and attempt to gain subscriber market share at the expense of profitability
8551901 in view of the lagged development of td scdma market china mobile would be at a disadvantage in competing with its rivals with matured 3g technology in the 3g market in china in our view
8551902 this is a side of english football we really do not want to see

8551913 there wont be any aggressive action from anyone on our side we will behave in a pragmatic manner there will definitely not be a cold war
8551914 kill you i dont want to kill you what would i do without you you you complete
8551915 but the devil knows what among themselves they think about us and what is in the heart of any of them i will never learn to read an american by face to see if he is a swindler or if he considers me a swindler its murder to live in such an environment
8551916 treating russia as both a whipping boy and a potential beneficiary of american philanthropy
8551917 fostered in many americans a heady sense of their countrys unique blessings and reaffirmed their special role in the world
8551918 but at least we arent the decadent racist and hypocritical americans
8551919 the boy saw the comet he felt as though his life had meaning it went away he waited his entire life for it to come back to him
8551920 there could be more infiltrators hiding in some other areas on the outskirts of the city and the need is to maintain vigilance
8551921 we safely rescued six hostages ten people including three civilians three hostages an army officer and three militants were killed during the operation
8551922 well your numbers were down you played hurt but we have to consider your injury history
8551923 we have no boundaries and want to take this music to as many people as we can
8551924 we always strive to educate our audiences about the breadth and depth of country music its many facets and influences
8551925 americana music which embraces music in all of its root forms is very representative of that vast scope and were pleased to offer these programs to ama registrants and our own visitors
8551926 our programs with the country music hall of fame this year are awesome and we are excited npt shares our appreciation for great music
8551927 the roots of americana run deep throughout the great american musical traditions and we are thrilled to be working with the museum on these special programs
8551928 both the ama and the country music hall of fame and museum celebrate the roots of contemporary american music
8551929 by broadcasting and promoting what we feel is some of the best music programming in nashville especially of the americana and country variety we feel were a part of that celebration as well its a perfect partnership
8551930 i heard about it on one of the local news stations on my commute in that they were offering the chance to drive these
8551931 youre not sacrificing anything and actually for me its an enhanced driving experience
8551932 i think thats a misconception people have that youre puttering around in an underpowered cramped little soapbox
8551933 its allowed people to live with these vehicles in a way that they dont have to feel restricted in the distances they can travel or where they can go
8551934 as i was putting him in the car i was wondering is it the engine noise that quiets the baby or the road noise we had no idea
8551935 im not able to discuss any specifics of this tentative agreement
8551936 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8551937 i love this but we have important work to do tonight
8551938 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8551939 ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8551940 he has a remarkable ability to inspire people to raise our hopes and rally us to high purpose
8551941 his policies on the economy taxes health care and energy are far superior to the republican alternatives and in his first presidential decision the selection of a running mate he hit it out of the park
8551942 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be the commander in chief sound familiar
8551943 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8551944 it is indicative of the concern among democratic voters about barack obamas inexperience that after three full days of the democratic national convention president clinton was finally forced to testify that sen obama is ready to be president despite his previous arguments to the contrary
8551945 he still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8551946 they actually want us to reward them for the last eight years by giving them four more
8551947 lets send them a message that will echo from the rockies all across america thanks but no thanks in this case the third time is not the charm
8551948 always want people to believe they have a limited agenda so they bombed the railway that brings azeri oil to georgia and bp has been forced to stop its shipments of azeri oil to georgia by rail because the bridge has been bombed but they wouldnt bomb a pipeline which is not directly linked to supplying georgia
8551949 i think they wanted to create the strong perception that they were dealing with a limited set of problems which are georgia centered bombing btc would have been too open an aggression an act unrelated to the issue at hand
8551950 the pipeline itself was not bombed of course but the bombing did come awfully close
8551951 my personal belief is that the russians have put themselves into the position to be able to have some measure of control over the pipeline even if they have not hit it directly
8551952 you can make the point that russia has always met its contractual commitments that its been an extremely reliable supplier at least to western europe over the past four decades which is true
8551953 but at the same time the political perception is something else and now the political perception is that russia is not a reliable supplier or at least its a politically problematic supplier this will again increase the legitimacy of energy policies aimed at substituting away from gas not necessarily only from russian gas but from gas itself
8551954 gazprom needs europe as much as europe needs gazprom more in fact i believe that european gas sales account currently for about 60 percent of gazproms total revenues losing that would hurt the company very much
8551955 cycles in capital flows to emerging markets have now been with us for two hundred years
8551956 i was a high class muscleman for big business for wall street and for the bankers
8551957 in short i was a racketeer a gangster for capitalism
8551958 i helped make mexico especially tampico safe for american oil interests in 1914 i helped make haiti and cuba a decent place for the national city bank boys to collect revenues in i helped in the raping of half a dozen central american republics for the benefit of wall street the record of racketeering is long i helped purify nicaragua for the international banking house of brown brothers in 1909 1912 i brought light to the dominican republic for american sugar interests in 1916 in china i helped to see to it that standard oil went its way unmolested
8551959 i was contacted by a woman named claudine who became my trainer as an economic hit man
8551960 she said she was sent to help me and to train me
8551961 she is extremely beautiful sensual seductive intelligent her job was to convince me to become an economic hit man holding out these three drugs sex drugs and money and then she wanted to let me know that i was getting into a dirty business and i shouldnt go off on my first assignment which was going to be indonesia and start doing this unless i knew that i was going to continue doing it and once i was in i was in for life
8551962 the system is set up such that the countries are so deep in debt that they cant repay their debt
8551963 when the u s government wants favors from them like votes in the united nations or troops in iraq or in many many cases their resources their oil their canal in the case of panama we go to them and say look you cant pay off your debts therefore sell your oil at a very low price to our oil companies today tremendous pressure is being put on ecuador for example to sell off its amazonian rainforest very precious very fragile places inhabited by indigenous people whose cultures are being destroyed by the oil companies
8551964 at that first meeting the president of the company mentioned some of the books that i had written about indigenous people and said thats nice thats fine keep doing your non profit work
8551965 we approve of that but you certainly would never write about this industry would you and i assured him that i wouldnt
8551966 how to survive the crisis and prosper in the process
8551967 were mad as hell and we wont take it anymore
8551968 most of the world is bemused by western moralising on georgia
8551969 should support the underdog georgia against russia most support russia against the bullying west the gap between the western narrative and the rest of the world could not be clearer
8551970 account for the interests of advanced industrial nations to discourage them from challenging our leadership
8551971 were mad as hell and we wont take it anymore
8551972 things will not bounce back we are heading for a pretty difficult challenge and we need to take a surgical look at costs across the whole business
8551973 were looking at a three figure loss in 2009 potentially if we dont look at our costs
8551974 we spoke about this already and so i mean it ought to be right
8551975 you must know what is wrong and how to correct it
8551976 cannot stand wrong intonation i know i put the conductors in an embarrassing situation but they have to be able to do it
8551977 you dont hear what they are doing you are in your own world and you are going too quickly
8551978 you have to know the culture to know the score and to project what you want to hear some conductors are well prepared but cannot transmit their ideas to an orchestra and others are good communicators but have nothing to transmit because they are not absorbed enough in the score
8551979 but i am doing a lot of things they may be small movements but they are directed exactly to the musician who needs them and in performance the force is always more because of the excitement of the concert
8551980 you have to impose your will not with a hammer but you have to be able to convince people of your point of view
8551981 audiences follow the orchestra the problem is that performers say oh my god if i programme schoenberg nobody will come and thats not true last year with the berlin philharmonic i played music by bart k schoenberg berg and webern the literature of before the first world war and i was told by some people that this was a difficult programme i say all these works are composed before 1914 thats not new do you think in 1940 people were saying my god tristan und isolde is so difficult to listen to 80 years after it was written the 20th century is famous for being the century of speed but the speed is not there when it comes to culture i find
8551982 i can live for months without performance and i am not deprived at all
8551983 i am looking more and more to write works on a long trajectory
8551984 all the people with whom i was very close at one point in my life stockhausen berio ligeti nono bernd alois zimmermann they are all gone
8551985 with berio with whom i kept a good relationship we only met once a year or so and with stockhausen we had almost no contact in the last decades because he made himself alone
8551986 i also live rather alone in business in the music world people know that i can be very friendly and warm but that after a certain moment the business is closed i like to be alone in order to concentrate on my work the social life does not exist it has never existed for me really i have chosen instead the working life because i prefer that i like to work otherwise i do not know what i would do
8551987 after the mahler i will go to baden baden where i have a house far away from this madding world
8551988 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8551989 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8551990 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8551991 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8551992 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8551993 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8551994 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8551995 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8551996 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8551997 he is such an interesting person with strong opinions and immense musical talent he does not mince words when he dislikes something but when he talks about music he respects he is an outspoken fan

8552005 even though its not snowing a lot out here i might as well start shoveling the snow off the walkway besides i dont have anything else to do anyway
8552006 i cant believe that im sweating so much and worst of all im sweating on my feet more ok time to fix the problem here

8552017 the next time you throw snowballs at me ill hurt you more
8552018 even though its not snowing a lot out here i might as well start shoveling the snow off the walkway besides i dont have anything else to do anyway
8552019 even 50 years ago hire purchase was surrounded by stigma
8552020 its to do with avoidance of pain and the maximisation of pleasure
8552021 we expect instant gratification and with the shift away from living with scarcity or according to necessity thats become a benchmark of success and a basic human right in modern western capitalist society
8552022 theres a link too with the decline in organised religion a bit of suffering was seen to be a good thing morally it gave people backbone and that was what was expected whereas today there is no agenda other than to maximise our pleasure through our consumption habits and practices we have a generation of people who have no idea of privation of what it is to go without and to them the idea that they cant have it easy is anathema of course its fashionable to talk about ethical consumption but it seems to me thats not much more than a veneer when it comes to turning down the heating that strikes a bit too close to home
8552023 its easy to say you can go without were soft now but people did suffer from the cold and winter was anticipated with some dread central heating is convenient you just flick a switch and once you can do that habits change we heat the whole house now because families no longer congregate in one room theyre scattered throughout the house doing different activities i dont see people going back to being sewn into their vests at the beginning of winter
8552024 my mother and i have been texting back and forth this whole week all about the convention about what i see versus what cnn or msnbc are covering or
8552025 your life is devastated my marriage broke up my father and baby daughter died while i was inside and i had to go to their funerals in handcuffs when i was finally cleared i left prison with a 44 discharge grant in my pocket it has taken me ten years to rebuild my life
8552026 the government says it is making the scheme more in line with compensation for victims of crime as though it is somehow unfair if we get more but nobody in their right mind would do 11 years inside for 1 million
8552027 we havent taken on a case since the new system was introduced
8552028 this had been a sensible no fault compensation system that avoided costly and damaging civil litigation to prove fault on the part of the police or prosecution abolishing it and refusing to pay proper rates is a false economy as there will now be an incentive for people to litigate
8552029 we think we have a real good team this year and were going to surprise some people
8552030 when i led the louisiana community and technical college system we looked to college of the mainland to learn from you about what youre doing with process technology
8552031 were probably a day or two away from being very confident about where it will land
8552032 index was out of range must be non negative and less than the size of the collection parameter name index
8552033 the era of cheap energy is over the question is how are we going to adjust to that and what sort of help can we provide to those who are going to struggle the most
8552034 there is genuine concern about the difficulties that people will face paying their heating bills over the coming winter and we are looking at extra support
8552035 what we shouldnt do is create a climate that makes it harder to attract new investment the new nuclear investment the new renewables investment the new investment in clean coal and gas
8552036 we need 100bn plus in the next 10 years so weve got to create the right framework that encourages investment so we must not lose sight of that
8552037 and we shouldnt do anything that has the effect of putting up bills further
8552038 energy security is fundamental to our existence as an independent democratic free state
8552039 i think the events not just in georgia but over a longer timescale have really confirmed the growing importance of energy independence for the uk
8552040 russia has huge energy resources and could be a really good partner for europe but its harder to do that when you see what is unfolding on the international stage
8552041 we must do as much as we can to get energy from indigenous sources britain needs more energy suppliers its harder to for us to have those energy relationships with countries that behave in the way russia has been doing lately
8552042 of course weve got to tackle climate change its a real and present danger for us but weve also got to be absolutely clear that our energy policy has got to be figured first and foremost with a view to supplying britain with affordable and secure energy it needs for the future
8552043 that is why we cannot turn our back on any proven form of technology we cannot afford to say no to new coal new gas or new nuclear
8552044 we need to make progress with that transaction as quickly as we possibly can hmg is a minority shareholder
8552045 its for the majority of shareholders to come to a view about how they want the future of that company to be addressed we are clear that the edf deal is a good one it will allow us to fast track nuclear development
8552046 making a profit is better than making a loss and if we want these companies to invest significant resources investors are not going to do that if they dont think theres a reasonable return to be made on their investment
8552047 this is a side of english football we really do not want to see
8552048 if it doesnt happen it wont be for the want of trying

8552054 i booked and fully paid for a holiday with major tour operator due to commence in august this year i was advised that the holiday was cancelled on 7th june but have not received a refund yet despite at least three requests and a recorded delivery request what should i do next
8552055 i never fail to be amazed that holidaymakers have to wait for the return of their money often without interest would the directors of these companies wait 5 or 6 weeks or in some cases much longer for the return of their cash i think we know the answer to that question it is also worthy to note that some companies have torturous methods by which they process such issues it is simple when the package travel directive or regulations are being redrafted or amended there must be clear timescales for the return of consumer monies along with interest if those timeframes are not satisfied

8552066 how best can i incorporate my mainframe in the soa architecture
8552067 after the disappointment of last weekend at mosport its back to work and trying to overcome a 10 point disadvantage before we get to the petit race the guys including our drivers are even more motivated to restore the 71 car to the front and this will be a good place to achieve such a result i think our fans know that we were unfairly penalized last week the calls and emails ive gotten have been very supportive so we will try very hard to give them something to cheer about this saturday
8552068 last year detroit was one of the best races i had the corners are very slippery and it is a very low grip track i really like the track with our good ferrari it will be good for us last year the ferraris were pretty quick there dirk was very fast there so i think we are a good team and we will have a good result there
8552069 i am really looking forward to detroit we have won two street courses so far this year so it is quite obvious that dominik and myself are feeling at home in those conditions like dom i have been to detroit last year i was on the podium there with the ferrari and i know we can be really quick over there with all the improvements porsche made over the winter the competition is quite tight there is no longer a track that is good for the ferrari and one that is good for the others that means it will be a tight battle again the track is quite demanding with the slow and slippery corners but the name there is belle isle and i found it quite beautiful quite nice there last year we had good crowds and i am looking forward to having a fantastic race in detroit
8552070 detroit will be my first street course in the sports cars i have done a lot of them in open wheel so hopefully i can get up to speed pretty quickly also it is a short weekend so hopefully by qualifying and the race i am comfortable i think jim has made some huge gains this weekend that i think will transfer into next weekend i am looking forward to it i still have a lot of friends over in the indy cars so i am looking forward to the atmosphere of the street courses
8552071 the level of focus on the street courses has to be so high dealing with narrow lines and blind corners makes it very difficult to overtake as well to be overtaken by faster classes the consequences if you lose focus at belle isle are unforgivable mistakes are very costly in terms of time and dollars my level of focus and the street course experience that alex figge brings to the table should give us a good direction for a top five finish

8552078 there was togetherness and focus that is what we wanted after a result like saturday
8552079 we needed to be organised because they play a little with your patience we were disciplined and focused and we were never really under threat
8552080 i felt the whole team was sharp physically we were much better than saturday

8552103 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8552104 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8552105 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8552106 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8552134 the vehicle was going to pick up prisoners and as it reached a bridge an explosive laden car exploded and nine of our policemen and two passers by were killed
8552135 its a moment of national solidarity the opposition has called a moratorium on open differences with the government because the country is occupied
8552136 i think there will be a few months before people think about making political trouble for the government
8552137 the last thing i wanted to have here is being vindicated in this way but the point here is at least its high time to open your eyes and see what we are dealing with
8552138 i believe our people is consolidated as never before on that point russia has grossly miscalculated the point here is its not about me any more the nation has got more mature democracy will become more vibrant and the long term effect will be exactly the opposite to what they intended
8552139 people are now outraged with russia it greatly strengthens saakashvilis position internationally no question but domestically as well
8552140 his political situation has been shored up inadvertently perhaps by this russian move
8552141 i hope the international community will not limit itself only to statements but will shift to real action soon
8552142 but the time will come when the georgian society will start to ask them questions about what has happened to our country
8552143 the police are in a tough position if they bring in armor or anything like that to crash a gate its going to look like the september 2006 coup times three
8552144 the logical non violent solution would be simply to seal off the area and deny them any food and water
8552145 we dont want all out war with russia theres no question of launching an all out war against russia
8552146 the question though for russia is whether it wants to suffer the isolation the loss of respect and the loss of trust that comes from that
8552147 the russian response has been to invade a neighboring country
8552148 after thorough consideration it would be too dangerous to do so
8552149 ive told the police not to break up the crowd but to encourage people to leave
8552150 we wont leave government house as ordered by the civil court
8552151 our demands remain the same to have the government resign and to prevent an amendment of the 2007 constitution
8552152 as the police have so far shown restraint and resisted efforts to disperse the crowd by force and shoulder the consequences the pad is pinning its hopes on some men in green sharing its goal of toppling the government
8552153 samak would love to do a 1976 and go in and shoot them all down thats his style but the police desperately dont want that to happen because it would really do no good to anybody

8552272 i think its fair to say that many if not most women these days dont settle for smooth political speak when it comes to their health care needs
8552273 we are so pleased that the health insurance advocate show is predominately listened to by women because national health care will absolutely take away many important aspects of the american health care system women have come to rely on lets see how many american women are willing to wait six months for a mammogram if obama care starts
8552274 there is no doubt that the health insurance advocate radio show is a compelling one of kind program
8552275 listeners are attracted to the health insurance advocate show in part because with todays current political discussion surrounding national health care they want to be informed by someone who knows the facts forward and backward not someone who is hoping to gain votes

8552307 me and symantec are like me and fords we just dont get along
8552308 ive had bad experiences with their virus protection products in the past and wouldnt you know soon after i started at baja users were coming to me with infections that symantec had missed
8552309 we were experiencing difficulties on a number of workstations that symantec just wasnt resolving so i needed to find a new solution fast
8552310 our licenses were running out so the timing was good i really didnt want to spend more money on protection that wasnt working
8552311 we were paying so much for our symantec licenses i couldnt believe that the free edition of avg caught the problems that symantec didnt
8552312 as soon as i installed the software it identified the virus that had been causing us trouble and then found three more
8552313 i needed a quote quickly so that i could get the new protection in place before our symantec license ran out and left us with even less protection
8552314 we wanted to get avg up and running as soon as possible to make sure the network stayed virus free
8552315 i searched online for avg suppliers and found walling data
8552316 i liked the idea of working with them because theyre relatively close to us in north carolina i was also impressed with the range of support options they offered an important aspect when youre dealing as i was with distributed networks and a brand new product
8552317 what do i like most about avg well it just seems to work
8552318 after dealing with the hassles of symantec avg was a welcome change for baja broadband and walling datas assistance made the whole process very easy
8552319 honestly everything happened so efficiently when we purchased our licenses i had no need for support
8552320 the initial installation was completely trouble free but i may well give them a call and talk through a few options for tweaking the system when i get a moment

8552332 jack stole my heart the minute i saw his sad brown eyes whenever he would come out of his kennel to go outside he would come and sit in front of me with his head down to be petted he would follow me around the courtyard and would accompany me as i worked in the boarding area
8552333 since jack was too sick to be sent to maine with his sister and the other shelter dogs i decided that if i could find an apartment that allowed dogs i would adopt him as luck would have it i found a beautiful house where jack would be welcome and on the very day that the other foster dogs were put on the transport truck headed to maine i adopted him
8552334 jack is now two years old and recently had his annual exam for his vaccinations he still sees the veterinarian who saved him when he was so sick and she gave him a clean bill of health he is heartworm free and has no lasting damage to his heart i am thrilled that our time together will be much longer than anyone originally thought

8552341 scientists have known for years yams contain high amounts of steroidal glycosides which are naturally occurring steroid alkaloids
8552342 listen some oranges contain 30 mg of vitamin c others contain over 300 mgs whos to say the trelawny yam isnt just chock full of natural steroids and if you eat enough of them you will get a steroid like effect
8552343 the problem for scientists is that we could never liberate all those powerful steroid alkaloids and make them usable until now
8552344 we just got finished with a clinical trial study on naturally occurring steroidal glycosides and the results were staggering
8552345 what we were able to do is cleave the sugar molecule off the steroidal glycoside and liberate its enormous nitrogen retaining effect
8552346 and as everybody knows steroids dramatically increase nitrogen in the muscle cell making it bigger stronger and faster
8552347 im using it on some of my pro ball players and theyre getting huge steroid like results with no steroid side effects some of them are getting so big and strong their agents have phoned me swearing up and down im giving them real juice i had one young player who gained 13 pounds of muscle in 30 days and lowered his 60 yard dash time by 3 seconds

8552356 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8552357 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8552358 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8552359 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8552360 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8552361 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8552362 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8552363 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes

8552402 we are going to be forced to do this serve summons on the fund this affects not only our firms but also members of the public
8552403 these are all settled matters we are usually paid within a week or 10 days but since this traverso judgment we have not received one we have received only promises of payment
8552404 we now have no choice but to issue summons take judgment and attach goods we can claim interest back dated to the day of the accident this is an abuse of public funds
8552405 although we cannot say much at the moment the attack bears the hallmarks of a hit by people who exactly knew their target
8552406 before aarto was introduced a person was arrested when they drove in excess of 50km h over the speed limit aarto has reduced that to 40

8552408 this legislation will empower the minister to make regulations enabling the suspension of a driving licence
8552409 weve really got to roll back the death rate on our roads
8552410 we have one of the highest road death rates in the world and even our own statistics are ropey because we tend to measure road deaths in terms of people who died on the scene
8552411 we estimate that around 17 000 people die on our roads each year
8552412 there is a challenge there getting convictions is proving very difficult
8552413 we really need to work much more effectively with the judiciary magistrates courts in particular

8552419 dat komt omdat er te veel is beloofd en te weinig geleverd er is een pretentie geschapen alsof de staat verantwoordelijk is voor jouw en mijn geluk alsof er een samenleving mogelijk zou zijn met nul risico het leidt tot een duffer nederland en de terreur van de middelmaat daar moeten we vanaf

8552454 against the backdrop of the drumbeat of negative news of the last several weeks it was encouraging to see a little bit of positive news the basic fact of the matter is that although the economy has been weak it hasnt fallen off a cliff
8552455 the weakness in the dollar and the strength in u s exports are acting like a bit of an automatic stabilizer for the u s economy
8552456 its a key offset at a time when other things are not so good

8552471 the court finds that the ordinance as written is too ambiguous to be enforceable
8552472 we feel this ordinance regulates quality of life issues which are of ultimate importance to residents in our unincorporated areas
8552473 our intent was not to put any catering trucks out of business but to ensure fairness to our residents those who live in homes right in front of or across the street from where trucks do business everyday all hours of the day or night
8552474 if you cant manage your restaurant business in a way so that you can compete with a taco truck maybe you should find another business
8552475 this law hurt us it favors some businesses over others and makes a hardworking person into a delinquent
8552476 the plan is to consult with court managers to determine in each court what is the best way we can achieve the savings we need while having the least impact on public access to the courts
8552477 the kinds of questions were asking are should all the courts be closed the same half day each week does it make sense to have some courts closed at different times were pretty much into that kind of micro planning at the moment
8552478 its definitely not going to be to anybodys advantage to close it everything will just get backed up i dont think its such a good idea
8552479 we dont have any illusions in the judicial branch about the somewhat pessimistic economic news that were facing
8552480 the court system knows that it needs to participate with everyone else in government and with all vermonters in identifying ways to make it through this tough time
8552481 theres nothing about the tests that is designed to create anxiety or create a sense of evaluation or create a sense of being compared to someone else
8552482 once the information is available the potential exists for school administrators to use it to track students and make premature assessments
8552483 were teaching kids how to get the right answers not how to find the knowledge
8552484 what prosecutors oftentimes want is an admission on the part of the public official and resignation
8552485 its a significant bargaining chip that he has if hes already removed from office then that certainly could have a possible impact on the plea negotiations
8552486 if he wants to leave the criminal cases he is going to need to do it before the removal is resolved
8552487 or you take your chances by going through the removal proceedings you fight that fight and see what happens
8552488 there are public officials who survive these trials and continue in office
8552489 there also are public officials who fight their cases get convicted and serve more time in jail than they would have if they had pleaded guilty or resigned
8552490 the governor is the sole tribunal in removal proceedings with no right of appeal or review afforded the accused

8552504 fears and aspirations of the south ossetian and abkhazian peoples
8552505 the continued russian presence in georgia outside of abkhazia and south ossetia for example in poti represents a significant violation of the six point plan agreement
8552506 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure
8552507 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm at that point were expecting it to be a category 3 hurricane

8552510 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8552511 it is great to see the court confirm that the dmca protects services like youtube that follow the law and respect copyrights youtube has gone above and beyond the law to protect content owners while empowering people to communicate and share their experiences online
8552512 napster nsdq naps existed solely to provide the site and facilities for copyright infringement and its control over its system was directly intertwined with its ability to control infringing activity by contrast veohs right and ability to control its system does not equate to the right and ability to control infringing activity unlike napster there is no suggestion that veoh aims to encourage copyright infringement on its system and there is no evidence that veoh can control what content users choose to upload before it is uploaded unlike napster whose index was comprised entirely of pirated material veohs ability to control its index does not equate to an ability to identify and terminate infringing videos for the most part the files in question did not bear titles resembling plaintiffs works and io did not provide veoh with its titles to search

8552522 a cowardly act by the enemies of the people of afghanistan
8552523 such attacks will not deter the process of international assistance to afghanistan

8552525 we are routinely approached by writers and filmmakers interested in telling the facebook story or the stories of the more than 100 million people who use facebook to share and make the world more open and connected at this point we have not agreed to cooperate with any film project but we are flattered by the interest
8552526 welcome im aaron sorkin i understand there are a few other people using facebook pages under my name which i find more flattering than creepy but this is me i dont know how i can prove that but feel free to test me

8552530 its like jennifer is on nothing less than a revenge tour while in the past the californian beauty shunned publicity and shrank from photographers lenses now shes openly encouraging the attention smiling showing off her body and creating photo ops since john said it was he who broke off their four month romance jennifer has kept a stiff upper lip and let her actions do the talking making sure everyone sees her smiling and looking sexy
8552531 jennifer was glowing smiling and being very friendly as she ate tuna tartare rock shrimp and spinach salad with a glass of wine it was hard to believe this was a woman who just broke up with her boyfriend
8552532 the cameras didnt change our behaviour at all except simon had to wear his pyjamas
8552533 we came to respect what the programme makers wanted to do show that behind the closed door aspect of family life how things are resolved the love thats there in that family life
8552534 also its a fantastic thing to pass on to later generations of the hughes
8552535 we were not trying to find a family that symbolises britain because no family can do that
8552536 but we didnt want to find the partridge family the extremes because theres enough drama conflict resolution without that
8552537 isolation the loss of respect and the loss of trust
8552538 i thought it was very important at this stage to say to friendly countries like the ukraine that we were determined to support their democratic choices
8552539 the point i want to underline above all others is that whats happened since the collapse of the soviet union is not a western plot
8552540 its a series of decisions by independent sovereign democracies about the course that they want to take not a course of confrontation with russia but a course of engagement with the west which i think is wholly within their rights and is something weve been right to support
8552541 we dont accept that the choice for ukraine is that either you are an enemy of russia or you are a vassal of russia you can be a partner of the west you can be a partner of russia
8552542 its right to talk about an international crisis theres no question of launching an all out war against russia
8552543 we are in a situation which marks a clear end to the relative and growing calm in and around europe since the collapse of the soviet union
8552544 the last 15 or so years have seen a period in which europes borders have been clearly demarcated new nations have come out of the old soviet union theyve joined the european union
8552545 and the european countries have enjoyed a period of unprecedented stability i think that the danger that arises from russian actions is that that period comes to an end
8552546 we the foreign ministers of canada france germany italy japan the united states and the united kingdom condemn the action of our fellow g8 member
8552547 i wouldnt agree that we really have a threat of a new cold war russia was is and will continue to be the last country in the world that would want a repeat of the cold war
8552548 the most important thing was to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe

8552572 besonders interessant sind beide produkte im hinblick auf die kommende abgeltungssteuer
8552573 die anlagenwert hamburg mit ihrer langj hrigen erfahrung und ihrem umfangreichen kundenstamm ist f r uns ein idealer partner der kompetenz und vertriebs know how auf den punkt bringt
8552574 der weitere ausbau der gemeinsamen aktivit ten ist bereits f r die nahe zukunft geplant
8552575 die verunsicherung und die gro en ngste in der bev lkerung zeigen dass die information der ffentlichen hand rund um die geplante gesundheitsreform leider versagt hat wir werden die ergebnisse der umfrage zum anlass nehmen und redaktionell noch mehr informationen ber die geplante gesundheitsreform anbieten dar ber hinaus laden wir alle ffentlichen einrichtungen und auch die rzteschaft ein sich via medscreen an dieser dringend notwendigen informationsarbeit zu beteiligen
8552576 f r die rzte sollte dabei alarmierend sein dass fast die h lfte aller befragten das wartezimmer als wesentlich mitentscheidend daf r bezeichnen ob sie einen arzt weiterempfehlen bzw erneut besuchen alle rzte sind also gut beraten der ausstattung ihrer wartezimmer mehr aufmerksamkeit zu widmen
8552577 gemeinsam wollen wir mehr atmosph re und ruhe in die arztpraxen bringen wei e w nde und gestaltungschaos sollen aus den wartezimmern verbannt werden
8552578 einnahmen der autobahngesellschaft asfinag weiterhin ausschlie lich f r die finanzierung des hochrangigen stra ennetzes verwendet werden sollen
8552579 wir werden uns jedenfalls sehr gut merken was sp und vp versprochen haben beispielsweise dass die autofahrer in den n chsten jahren nicht mit einer kilometerabh ngigen pkw maut rechnen m ssen
8552580 wir werden die politiker an ihren taten messen und auf die einhaltung von versprechen aus dem wahlkampf pochen
8552581 die sp plant mit ihrer vorgehensweise die k rntner krankenanstalten wieder voll unter den roten einfluss zu bringen dabei ist rohr und kaiser jedes mittel recht und alle demokratischen hemmungen werden fallen gelassen
8552582 kaiser und rohr verwechseln den kabeg aufsichtsrat mit dem k rntner landtag die sp soll ihren wahlkampf dort f hren wo er gef hrt werden kann n mlich in den politischen gremien aber nicht in den unabh ngigen gremien des gr ten unternehmens k rntens
8552583 weder die landesaufsicht noch die verfassungsabteilung konnten jedoch eine gesetzwidrige vorgangsweise feststellen deshalb versucht man jetzt den unweg ber die politischen gremien
8552584 f r eine bestimmte wegstrecke soll unabh ngig vom einkommen derselbe betrag zustehen
8552585 besonders wichtig sind jetzt aber eine steuerpolitik die alle arbeitnehmer innen entlastet und eine lohnpolitik die den wohlstandszuwachs gerecht verteilt
8552586 so ist zum beispiel unklar wie viele preis nderungen das wort h ufig beinhaltet das im papier als definition verwendet wird

8552589 plassnik hat jede volksabstimmung ber den eu vertrag abgelehnt plassnik hat die ber 15 000 k rntnerinnen und k rntner die f r mehr direkte demokratie unterschrieben haben einfach ignoriert und plassnik steht jeder eu kommissar in br ssel n her als die k rntnerinnen und k rntner mit ihren sorgen und problemen

8552592 die eu kommission muss die heute pr sentierte studie von global 2000 und greenpeace aus der hervorgeht dass die eu weit g ltige h chstmengenregelung f r pestizide gesundheitlich schwer bedenklich ist zum anlass nehmen die entsprechende eu verordnung unter die lupe zu nehmen und zu reformieren s mtliche h chstwerte sind im sinne des vorsorgeprinzips zu bewerten und alle gesundheitlich bedenklichen h chstmengen sofort herabzusetzen
8552593 bisher wurden in sterreich trotz zunehmender mehrfachr ckst nde bei pestiziden keine summengrenzwerte festgesetzt wurden
8552594 die in der sch dlingsbek mpfungs h chstwerteverordnung festgelegten h chstwerte wurden massiv berschritten im jahr 2006 wurden bei 662 durchgef hrten proben in 47 7 1 f llen die zul ssigen h chstgrenzen berschritten die gr te anzahl an h chstwert berschreitungen ist bei kopfsalat zu verzeichnen
8552595 die abgeordneten haben sich nicht von der panikmache der chemie und agrarlobby anstecken lassen
8552596 gesundheitspolitik rangiert zwar ganz unten auf der beliebtheitsskala der politiker in vorwahlzeiten ist aber zweifellos eines der brennenden themen in den jahren nach der wahl
8552597 wir erwarten uns daher auch eine spannende und sicherlich kontroverse diskussion die dem titel
8552598 wie die umsetzungspl ne dann aussehen hat uns die j ngst gescheiterte gro e koalition bewiesen
8552599 bedarf unser europaweit bestes gesundheitssystem dann berhaupt neuer strukturen oder gen gt eine neuordnung der finanzierung welche ma nahmen zur st rkung des vergleichsweise preiswerten niedergelassenen bereichs gibt es ist ein neuerlicher anlauf f r eine gesundheitsreform ohne miteinbeziehung des station ren bereiches also ausschlie lich im bereich der niedergelassenen rztinnen und rzte denkbar

8552603 ich mache aber sicher keine geheimtuscheleien geredet wird koaliert nicht

8552608 their focussed tourism plan and inspection would help us to assess whether the sectors national development initiatives could meet the challenge
8552609 we are still overstretched by the inspection work of the tourism product and service standards
8552610 i have much knowledge of our countrys history and in my view i think there is much that went wrong and must be corrected that is why i want rwandans to vote for me and i join my brains with others in building our nation
8552611 rwanda got independence but never got liberated until rpf intervened and liberated the country from then on lots of efforts are needed to rebuild the country that is why i put civic education of youths on top of my campaigning agenda
8552612 i personally witnessed the genocide though i was helpless by then however whoever took part in it should be punished none of them should escape justice
8552613 i managed to get 650 signatures from my close friends only i was able to get as many delegates as possible and i am sure getting 200 000 votes wont be a challenge to me
8552614 my first expectation is that i will enter parliament with over 5 percent threshold my second expectation is that many people who support laws of this country will have a seat in parliament alongside me given this some steps toward development can be taken in rwanda
8552615 in order to be able to create firm areas of work it is necessary to encourage local and foreign investors and the public sector to boost their investments
8552616 it is not money that is going to take me to parliament neither am i going there to work for money its rwandans that will decide on taking me to parliament or not and when i happen to get there i will be serving them not making money
8552617 there is nothing as this kind of democratic maturity anywhere in africa
8552618 in africa we are still at the abc stage of democratic development
8552619 by senator clinton endorsing senator obama is a very strong lesson to africa that election political opponents are not enemies as it has happened in so many african countries
8552620 we have set up a two fold strategy on communication and public awareness strategy the target audiences include secondary and higher learning institutions companies and civil society organizations
8552621 we want to make sure all issues are known to the public the leaders who craft programs need to know what the citizens as end users think and their expectations from the east african political federation
8552622 there are many blocks and they are in the congo regretfully we cannot dictate terms the final control of the rebels we feel will come from the drc government we will need to talk to them
8552623 we have always insisted that the way forward must lie in the political process and the objective is clear to restore state authority in the drc
8552624 is the rwanda government satisfied no simply because we would like to have all our citizens back and out of the jungles of the drc
8552625 the conditions for repatriating these people are in place and a number of them have been fully re integrated into leadership positions
8552626 this is the moment and we have to continue we are optimistic but have to underline that it will take time
8552627 it will require time and effort we cannot give you guarantees
8552628 it is not a political problem but a judicial issue
8552629 we are ready to start working 24 hours seven days a week by september 1
8552630 as usual through our collaborative efforts uganda ura and the sister revenue authorities will be meeting soon to develop a framework for the smooth operation of this arrangement the actual time frame i cannot determine at this point
8552631 such 24 hour services will benefit the business community by providing quick access to the market and reduce transport costs due to decrease of transportation time
8552632 few parents and schools buy reading books for their children this is therefore one of the ways through which we can persuade our young generation to read and write
8552633 rwanda offers an opportunity of using three languages in this competitive world one with three languages will compete better than those with fewer languages children should thus use the opportunity to learn all the three national languages and also use their reading skills to improve their grammar and vocabulary
8552634 i think reading is a principal way to success and i believe students should read hard in order to pass exams highly

8552655 if you reduce uric acid at least in some patients you may be able to reduce blood pressure
8552656 this could be one way people develop hypertension and may allow us to develop new therapies
8552657 this is far from being a reasonable therapeutic intervention for high blood pressure but these findings indicate a first step in understanding the pathway of the disease
8552658 you cannot prevent a disease until you know the cause this study is way of finding that out
8552659 the antihypertensive therapies available to patients are well proven and safe
8552660 currently available antihyperuricemic therapies treatments that lower uric acid are not safe enough to be used as first line therapy for most people with high blood pressure
8552661 the cane toads cannot survive in much of southern australia because they would be too cold to move about and forage or spawn
8552662 we found that cane toads can barely hop once they get below about 15 degrees celsius
8552663 their range would also be constrained by the limited availability of water for their tadpoles in some parts of australia
8552664 these are perfect conditions for growing wine but you are unlikely to meet a toad at a winery
8552665 our study is particularly helpful in predicting where cane toads could live under climate change because we have identified a cause and effect way that climate limits the toads
8552666 in one way it is obvious why dry conditions are bad for frogs they lose too much water
8552667 but having wet skin also provides frogs with a thermal challenge because the evaporating water takes heat away from their bodies and often makes them colder than the air

8552679 living systems are intrinsically robust against cells dying or being damaged
8552680 the behaviour of most organs is an emerging feature resulting from the interaction of many cells where no cell is particularly robust or even aware of the whole behaviour
8552681 the starting point in winsoc was to provide mathematical models of biological systems and translate them into algorithms to determine how the sensor nodes should interact with each other
8552682 our indian partners have buried sensors in the terrain with the capability of monitoring the humidity and porosity of the terrain and the acceleration forces
8552683 the sensors are then linked to a satellite which gathers the data and conveys them to the control centre
8552684 the first is related to the monitoring of the earth with a system capable of autonomous decisions
8552685 this is particularly important in remote areas where it is difficult to recharge batteries or replace defective nodes
8552686 we believe that cross fertilisation of ideas from biology to engineering and vice versa can provide substantial benefits to both areas

8552715 our exploration activity this year is very high both on the ncs and internationally the new discoveries illustrate the scope of our exploration efforts which include both known and immature provinces
8552716 the oil discovery at sleipner represents a highlight in this years exploration programme on the ncs and it is encouraging that we now at the start of the big ons event in stavanger may demonstrate that new ideas prove successful in a part of the north sea that has been explored since the 1960s
8552717 this is a very exciting discovery the sleipner area is still very prospective and this well confirms that there is also a good chance of making oil discoveries in this area
8552718 the discovery is a result of focused efforts to find more hydrocarbons that may be phased in to sleipner i will credit my exploration organisation for coming up with the idea that there might be an oil column below the gas at dagny which was discovered 30 years ago
8552719 i am pleased that the result met with our expectations and that dry gas was confirmed in a reservoir with good reservoir qualities

8552732 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november barack obama knows that america cannot be strong abroad unless we are strong at home people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power but first we have to elect him
8552733 i was very very satisfied with the performance of every player even without players like essien mensah and muntari who are big players the rest played for the nation
8552734 i liked the spirit of the team and we have a big group that we can make selections from that was an important for me to see them play
8552735 that is good news i am happy because the work we started is still going on well the team has done a lot within this short time i like the character of the team
8552736 i was happy with what i saw against tanzania and this week everyone would know my team we missed some regular players there game against tanzania but this is a big game and we expect to have everyone available

8552738 thats match with libya a game i want to win its very important that we win that game and i would put in everything to make it happen
8552739 i have watched the first game and you know they were good they are quick and aggressive but we have to vary our tactics too
8552740 i have spoken to technical people who have seen the libyans too and i must work around what i have seen been told and anything that happens on the day as things can change in football
8552741 its a big game for ghana and also for me i am hopeful of a positive result and thats what i would set up my team to achieve
8552742 seeing phil and john as hardened criminals working on the other side of the law will no doubt take devoted life on mars fans by surprise joining them as the other two jewel thieves in their crew are ashley walters and cristian solimeno and the dynamic between all four actors is terrific to watch weve a great ensemble cast with kate magowan and dylan brown along with kevin mcnally kirsty mitchell and linal haft

8552752 im not giving a lesson on accountancy but you do write money off over the term of a contract
8552753 what we pay is in an investment during that period you have a player who is doing a job and in this industry you buy and sell players
8552754 you have to look at these things pragmatically sometimes these things dont work as well as you want them to
8552755 remember we got deco for 8million and that looks to be the buy of the season
8552756 the risk of where this whole structure inside of glassware of gas bottles of rubber tubes where a naked flame could be near them and activate them just shows how stupid these people are
8552757 the chemicals concerned are subject to explosiveness and the smell of the putridness of this type of material can harm people
8552758 its probably for the best that she doesnt go there anymore
8552759 he seemed like a nice enough person but you just dont know what could be going on next door anymore
8552760 we wanted to refer him to a hospital in dhaka but the family was so poor that they could not afford to take him there so they took him home where he died

8552767 the american dream is under siege at home and americas leadership in the world has been weakened

8552769 i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country
8552770 my mothers creed is the american creed no one is better than you
8552771 you are everyones equal and everyone is equal to you
8552772 together vice president cheney donald rumsfeld and john mccain brought more than a century of experience to our foreign policy challenges
8552773 and what did that get us one international debacle after another
8552774 we deserve better than john mccains jokes about bombing iran or his denials that iraq has distracted us from afghanistan
8552775 when i returned from iraq i realized we didnt just need change over there we also needed to change how we treat our veterans here at home
8552776 for eight long years weve had a president who rushed to stand with soldiers at political rallies but abandoned them at walter reed weve had a president who spent billions on private contractors but not on body armor for all our troops
8552777 for the past eight years the man in the oval office has tipped his hat over his eyes kicked back his chair and snoozed at his desk while his vice president conspired with oil industry cronies
8552778 youve come here from so many different places having made this journey and feeling in your heart what is right for you to do
8552779 yes we didnt make it but boy did we have a good time
8552780 afghanistan we dont read about it anymore because its succeeded
8552781 lots of times the law doesnt work for poor people and this is a prime example
8552782 we didnt know nor did we condone the practice of our employees charging parents for field trips as a condition of attending those events
8552783 this settlement reimbursement will close the door on this chapter of the concerns of parents of h b wilson
8552784 gov corzine has clearly expressed that he would like to see this issue resolved as quickly as possible through the legal system
8552785 it affords us adequate opportunity to brief the issues and to address the merits or lack thereof of the governors arguments
8552786 i cant even believe what a great feeling that must be to walk away with that trophy
8552787 they announced us as national champions and everybody stayed it was one of those years you dont want to forget
8552788 some of them seem so shy so backwards but by the time they complete their years in marching band you just see them blossom
8552789 if you come in last and know you did your best thats all you can ask
8552790 oh yeah you want to have the attitude youre going to smack everyone around and steal their trophies
8552791 this is a show that if you put it in the right hands can win a championship its all about the execution
8552792 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama
8552793 that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8552794 the constitution sets qualifications for the president and then the people decide who they think would be the better president
8552795 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for
8552796 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8552797 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
8552798 and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8552799 the selection of a running mate he hit it out of the park
8552800 they actually want us to reward them for the last eight years by giving them four more
8552801 lets send them a message that will echo from the rockies all across america thanks but no thanks in this case the third time is
8552802 we are committed to protecting the shore and its visitors and will prosecute to the full extent of the law anyone found to have violated our criminal statutes by dumping this waste in the ocean
8552803 thats the section of beach where we had a massive beach fill done in late june if theres anything floating in the water its going to come up there
8552804 remember were talking about less than 10 percent of the entire beachfront
8552805 we believe we are the only ones in the country doing something like this on this level

8552808 i heard that your husband was deployed and i thought i could give you a break and bring over dinner
8552809 when she came to us initially we thought she was just going to lend us her name
8552810 but it turns out that she was a volunteer who got down into the trenches with us to fund raise
8552811 she was always there rooting you on no matter what no matter whether it was for an exam or at a football game
8552812 it was joe the boys and the state of delaware
8552813 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time
8552814 i was just in paris and i was thrilled to see their program and all the bikes on the street
8552815 the potential is there to turn philadelphia into an incredible bicycling city an incredible green city
8552816 renting for one day costs as much as joining for one year
8552817 i go back and forth from my office to court now i can rent one of these
8552818 we knew it would be something that we could get to work within the district and by including it in the contract we didnt have to pay for it
8552819 smartbike is intended to provide riders with the missing link between existing points of public transportation and desired destinations
8552820 there are plenty of bike shops where tourists can go and rent bikes

8552822 if there was a way for tourists to sign up that would improve it
8552823 residents nonresidents businesspeople students tourists anybody who can ride a bicycle
8552824 det er nyttig lese harmdirrende moralleksjoner om serbiske masseovergrep p 1990 tallet skrevet av norske eller amerikanske papirintellektuelle men ville det ikke blitt mer eksplosiv litteratur dersom krigsforbryter radovan karadzic f 1945 fikk utbasunere sitt usminkede forsvar for etnisk rensing er ikke historien mer utfordrende sett fra taperens st sted

8552834 the beauty of this and the adjustment of the fees is that everybody who is eligible gets a place theres none of this where some people pay 877 and other people pay 8000 a year for full private cost recovery
8552835 its demand driven more will participate and the level of skills in the community will increase
8552836 some fees will stay the same and others will rise in line with the expected job opportunities and wage outcomes from engaging in one of those qualifications

8552840 confirmed every one of my fears and concerns it is apparent that in your desire to reduce the size of government you have no problem sacrificing education
8552841 es un indicio desafortunado de que el cambio clim tico est ocurriendo r pidamente en el artico y que realmente debemos analizar el tema del calentamiento global a nivel nacional
8552842 este fue un verano relativamente fr o y el descenso del hielo al segundo m nimo registrado demuestra el profundo impacto del calentamiento global
8552843 its very hard to get it to be the primary issue particularly for politicians who are making budget decisions because they are not getting the same pressure about mental health as they get about cancer and coronary disease and diabetes
8552844 we working from the opportunity we have within government organizations such as the national association and the nova scotia association and other groups and all of us collectively need to be doing something much more significant to make this a burning bridge issue for decision makers
8552845 we are looking at the final frontier of socially acceptable discrimination
8552846 in the view of most canadians mental health is not given the priority it ought to have within the health care system
8552847 copper production has shown a steady improvement over the first half of the year and we continue to anticipate that production of copper from our own material for 2008 will be at least in line with last year

8552851 admission of alcohol into the event site will be limited to 48 cans per person please consume alcohol in moderation
8552852 we have a responsibility not to live in a self centred way and to realise that the way were living can have a detrimental effect in other countries
8552853 we try to practice what we preach too which can be hard
8552854 often people get so taken up with their own affairs
8552855 but we should all try to do the best we can where we can
8552856 i cant help but think it will hurt the future prosperity of this community not to have an educational system we can brag about
8552857 we really want to encourage young people and families to attend heritage events
8552858 and it is great to see such enthusiasm for finding out more about irelands wildlife
8552859 braon in said that he looked forward to welcoming as many parents as possible that can come along with their children on saturday next
8552860 although children will be starting on monday september 1 we wanted to give their parents an opportunity to see for themselves where their children will be attending school
8552861 people have worked so hard to get us to this stage
8552862 we look forward to this being our final step towards a full and permanent site after the next three years he said
8552863 this is the third exhibition that has been held in the gallery in abbeyleix its a marvellous space and it is fast becoming the centre of the art and culture life in the county we have an arts space that is the envy of everyone in the county if not the country
8552864 ben looked at the women through the ages through to the iconic and fantasy depictions of them
8552865 lynda looked on the whole nature of motherhood while helen examined women in the community
8552866 the theme if changing identity of women in society and comparing them in regard to the cultures and religions over the last 20 years was something that we found very interesting
8552867 i love painting and would encourage anyone to try it even if they did not consider themselves artistic i feel i learn something after every painting i complete which makes me strive to produce improved work
8552868 the overall cost in reality could be in excess of 1 billion
8552869 this week professor drumm will make his first official visit to laois since his appointment as ceo of the hse over three years ago despite presiding over an organisation which makes decisions that affect laois people every day professor drumm has yet to officially visit a hse run venue in the county
8552870 the people of laois have been through a very difficult time recently in respect of our local health services
8552871 the hse is funded by the taxpayer and a degree of transparency is absolutely essential
8552872 the questions i have compiled reflect the concerns of people throughout co laois in respect of their local health services
8552873 it was while i was at the national ploughing championships in 2006 that i saw a demonstration of the sport
8552874 they were signing up people for trials so i decided to put my name down six months later i was called up since then i havent looked back
8552875 ive taken part in competitions in france and at the royal welsh show ive also gone on training camps to holland and to germany i will also be taking part in the european champion ships in austria two weeks before the world championships in kilkenny
8552876 i never did it before seeing the demonstration in 2006 its a fairly new sport in ireland its a huge sport in canada new zealand and in australia
8552877 i dont really have any fitness programme the work i do keeps me fit id say its all down to practice we also have a british coach spike milton that comes over to us for weekend training camps
8552878 i wear protective chain mail socks under light runners i find them particularly useful when taking part in axe racing competitions there has been one or two near misses when ive taken the top of my runner off but the chain mesh socks have stood up to the test
8552879 the sport is all about getting the best time as possible
8552880 sometimes i rub a bit of wd40 on them others rub grease on their axe heads but its debatable whether or not that frees up the axe to give you the extra time needed in competitions
8552881 along the river walk five weeping willow trees have been hacked down two cordyline palm trees that had been planted in 1999 were also chopped down up further in the park we had just installed a 3 000 recycling unit for compost which we had won in a competition from laois county council and that was utterly demolished
8552882 about two years ago we had a similar problem with someone hacking down trees at that time we thought it was a meat clever being used our fear now is that person is back and we dont know what to expect in the future
8552883 its incredible to think anyone at such an early hour of the morning could carry out such sheer wanton vandalism and an orgy of destruction
8552884 my son brings his two children up here to the park to play its frightening to think someone could do something like this
8552885 i am totally disgusted at what has happened the mountrath development association mda is a very small committee and has put a lot of time and effort into this park for community and for its children
8552886 it is nothing but total vandalism that took place here someone knows who did this and id call on anyone who may have information to contact any member of the association on the garda
8552887 this pollution has been caused by the illegal disposal of oil or grease poured down drains and gullies in kilminchy estate from public and or private places
8552888 the epa was very anxious for us to do something someone has to know what or who is causing this pollution and it might jog someones consciousness to know that something untoward is happening to the water
8552889 we are asking the public to assist us in trying to find out who or what is causing this i can assure you prosecutions will follow if we can identify who is causing the pollution
8552890 there has been a continuous problem on the lakes we have carried out a number of investigations and some prosecutions are pending in relation to earlier finds of contaminates in the water we identified a number of sources where earlier oil spills had come from
8552891 however the latest fat and grease found in the water may be a bit more difficult to trace back to its origins
8552892 as well as that recent oil spills may also be difficult to pinpoint and may very well have come from someone changing their car oil in the estate with the oil flowing down into the gullies
8552893 provide end users a direct connection and voice to the kernel community
8552894 learn and interact with leaders from within the linux community including the highest level maintainers and developers
8552895 i never remembered having as much fun as i am right now
8552896 they are people who have been through what youve been through they know what its like to be depressed
8552897 the programme was set up and the blue book written by people who have suffered from mental illness
8552898 it gives you a reason to get up even if its just to go for a swim every morning
8552899 it makes you realise that you can do what ordinary people do
8552900 its really a very practical programme but often people dont give it a chance
8552901 i just went to one meeting and i heard them reading from the bible and i just thought this isnt for me and i never went back but this time ive been in the group for over a year
8552902 there are prayers at the meetings but we are non denominational and people get support from whatever their own belief is
8552903 people often dont know how to help you they are almost afraid to talk about it in case it makes you depressed with mental illness youre on your own
8552904 my family do talk to me they ask me how i am and things and that is important
8552905 thats an important point that often people dont know how to help
8552906 but the important thing for someone suffering from mental illness is to talk to someone anyone it doesnt matter who it is
8552907 i dont think there is enough help there for people
8552908 you can just walk in and theyll have a chat with you
8552909 everyone gets a chance to talk no one person is allowed to keep talking for the whole meeting
8552910 sometimes at other groups youd go to one person would just be talking all night
8552911 its an over 18s group and at the moment wed have some young people involved but not many
8552912 people stay in the group as long as they need to and if they do leave they are always free to come back
8552913 the medications im on and grow have really helped me a lot
8552914 that is something which is between the member and their doctor
8552915 youd hug the kid real tight and whisper in his ear kid knock it off or ill throw you out of the park
8552916 the polls when it comes to obama cannot be trusted it is frequently the case that a statistically significant percentage of white voters will lie to pollsters or decline to state their preferences in races in which one candidate is black and the other white
8552917 weve had a defeatist attitude at times when my staff first took over it was almost like the players expected to lose
8552918 i have to change that ive seen a big change since weve been here so far i think weve already made a lot of progress
8552919 as a result some sophomores got playing time before they were ready
8552920 some were thrown to wolves because they had a warm body
8552921 if i didnt think they had an upside i wouldnt be here
8552922 i want them to realize im there for them i think theyve already seen im committed and thats why theyve responded
8552923 its taught me how to deal with different people and different situations
8552924 im really happy with coach maki the way he runs things his whole crew
8552925 when you come into a new program like i did at the meadows the players have to get used to you and the assistants have to get used to you
8552926 we got that out of the way last year and are going to continue that this year
8552927 we always want to compete at the highest level whether that be the 3a or 4a
8552928 that is always the expectation and that wont change winning state is the goal every year the kids believe they can do it and are working hard toward it
8552929 there are a lot of good players in the league but sperry is right up there at the top there is no question about that
8552930 we have some young kids who are really going to have to step up
8552931 we have to get them some experience early in the year and they will be fine
8552932 anybody in the 3a south can beat anybody on any given day
8552933 this is a good group of kids that work hard and is looking to get better
8552934 coach moore brings in a lot of defensive knowledge and im excited to have him as part of the staff
8552935 were faster and more athletic up front we really move to the ball
8552936 going from a wing t to a spread is a lot different but i really like what were going to do
8552937 its not ideal but with just four teams in the league you have to travel a lot
8552938 were going to california twice but i think the trips will be good
8552939 itll make the guys be together and i think itll help the team
8552940 i cant blow that then ive heard you can be 3 9 and state champions but thats not our goal we dont want to be the fourth seed
8552941 we want to play at home in the playoffs its a big advantage we dont want to travel up north in the cold and altitude for a playoff game
8552942 the first thing i wanted to do when i came in was instill in the kids a lunch pail work ethic
8552943 there was a good sense of work ethic before i got here and i just want to take it a step further in general day to day how we go about our business we will work hard every day every rep every down
8552944 we have a very strong defense both our pass defense and rush defense are going to be very good
8552945 we have lot of good talent here if we continue to work hard we think we can make it to the big game in reno
8552946 its important to the kids and coaches to get that first playoff win
8552947 once we get there well do our best to make sure that happens we hope the seniors have an even bigger goal than just winning one playoff game but thats the first step
8552948 there is no doubt in our minds that we are making the playoffs this year
8552949 we are just a better team now other teams wont be able to look past us anymore
8552950 last year we wanted to be the team that got into the win column and we did that this year nobody on our team expects not to win a game
8552951 this year we are more of a team and family
8552952 we are playing for each other there is not one player who is bigger than the team
8552953 we have so many seniors and they want this year to be special
8552954 these kids have stuck through the tough times and now they will be rewarded
8552955 wed like to get the win and get another type of streak started
8552956 weve been to the playoffs before weve played in the big game and it doesnt scare us
8552957 silverado and del sol are the teams to beat with all the other schools right there behind them
8552958 liberty has made some improvements theyre not going to get pushed around this year
8552959 everyone is going to have to take them seriously theyve got some good kids over there
8552960 western didnt really have any kind of offseason conditioning program and thats what ive tried to bring first
8552961 a lot of times they were going off their athleticism we still have good athletes but being a young team this year we want to have accountability with the players
8552962 hes taught us how to play football better and gotten us better conditioned for games
8552963 the kids have to learn to be accountable for everything they do
8552964 they have to have pride in the program and make sure its not just i run fast catch balls and hit hard on the field its getting good grades and showing up to practice because if you dont you wont be on the field
8552965 it doesnt get better than this a national thing with 6 000 teams starting out wanting to be no 1
8552966 last year we kind of went through some growing pains
8552967 last year was just a down year and now people are going to see us get back to where we should be i think this will be a breakout year for a lot of us
8552968 we got a lot better at camp you could see kids improving as they played
8552969 we hope to be pretty balanced on offense this year aaron has a great arm and is a lot more mature we should be able to throw more and that should allow senior running back algernon sewell to pick up some yards
8552970 we should do a lot better this year our receivers have improved a ton algernons in our backfield and i can get comfortable because our line is looking really good theres a lot of excitement on our field right now
8552971 were young on defense but were big up front and very athletic
8552972 we need to get back to playing more disciplined football
8552973 were a more athletic team than we were before these kids take care of business

8552977 go on barry hit it and win us the championship
8552978 i just want to say this was done for se n brennan who could not be here with us today
8552979 this is a long time coming to killeshin and it means so much to us as a team we have been down in the dumps for about 15 years and now we are back here where we belong
8552980 relief 100 relief things were going against us up until that point when the goal went in the heath had a run on us and they were very clever by putting a lot of men behind the ball when the goal went in it was a relief because it kind of opened them up
8552981 an under 14 b medal is all i have won so i have never been in a county final before
8552982 he was probably our best player ever it was an honour to wear the jersey for him too we go up to his grave before every match so this is for him as much as the rest of us
8552983 he sent me a text message this morning to wish me luck so this is for him too
8552984 premiership style but sure look i got the ball and i said i may hit it hard and see where it goes
8552985 they are like engines on the back of the bike
8552986 this isnt just about john its about any player who sustains an injury like this in an off the ball incident

8553009 we do see more foreign fighters now though i think coming to pakistan and operating in afghanistan than were seeing in iraq no intelligence agency would say this but it may be that theres been a refocus i think the al qaida knows that they have blown a movement in iraq through a number of missteps over time
8553010 the influence and the presence and the numbers of al qaida in iraq are very much diminished and they had to go somewhere and my guess is my belief is that they probably have gone to that safe haven in the fata
8553011 thats long been an ungoverned area i think were all concerned that if its not managed and it must be managed by the pakistanis its on their side of the border if its not managed that you could see attacks against other parts of pakistan and certainly attacks into afghanistan
8553012 pakistan is a hard nut to crack and its probably not one that we coalition forces are going to be able to solve its going to require involvement on the part of the pakistanis to settle the problem thats taking place on their sovereign soil

8553018 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8553019 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8553020 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8553021 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8553022 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8553023 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8553024 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8553025 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8553026 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes

8553033 we released our initial red flags program in february 2008 to introduce the topic to our clients and raise awareness of the extensive requirements
8553034 now we are releasing a fully updated version which includes a robust toolkit that provides our clients with all the tools they need to fully comply with the law by november 1st though critically important red flags is really just one more puzzle piece in a continuing good faith effort that should address all pieces of the compliance puzzle compli clients have access to a vast number of critical compliance programs that address legally mandated requirements and they can continue to count on compli to add more programs as the regulations keep coming
8553035 the red flags rule is just one of many compliance obligations imposed on dealers in assisting compli in developing the red flags toolkit we focused on building a resource that would walk dealers through the steps dealers will still need to be thoughtful in their compliance efforts but the toolkit should take much of the stress out of designing and documenting an identity theft prevention program

8553138 what is clear is that b triples have been operating in victoria on victorian roads now for 13 years without incident

8553162 im not against people trying to make living i have a compassion for those folks but at the same time the taxpayers of mississippi shouldnt be subsidizing a plant that wont even hire their own workers
8553163 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
8553164 the union uses the tactic of saying immigration was coming and the members of the union would not be taken

8553166 all them mexicans got fired because they didnt have a pass all these businesses have been taking americans jobs

8553180 the strength in durable goods is just the latest indication that manufacturing is actually holding in quite well and thats a really big plus
8553181 against the backdrop of the drumbeat of negative news of the last several weeks it was encouraging to see a little bit of positive news the basic fact of the matter is that although the economy has been weak it hasnt fallen off a cliff
8553182 the weakness in the dollar and the strength in u s exports are acting like a bit of an automatic stabilizer for the u s economy
8553183 its a key offset at a time when other things are not so good
8553184 a citizen sees the beating in a parking lot police get there fast they see him beating her its a good solid case
8553185 he was on top of her actually in the act of violently beating her when the officers arrived with the knife in his hand
8553186 the victim purposely grabbed the steering wheel and caused the vehicle to hit the curb

8553189 everybody was starting to worry what joe was going to do
8553190 its great news for more than one reason what he brings to the ice everyone knows joe is joe but what he brings to the locker room the respect everybodys so calm when hes around thats what he brings that people dont see
8553191 hes done everything for this organization they told joe take as much time as he needs there will always be a place here for you no pressure
8553192 for sure i was worrying and a bunch of us were worrying about what was going to happen because we know were a much better team when hes in the lineup now that he made the right decision everybodys pumped we know how much better we are when joes in
8553193 if you insist on a quick answer youre probably going to get the answer you dont want if you insist on an answer now it might be no if you give me more time it might be yes
8553194 teams asked if they could at least submit an offer for consideration and joe told me to advise teams not to bother
8553195 peter would like to play if his health will permit him right now hes working on his health issues related to his foot and theres nothing new on that
8553196 it hasnt progressed to the point where were in serious discussions with the team
8553197 even though a soul clings to things of beauty if their beauty is outside god the soul is riveted only upon sorrow
8553198 the true root of evil is selfishness mankind can only get out of its present explosive situation when it realises that selfishness is international it dominates the relationships between individuals groups and countries selfishness must be resisted actively and intelligently first of all within each one of us
8553199 is not the life of man upon earth a trial a continuous trial
8553200 late have i loved you o beauty ever ancient ever new late have i loved you you were within me but i was outside and it was there that i searched for you in my unloveliness i plunged into the lovely things which you created you were with me but i was not with you created things kept me from you yet if they had not been in you they would not have been at all you called you shouted and you broke through my deafness you flashed you shone and you dispelled my blindness you breathed your fragrance on me i drew in breath and now i pant for you i have tasted you now i hunger and thirst for more you touched me and i burned for your peace

8553203 baracks candidacy would not have been conceivable 50 years ago
8553204 kings speech brought about a significant outpouring of support among whites for the idea of civil rights reform and even though obama wants to run as a trans racial candidate his candidacy obviously has enormous symbolic significance
8553205 he has to present himself as the american candidate for president not the african american candidate
8553206 anybody who gives a speech on this kind of occasion speaks in kings shadow and is judged in comparison with him
8553207 thats part of the enormous challenge obama has created for himself for better or worse by happenstance or design he has set the rhetorical bar extraordinarily high
8553208 that speech was the first time many in our generation heard him speak in a coherent consistent way instead of the sound bites that wed been exposed to on the news
8553209 obama is probably the best political speaker weve had since ronald reagan
8553210 hes a highly rational speaker unlike king but at the same time touches people emotionally what gives him his emotional power is his use of the language of transformation obama is able to rise above the particulars of the moment and talk more in universals that can encompass people of many ideologies
8553211 in a sense he needs to do something similar to what king did
8553212 to do what only great orators can do offer a compelling vision of the future thats what great oratory is its not just putting words together its putting the right words to match the historical moment

8553241 people in areas threatened by severe tropical weather can use the new iphone service along with our regular mobile site to keep themselves and their families safe when they dont have access to a computer
8553242 while we are capable of meeting current demand there is a backlog of high priority patients
8553243 in that context the decision to outsource to an australian hospital with the capacity to perform that surgery within the next three months makes sense
8553244 the vehicle was going to pick up prisoners and as it reached a bridge an explosive laden car exploded and nine of our policemen and two passers by were killed
8553245 there were a lot of concerns about how fast the economy was slowing with this strong capital expenditure theres a possibility that the gdp for the second quarter will be better than expected
8553246 the rba may not be as aggressive in its rate cuts

8553248 we know if residents have more one on one attention we wouldnt need as many sedatives
8553249 its better to manage them through reducing the use of tea and coffee and giving hot milky drinks rather than giving sleeping tablets

8553270 two horses in the stable and another in the outbuilding have been found dead two dogs which we believe were in a kennel block are missing
8553271 police have said at a very early stage that this is an arson
8553272 its very unusual for them to do that before fire investigators have been able to get in and investigate the cause of the fire but clearly there are reasons why theyve done that
8553273 buildings that are far apart where you wouldnt have expected a fire to naturally spread have also been destroyed so its clear that there were a number of seats to this fire

8553293 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama
8553294 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job

8553312 according to the abs australian bureau of statistics data today the private capital expenditure rose by a stronger than expected 5 7 per cent in the june 2008 quarter
8553313 i would ask this question why is it that when theres positive economic data out there that those opposite find no reason to embrace that in their argument at all
8553314 it suggest that therell be continued capital expenditure to try and alleviate some of the constraints that have prevailed for several years now so it definitely is a positive thing for medium term inflation
8553315 the opportunity to co locate with the ideal home show was simply too good for us and the overseas property industry to turn down

8553335 this shows who i am a human being i dont even know if america understands how far we have come that we finally can be the america we always says we are
8553336 my mother was right i can be anything i want to be i can be the president of the united states of america
8553337 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side i am so lucky to have known her loved her and been her partner in all things
8553338 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8553339 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8553340 for all of dels life she was an activist and organizer even before we knew what those terms meant
8553341 her last act of public activism was her most personal marrying the love of her life after 55 years
8553342 in the wake of losing her we recognize with heightened clarity the most poignant and responsible way to honor her legacy is to preserve the right of marriage for same sex couples thereby providing the dignity and respect that del and phyllis love deserved

8553347 flashpoint has hit its mark with north american audiences and remained competitive b
8553348 viewers have embraced flashpoint and we are answering their call for more the cast and creative team have delivered a series that not only entertains with high intensity drama but with heart as well
8553349 were excited that canadian audiences have responded with such enthusiasm to flashpoints stories of humanity and adrenaline
8553350 were extremely proud to have this opportunity to bring more of our homegrown stories to viewers in canada and around the world
8553351 you know what it started as a strike aberration and its turned into something terrific
8553352 we have a great relationship with ctv and the producers were very pleased with the numbers and are encouraged and its certainly sort of continuing a trend to look at the world in a very different context there are great formats coming out of different countries as technology improves as far as what foreign content looks like were having a very different dialogue now its a global playground we get you know even writers and directors are bringing product to us from overseas so i think its a really very exciting time as far as exploring all these other opportunities so its a good thing
8553353 congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press
8553354 across the board they the new assessments are too high
8553355 it bothers me when the rules of a game are changed
8553356 all of us basically agree with the taxpayers because were taxpayers too
8553357 we dont adjust the values for being high or low were responsible to make sure that they assessed equal
8553358 last year was obviously very disappointing with the champions league
8553359 thats a trophy i obviously want very badly and hopefully with the squad weve got here weve got a great chance of doing that
8553360 this demonstrates the depth of work that chelsea is doing in the community
8553361 four years ago we had a good look at giving more back and as a football club were all doing that collectively
8553362 dem deutschen fu ball sind in dieser zeit viele abwehrspieler verloren gegangen
8553363 aber es l sst sich doch feststellen dass langsam was nachw chst
8553364 ihn habe ich nicht nur bei spielen sondern auch ein paarmal im training beobachtet
8553365 you have entered a lower tier rvr area do you want to fight fair
8553366 ceci est une nouvelle voie prometteuse dans la recherche des m canismes biologiques responsables de lob sit
8553367 ive missed more than 9000 shots in my career ive lost almost 300 games 26 times ive been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed ive failed over and over and over again in my life and that is why i succeed
8553368 we are sitting very close to a good support level of rs 380 even if we look at this from a long term perspective since 2004 whenever it has come close to a rs 300 310 area it has bounced back in a very good form it has bounced back at least rs 200 so i would expect that overall medium to long term the stock will move higher you could see something like a rs 60 70 increase from the current levels but you need to given at least 6 months in terms of time so keeping rs 370 is a stoploss and i will recommend a hold on
8553369 try not to nerd yourself to death while im gone
8553370 i think if we absorb the kind of price action ongc has shown from around august 12 where it has made its highs at about rs 1 100 1 120 we corrected all the way down to about a rs 1 000 and what i have noticed was all these days had under averaged volumes so what i am trying to say is the price corrected but the volumes were much below average and if we look at that on consistent basis that is the signal that you are approaching a good support and there is no conviction on the sell side
8553371 so between rs 950 1 000 i would say that is the pocket where you need to go and buy keep a stoploss around rs 950 and yes rs 1 100 is a very reasonable target to expect short to medium term if you have to be in this long term this is a stock where it would take a lot more time so one needs to have a time horizon of 1 year to 1 5 years minimum if you are looking this from an investment cycle so i would put a hold on this
8553372 we are not very positive on the entire real estate sector outlook immediately so short term i would say its a definite no dlf is heading to about rs 440 450 somewhere they could find some support even on an intra day basis or on a short term basis i would say that dlf first would have a move downwards if i had to look at this from a long term perspective i would only like to enter at lower levels so at this level absolutely no
8553373 what we shouldnt do is create a climate that makes it harder to attract new investment
8553374 we need 100bn plus in the next 10 years so weve got to create the right framework that encourages investment we must not lose sight of that
8553375 the position on tax is a matter for the chancellor and the treasury the treasury receives a whole range of representations and of course will consider such representations in the normal way
8553376 a legalised raid on the companys bank accounts that would be very unhelpful because it would scare off investors and also could make the cost of investment much higher and in the end that would end up on the customers bills
8553377 the era of cheap energy is over the question is how we are going to adjust to that and what sort of help can we provide to those who are going to struggle the most
8553378 there is genuine concern about the difficulties people will face paying heating bills over the coming winter and we are looking at extra support
8553379 if prices continue to fall at the pace they have done over the past three months they will end the year down 15 percent
8553380 with inflation this means that residential real estate will have lost around a fifth of its value in real terms during 2008
8553381 the uk housing market downturn seems to be gathering pace which delivers a further blow to consumer spending as the wealth accumulation from the housing market dries up
8553382 we expect the next move in the bank rate to be down but the extent to which this will revive the mortgage and housing market is likely to be limited while overall confidence in economic and housing market conditions is low
8553383 geholfen haben au erdem die arbeitsmarktreformen sowie ein r ckl ufiges arbeitskr fteangebot das nach einsch tzung des instituts f r arbeitsmarkt und berufsforschung 2008 jahresdurchschnittlich um 94 000 abnehmen wird
8553384 ich habe im moment noch keine hinweise dass die arbeitsmarktentwicklung nach unten geht

8553386 das durchschnittliche einkommen vor steuern lag aufgrund der verbreiterung der datenbasis mit 30 100 euro um 10 3 niedriger als 2001 ja da verbreitern sich nicht nur die stirnadern und der blutdruck es ist nur dumm wenn praktisch gleichzeitig andere wahre daten auftauchen

8553392 i am sure that the united position of the sco member states will have international resonance
8553393 and i hope it will serve as a serious signal to those who try to turn black into white and justify this aggression
8553394 its well known who helped georgian authorities and even encouraged them in pursuit of their own aims this is unacceptable and must end
8553395 my hearing loss is an enormous challenge in both my personal and professional lives i have hope that there will be new restorative therapies for hearing loss in my lifetime
8553396 there is intense interest in cell replacement strategies to ameliorate the effects of inner ear disease but until now we didnt have direct evidence indicating we could make a functional sensory hair cell
8553397 we have the first step down we can induce functional sensory hair cells to form now we need to learn if its possible to restore hearing in a deaf mouse mutant experiments that are ongoing we know its possible to generate sensory hair cells that function and thats an important step toward defining rational therapies in humans i am profoundly hard of hearing the exciting news for those of us with hearing loss and tinnitus is that we now have hope of having our hearing restored some day

8553401 it was a very tough game and you have to give them credit
8553402 they have made it difficult for us over two legs but we have managed to scrape through
8553403 when times are hard it is about sticking together showing character and trying to grind wins out
8553404 we didnt give our best performance but kept working really hard until the end and i am really happy
8553405 what can i do about it apart from win games and keep going
8553406 ive had this now for a little while ill get on with it im a big boy as ive said before
8553407 the disappointing thing is the players are the ones that have to go out and perform the fans are brilliant when they are behind us and they have to realise the effect it has when they are not behind us it can all change at the weekend
8553408 football is a bit like this you go through periods like this it has happened to other managers and happened a bit last year
8553409 we have to win some games and play better football
8553410 i understand the responsibility of being west ham manager ive watched games at upton park and other managers here have had similar criticism
8553411 you have to get on with it its part and parcel that fans let you know when they are not happy its part and parcel of being part of this club and im not going to duck away from it
8553412 selbst nach der einseitigen erkl rung der unabh ngigkeit des kosovo
8553413 es gab keine institutionalisierte feststellung dauerhafter massiver menschenrechtsverletzungen die mit einer intervention h tten unterbunden werden m ssen und die unabh ngigkeit wurde erkl rt w hrend ein befreundeter staat seine truppen im land hat
8553414 die anerkennung eines gebildes ist nur dann keine verletzung des interventionsverbots wenn das selbstbestimmungsrecht zum recht auf sezession erstarkt wenn also durchgehende diskriminierung und brutale repression gegeben sind
8553415 its a long hard competition but they have the quality for it
8553416 this was a big game for us and i thought we were well organised disciplined and focused and never really under threat
8553417 the team was sharper and physically better than on saturday i couldnt have asked for a better response we want to play with the best and to do that we have to be among the best in the champions league
8553418 someone said before the match that the defeat at fulham made this the best time to play arsenal in fact it was the worst time
8553419 but ive always said that you have to be patient with him he has improved his first touch and his link up play he has worked a lot on these things to find the right balance between individual and team play
8553420 but the way he took his goal that is something you cannot teach it comes naturally

8553430 snatching up new zealand property as the dollar drops banks lower interest rates and the market reaches realistic prices
8553431 we believe land should be owned by new zealand citizens and residents only and our laws should be changed to say that
8553432 we welcome ex pats coming home and people coming to this country to live but why should we allow singaporean australian or american speculators to buy investment properties in our country shutting first time home buyers from the market
8553433 the government has a responsibility first and foremost to ensure new zealand citizens and residents can afford to buy a stake in their own country if people from overseas wish to become new zealand citizens or permanent residents then they are very welcome to buy land here by restricting ownership to new zealand residents and citizens that would greatly help stabilise the property market and make ownership more attainable for those who live here
8553434 i dont feel this would have any affect at all
8553435 foreign investors arent to blame for the price of new zealand property at all the normal fundamental reason of supply and demand is why first home buyers are having issues securing their first home its a problem most countries around the world have and have always had its never been easy to buy your first home and new zealand had similar problems back in the 80s and 90s its all relative
8553436 the uk has traditionally shown strong interest in new zealand and will continue to do so
8553437 the purchasing power for an investor in the uk is strong and will only get better the nzd is weakening nz interest rates are dropping house prices have come and rents have increased compared to last year new zealand property is a whole lot more attractive although the uk buyer is tailing off somewhat asian american and south african investors are showing strong interest at present
8553438 we are delighted that sarah will be joining altair her working experience in the payments industry especially the prepaid market will be of great benefit throughout altair sarahs focus with altair will be to ensure delivery of leading edge payment systems geared towards business solutions working with local regulators payment services providers banks and card schemes
8553439 her experience coupled with her passion and broad perspective of the payments industry puts sarah in a position to strengthen altairs overall proposition to clients suppliers and cardholders
8553440 this is a very exciting career move for me and im thrilled to work within such a dynamic and innovative company in the prepaid and processing space
8553441 taking into consideration that armenian card is a multi bank processing centre while selecting the processing solution we paid special attention to the opportunity of remote management of both the whole self service network and separate devices

8553443 even if i am a minority of one truth is still the truth
8553444 the smallest minority on earth is the individual those who deny individual rights cannot claim to be defenders of minorities
8553445 there are four characteristics which brand a country unmistakably as a dictatorship one party rule executions without trial or with a mock trial for political offenses the nationalization or expropriation of private property and censorship a country guilty of these outrages forfeits any moral prerogatives any claim to national rights or sovereignty and becomes an outlaw
8553446 the uk has a comprehensive network of bilateral double taxation conventions and we are committed to maintaining and strengthening this network
8553447 these agreements help uk business and investors to remain competitive by providing them with a measure of certainty and stability in their tax affairs
8553448 in view of this scenario if you take the price movement of ongc it is giving a very good trading band of about rs 80 100 it has been hovering between a price of rs 1 100 it goes up to that level again corrects back to rs 1 000 may be last week or ten days back it was ruling at about rs 1 100 and at that time the call was given to book profit so probably this is a classic case of entry and exit into the stock on an investment based buying and selling so probably at current level of rs 1 000 makes a good buy at these levels which one could think of moving out at rs 1 100 instead of taking a long term or may be a medium term fundamental call so probably this is the time i recommend to buy at around rs 1 000 for the stock
8553449 we think it speaks to them using a character they can relate to
8553450 frankly the corvette doesnt do much for chevrolet the car
8553451 we have done this before but it was more promotional our goal is to create a
8553452 now with the changed scenario where the interest rate sensitive sectors are taking a beating whether it is realty or maybe the banking stocks or maybe the automobiles and all that probably the view is cautious on the stock at these levels if someone is holding the stock probably can remain invested but fresh buying definitely should not be made at least at a level of about rs 470 475 so if corrects to about rs 425 440 probably one could give a thought at those levels to make an entry into the stock

8553459 too much looking back is a weariness to the soul
8553460 self is an illusion generated by the chemical activity of the brain that there is no such thing as mind that there is only matter
8553461 its important to note that this is a business decision to initiate a strategic review to explore options
8553462 weve been approached by third parties and weve agreed to listen there can be no assurance that any transaction will take place as a result of this process
8553463 there was huge mania around the vehicle when it was first shown at the detroit show and it was green lighted but it has probably never sold more than a couple of thousand units in its peak years
8553464 even though they found a way to make it a business case to build it by using components and sharing as much as they could it still was expensive to build
8553465 there is no doubt in general about the trickle down effect of having a flagship vehicle it enhances the emotion of a brand and it is the epitome of what the brand stands for

8553471 der visuelle aspekt spielt in der heutigen zeit eine gro e rolle daher ist es wichtig dass auch der paralympische sport und sein umfeld mit einem kompetenten partner in diesem bereich zusammenarbeiten die picture alliance bietet nicht nur einen umfassenden und hochprofessionellen service sondern bringt sich auch mit gro en engagement in die kooperation ein das ist eine sehr gute basis f r eine erfolgreiche zusammenarbeit

8553474 andernfalls kann eine haftung f r steuernachzahlungen nicht ausgeschlossen werden
8553475 arbeitgeber die die einf hrung von zeitwertkonten planen sollten sich f r ein modell der externen kapitalanlage entscheiden welches nicht die gefahr des totalverlust des wertguthabens birgt
8553476 in frage kommen hier gestaltungen bei welchen dem arbeitnehmer zumindest der erhalt der eingebrachten gehaltsbestandteile oder eine mindestverzinsung des wertguthabens zugesagt wird solche modelle sind im brigen auch arbeitsrechtlich weit weniger bedenklich

8553580 now that we have promised to deliver a substantial donation to the project pending the success of the 2008 burton beer festival it is hoped big brewers and pub companies will see the logic in joining in and supporting the establishment of a national brewing museum
8553581 renowned brewing nations such as belgium poland and denmark all have brewing museums the czech republic even has two therefore how can we sit alongside these revered nations without a monument of our own
8553582 there have been many brewers rumoured to be considering support for the plans and i think it must be stressed that this museum will celebrate the history of british brewing as a whole and not just bass and coors as some have suggested
8553583 i dont love you like that anymore i thought this three months ago but i thought having you come out here face to face would spark it again it didnt i am a horrible person for doing this to you i promise to pay you back all the money you spent and i hope we can be friends

8553591 we havent had a real energy policy in this country in 30 years
8553592 the last time a president came to office facing problems as big as ours was franklin delano roosevelt
8553593 the major differences between now and then though is that now the federal government is bankrupt the next president will have no money to borrow to retrofit our homes for energy efficiency we have no money to borrow to invest in alternative energy if we can retain a portion of that 700 million we export every year theres our money

8553612 ive just agreed to write a movie for sony and producer scott rudin about how facebook was invented
8553613 i figured a good first step in my preparation would be finding out what facebook is so ive started this page
8553614 i understand there are a few other people using facebook pages under my name which i find more flattering than creepy but this is me i dont know how i can prove that but feel free to test me
8553615 i figured a good first step in my preparation would be finding out what facebook is so ive started this page
8553616 i honestly dont know how im going to write the movie yet
8553617 i feel about this introduction the way i felt about sophies choice it could have been funnier
8553618 the new series of torchwood is hugely bold and promises to be bigger and better than ever the audience is in for an amazing ride
8553619 this series is one big serial and the most ambitious story weve ever made and weve got plenty of surprises in store
8553620 it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as it is great and fantastic
8553621 im not against it so long as it never gets in the way of the tv show if it got in the way of the show that would be appalling
8553622 i felt good thats the best ive felt in four five months
8553623 each time they call me the pharmacy calls me or the police department calls me i always tell them one thing pursue the patient and arrest them
8553624 michigan has been hit harder than any other state by president bush and tim walbergs failed economic policies so i hope sen obama will focus on his plan for assisting the domestic auto industry and moving america toward a renewable energy economy
8553625 we have an opportunity to be a leader in this exciting new industry and create thousands of green collar jobs and as a member of congress ill fight to make sure michigan gets the attention it deserves from our next president
8553626 its probably the best moment in my career weve played them for years and i dont think weve ever won
8553627 were still putting our team together with school not started theres been one practice where weve had almost everyone there
8553628 stephan sherman played phenomenal in the back and kept things organized
8553629 hes played sweeper for two years and hes a big part of the defense
8553630 we came out real flat we didnt play real sharp and i was complaining to the guys all game
8553631 im not that happy we play lakeview next week in a league game and im not real happy with how were looking going into that game to tell you the truth
8553632 im kind of shocked central lost to albion and we dominated albion so im not too sure what to make of that
8553633 but my team has had a habit of playing down to teams so my worry is central could pull an upset on us if central is on a run here and we play like we did tonight they might have two upsets this tournament
8553634 this is my first year of varsity and my first goals this year
8553635 it was real good especially with it being the first one we had and it pushed us ahead
8553636 so it was really neat to see him get that goal
8553637 its kind of tough today was extra tough because we were missing a couple players so that kind of hurt us
8553638 and the freshmen got a lot of playing time so its kind of hard for them to hang with a good team like harper creek
8553639 i like the way he handles a broad range of subjects in an engaging and friendly manner definitely one of the good guys
8553640 right wing blogging from a uk student a fresh perspective on a plethora of events with a healthy interest in shelf stacking to boot
8553641 one of the more depressing aspects of blogging and the modern world is seeing reams of text on a page the thunder dragons mixture of politics and fun posts with good illustrations and quickly made points makes his blog an accessible and fun place to discuss and think about politics the thunderdragon is one of the rising stars of conservative blogging
8553642 already an a lister technical whiz thunder dragon shows that not all a listers are stuck up stats groupies whod sell their grandmothers for more traffic and hes on iain dales list for a reason hes simply a fine blogger scoring highly on the ten point dale criteria and with his finger always on the political pulse hes also the technical brains behind blogpower along with ian at imagined community
8553643 the thunderdragon consistently provides an interesting and enjoyable read always entertaining and often insightful his writing may even give us a foretaste of our political future stick with him after all time will cure his youth
8553644 i have a sword but i have chosen not to use it
8553645 we are staging a protest because the government has made too many mistakes and has no legitimacy to run the country
8553646 en elke dag liepen we op klompjes naar de school met de bijbel
8553647 in oostburg merkten we er weinig van wel heeft mijn vader zandzakken gesjouwd bij breskens ik weet nog dat het verschrikkelijk stormde
8553648 ik wilde kraamverzorgster worden en volgde een opleiding bij het groene kruis in doorn
8553649 daar heb ik het nooit naar mijn zin gehad ik fietste veel naar het strand ik verlangde naar zeeland
8553650 hij was heel open over wat hij had meegemaakt en sprak er veel over
8553651 ik voel me niet echt bij nederland horen je kunt naar de rest van het land alleen via de westerscheldetunnel en daar moet je ook nog eens tol voor betalen belachelijk amsterdammers zouden dit echt niet nemen
8553652 ik luister via de radio naar veel verschillende kerkdiensten ik ben nooit van het geloof afgestapt
8553653 i have done what i thought was right to protect the safety of the public on our highways
8553654 it will be the members of the general assembly who will have on their hands the consequences of this law i hope and pray no one gets hurt
8553655 we can get no documentation that says anything that has occurred in the past has proven to us that it is dangerous
8553656 these guys are supposed to be on the same side and on a relatively non controversial piece of legislation easley becomes the first governor to have a veto overridden in north carolina history
8553657 were making an exclusion for a small group of people
8553658 when the u s department of defense wants to transport equipment over 8 feet wide they have to apply for a permit when the forest service wants to move bulldozers and equipment to work in areas throughout the state they have to apply for permits just like any agency or any business
8553659 i felt like today the governor saw a mistake that we made by voting for this
8553660 a lot of people try to bring boats that have no business being trailered down these narrow highways to the outer banks
8553661 ive been doing this for 30 years and never had an accident
8553662 one reason we dont have accidents is that when youre towing something like that you know youve got something big behind you and youre more careful going down the road
8553663 this was an odd piece of legislation for the governor to stand on but after the past eight years im not surprised
8553664 this is the most expensive governor initiated session of his term
8553665 we have bridges in north carolina where two cars cant cross at the same time
8553666 ik deed de havo op de jacobus fruytier scholengemeenschap in apeldoorn
8553667 lerares basisonderwijs pabo aan hogeschool driestar educatief in gouda volgende week start ik met het derde leerjaar de opleiding is tot nu toe echt leuk na de pabo wil ik nog wel iets anders studeren ik ben dan pas 20 jaar oud en dat lijkt me geen goede leeftijd om al voor de klas te gaan staan dus wil ik nog de parttimeopleiding voor docent in het voortgezet onderwijs gaan doen
8553668 docent geschiedenis lijkt me wel wat over hoe je kunt leren van het verleden en bomen met leerlingen over actuele ontwikkelingen
8553669 ik woon op het pabo internaat in gouda lekker dicht bij school de weekends ben ik thuis dus ik reis twee keer per week met de trein tussen gouda en apeldoorn op het internaat is het echt gezellig de kamer deel ik met mijn vriendin van de middelbare school en verder zitten er op onze etage in totaal vijftien meiden het internaat kost ongeveer 185 euro per maand niet duur want daarvoor krijg je ook een avondmaaltijd die wordt door het ziekenhuis hiernaast gekookt echt goed eten
8553670 af en toe bezoek ik de pabostudentenvereniging moza ek maar ik ben er geen lid van ook shop ik wel eens bij studentenverenigingen in de buurt maar daar wil ik het bij houden anders voel ik me verplicht om te komen en daar heb ik geen behoefte aan de verdieping krijg ik door op donderdagavond is0 de cursus cgo b te volgen in het driestargebouw hiernaast en wat gezelligheid betreft heb je aan het internaat genoeg
8553671 ik heb het geluk dat mijn ouders zowel mijn studiekosten als het internaat betalen de studiekosten zijn rond de 1800 euro geloof ik zelf betaal ik mijn boeken en kleding die boeken kosten ongeveer 400 euro per jaar als je alles nieuw koopt tenminste en dan komen daar nog de moduleboeken en naslagboeken bij al met al heb ik het makkelijk omdat mijn ouders zo veel betalen daarnaast heb ik een zaterdagbaantje bij een slager in beekbergen volgens mij kun je je studietijd net zo duur maken als je zelf wilt maar een lening heb ik gelukkig niet nodig
8553672 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8553673 is there an army cover up of the rape and murder of women soldiers
8553674 is there an army cover up of rape and murder of women soldiers
8553675 lavena was clearly happy and seemed in very good health both physically and emotionally
8553676 two ex kbr employees say they were raped by co workers in iraq
8553677 enforcement of federal criminal law to protect americans working for u s contractors in iraq
8553678 closing legal loopholes prosecuting sexual assaults and other violent crimes committed overseas by american civilians in a combat environment
8553679 the 19 year old female lavena johnson died as a result of a gunshot wound of the head that caused injuries to the skull and brain the entrance wound was inside the mouth and injuries to the lips and oral mucosa were a direct result of the discharge of the weapon the exit wound was located on the left side of the head no bullet or bullet fragments were recovered toxicology was negative for alcohol and other screened drugs the investigative information made available indicates that this was a self inflicted gunshot wound with the information surrounding the circumstances of the death that is presently available the manner of death is determined to be suicide
8553680 investigative information made available indicat ing that this was a self inflicted gunshot wound
8553681 the witness name redacted found the victim under the bench and verified there were no signs of life related he saw the m16 lying across the victims body he didnt know what setting the weapon was on he related everything was smoking including parts of the body he called for an ambulance and secured the scene

8553686 there is no excuse for the u s armys shabby treatment of kamisha blocks parents and others who cared for her her commanders knew right away that she had been killed by a fellow soldier in iraq who had been harassing her it was a standard murder suicide incredibly the army first told her parents that it was an accidental death due to friendly fire

8553695 los neoyorquinos est n contagi ndose con vih a un ritmo tres veces superior al nacional
8553696 hace falta que halla mas difusi n entre la poblaci n en general para que no les de miedo hacerse el examen creo que algunos tienen unos antecedentes de regiones riesgosas pero no consideran que sean positivos
8553697 entre las personas que se dedican a la comercializaci n del sexo son personas que tienen la cultura de estarse checando frecuentemente
8553698 la semana contra el sida deber de hacer antes de diciembre es algo que nos marco censida en la pasada reuni n
8553699 hay que detectarlos oportunamente porque entre m s temprano se detecten mayor oportunidad tiene de salir adelante
8553700 por existir migraci n y por esa transmisi n que existe se hace bien importante el que podamos difundir que si hay sida
8553701 lo que queremos es detectarlos y meterlos a ese control y cortar la transmisi n para poder estar en un futuro de disminuci n
8553702 el taller comprende hablar sobre derechos sexuales la ley nacional de salud sexual la ley provincial de salud sexual y sobre m todos de anticoncepci n especialmente se alarle a los chicos cuales son los m todos anticonceptivos considerados dentro del programa nacional y de distribuci n gratuita
8553703 porque se trata de salud sexual y todo lo que sea salud perinatal
8553704 la muestra est dividida en varios paneles y lo nuestro ten a que ver con los derechos sobre sexualidad una sexualidad equitativa placentera y elegida formamos a los gu as a nosotras nos correspondieron 6 paneles
8553705 algunas veces hacemos cambio en la din mica o en el lenguaje que utilizamos con los j venes pasa que tenemos que hacer algunos arreglos y lo adaptamos seg n el grupo de personas a los que nos dirigimos en ese momento
8553706 tenemos preparada una din mica de taller o una exposici n durante la ma ana asistieron alrededor de 150 chicos de escuelas para los que hicimos dos presentaciones en power point y una demostraci n del uso correcto del preservativo que fue con una din mica de taller
8553707 un poco de informaci n las v as de transmisi n medidas de prevenci n en esta oportunidad especialmente preparamos algo de legislaci n porque justamente hablamos de derechos derechos de las personas en general los derechos de salud sexual y reproductiva y derechos de aquellas personas que viven con vih
8553708 queremos cortar los contagios y disminuir a la mitad los enfermos y la mortalidad para el a o 2015 de acuerdo con los objetivos del milenio planteados por naciones unidas
8553709 como los enfermos comienzan a sentirse bien con el tratamiento suelen dejar de tomar los medicamentos y as se ponen en riesgo a s mismos y a los dem s ya que pueden agravarse y morir adem s de seguir contagiando a trav s de sus expectoraciones
8553710 pueda tener alguna influencia en el despliegue de la ley
8553711 que acompa a la ley en el momento de su aprobaci n en el parlamento
8553712 a cualquiera le puede pasar el virus del vih no distingue g neros clases sociales no tiene frontera ni color
8553713 somos muy pocas porque adem s existe miedo de parte de las dem s a ser reconocidas la mayor a no quiere ser visible porque el problema es que detr s de cada mujer hay una familia donde tambi n ah existe el fantasma de la exclusi n
8553714 el acompa amiento y el apoyo psicosocial es sumamente fundamental ya sea desde el primer momento del diagn stico hasta lo que se llama la adherencia al tratamiento porque es ah donde surgen los inconvenientes porque el virus hace resistencia a la medicaci n por lo que hay bajones y ca das a lo largo del tratamiento
8553715 es lamentable pero una vez que se conoce que se tiene el virus la propia familia discrimina por el desconocimiento que se tiene
8553716 el vih sida adem s de ser un problema de salud es un problema social
8553717 no se cuentan con los recursos necesarios para hacer frente a la problem tica porque uno de los grandes desaf os es lograr que la poblaci n pobre deje de ser la m s vulnerable
8553718 aquellos que abogan por el vih y la salud global tienen suficientes enemigos comunes el m s importante de ellos es la complacencia pol tica y los recursos humanos y financieros inadecuados
8553719 en la lucha por el reconocimiento del cuidado de la salud como un derecho humano somos socios naturales
8553720 si la urgencia del sida y la gran magnitud de las p rdidas humanas que experimentamos en la actualidad no es suficiente para obligarnos a suministrar aunque sea el nivel m s b sico de cuidado de la salud a aquellos que viven en pa ses de bajo ingreso entonces nosotros como comunidad global estamos moralmente quebrados
8553721 yo no vivo con el virus el virus vive conmigo
8553722 mi problema no es el virus mi gran problema es la situaci n socioecon mica que padezco
8553723 el rol de los medios respecto de la promoci n y reducci n del consumo de tabaco
8553724 if somebody doesnt go to the final four during their four years at duke then thats too darn bad
8553725 what we didnt go to the final four we didnt win the national championship theyre very spoiled
8553726 it ruins it a little bit really a lot because of that sometimes when you win youre just relieved im not saying that that happens all the time but it happens
8553727 at the end of that spain game when most people would say werent you relieved no i wasnt i was exhilarated i was euphoric it was the way it should be and thats the way its going to be for me for the rest of my career at duke
8553728 theres no way i shouldnt have done this for duke for me for our country for the kids i coach
8553729 im a better coach to them and a better person as a result we didnt go to the ncaa final four during the last two years because we had two young teams and we got beat all of a sudden theres a reason
8553730 so were not reliant totally on our own marketing resources to do that
8553731 over time the subscriber growth will be much more a function of cable and international distribution deals
8553732 well be focusing on heart opening postures heart healing and restoring our holistic balance
8553733 the higher oil price doesnt help the transport sector either
8553734 harvey norman will give indications of how consumers are faring
8553735 these poll findings show just how many people are getting worried about losing their job in the current economic slowdown of course this does not mean that
8553736 these findings add to the growing pressure on the government and economic policy makers to put growth first by doing all they can to restore confidence and boost investment
8553737 its not flat its bumpy a centimetre high in some places and three inches in others
8553738 there were a lot of concerns about how fast the economy was slowing with this strong capital expenditure theres a possibility that the gdp for the second quarter will be better than expected
8553739 the rba may not be as aggressive in its rate cuts
8553740 while we are capable of meeting current demand there is a backlog of high priority patients
8553741 in that context the decision to outsource to an australian hospital with the capacity to perform that surgery within the next three months makes sense
8553742 while we are capable of meeting current demand there is a backlog of high priority patients
8553743 transparency trust and control with respect to the sites they visit
8553744 if ie8 helps heighten awareness of this value exchange thats a step in the right direction
8553745 today as a user we have no visibility or control over how that information is shared and recorded
8553746 i wouldnt put microsoft as being the arbiter of what should and shouldnt be tracked
8553747 i think microsoft realizes we all realize that its a beta version and its sure to change before its finalized
8553748 you just have to decide if youre a tigger or an eeyore i think im clear where i stand on the great tigger eeyore debate never lose the childlike wonder its just too important its what drives us
8553749 i think in these matters its best to proceed with all due care and deliberation and of course people are always innocent until proven guilty
8553750 on information currently to hand there are serious questions whether donations intended for one purpose may have been put to a different purpose
8553751 if they had the courtesy to talk to me this matter would have been cleared up in a few minutes
8553752 killings and torture committed by military security forces protecting and paid for by emoi
8553753 sufficient evidence at this stage for their allegations of serious abuse
8553754 until now i had no idea about that if its true ive just learnt about it from you
8553755 just go ahead and sue the one who will be sued is exxon right

8553767 over the years the united states has sent many of its fine young men and women into great peril to fight for freedom beyond our borders the only amount of land we have ever asked for in return is enough to bury those that did not return

8553778 quite frankly young marines join our corps to go fight for their country
8553779 they are doing a very good job of this nation building business in iraq but its our view that if there is a stiffer fight going someplace else then thats where we need to be
8553780 declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8553781 not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8553782 the sight of russian tanks in a neighboring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain
8553783 it has showed up a little bit more especially in the past year
8553784 our studies show that with only three out of every 10 people of military age being capable of joining the army we are going to have to do something different
8553785 its a tough structured day some of them have sat on the couch for 18 years but i havent heard any howling yet

8553815 baracks candidacy would not have been conceivable 50 years ago
8553816 kings speech brought about a significant outpouring of support among whites for the idea of civil rights reform and even though obama wants to run as a trans racial candidate his candidacy obviously has enormous symbolic significance
8553817 he has to present himself as the american candidate for president not the african american candidate
8553818 anybody who gives a speech on this kind of occasion speaks in kings shadow and is judged in comparison with him
8553819 thats part of the enormous challenge obama has created for himself for better or worse by happenstance or design he has set the rhetorical bar extraordinarily high
8553820 that speech was the first time many in our generation heard him speak in a coherent consistent way instead of the sound bites that wed been exposed to on the news
8553821 obama is probably the best political speaker weve had since ronald reagan
8553822 hes a highly rational speaker unlike king but at the same time touches people emotionally what gives him his emotional power is his use of the language of transformation obama is able to rise above the particulars of the moment and talk more in universals that can encompass people of many ideologies
8553823 in a sense he needs to do something similar to what king did
8553824 to do what only great orators can do offer a compelling vision of the future thats what great oratory is its not just putting words together its putting the right words to match the historical moment
8553825 its going to be an uncomfortable day so take precautions drink plenty of water and stay out of the heat as much as possible
8553826 extra precautions such as staying out of the heat and drinking lots of water are basic tips that could potentially save a life
8553827 would you want somebody peeking through your window at you
8553828 its a good thing for insurance companies because it reduces their risk but the main benefit is for consumers and the environment
8553829 this is something many consumers will benefit from for example people in the bay area where you have transit choices can take public transit once in a while instead of driving why not create an incentive
8553830 its wildly popular and drivers are saving a lot of money
8553831 when readers see a rare 10 million bike pedestrian bridge over i 280 at mary avenue they may not recall the long list of expensive car only highway projects such as 125 million for 101 85 in mountain view 81 million for 880 coleman avenue 76 million to widen i 880 at brokaw road 68 million for 101 85 in south san jose 54 million for widening 101 from morgan hill to san jose 50 million for 237 880 and 43 million to widen highway 87
8553832 to affirm that there is an absolute constitutional protection of life in gestation would lead to the violation of the fundamental rights of women
8553833 i think the conventions gone pretty well so far dont you think
8553834 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8553835 i am here for everyone i grew up with in scranton and wilmington
8553836 i am here for the cops and firefighters the teachers and assembly line workers the folks whose lives are the very measure of whether the american dream endures
8553837 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8553838 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8553839 actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8553840 lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8553841 minha perda de audi o um grande desafio tanto para minha vida pessoal como para a profissional
8553842 tenho esperan a que haver terapias de restaura o para perda de audi o ainda durante a minha vida

8553844 a citizen sees the beating in a parking lot police get there fast they see him beating her its a good solid case
8553845 he was on top of her actually in the act of violently beating her when the officers arrived with the knife in his hand
8553846 the victim purposely grabbed the steering wheel and caused the vehicle to hit the curb
8553847 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8553848 ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8553849 the campaign generated so much heat it increased global warming
8553850 in the end my candidate didnt win but im very proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8553851 his life is a 21st century incarnation of the american dream
8553852 his achievements are proof of our continuing progress toward the more perfect union of our founders dreams
8553853 we see that humanity that strength and our future in barack and michelle obama and their beautiful children
8553854 she didnt want to be seen as bills third term
8553855 he was in a rage over how they used him
8553856 he was not used to the 24 7 news cycle and people with cell phones recording what he said at every stop
8553857 but you cant blame bill clinton for the loss at end of the day he was a huge plus
8553858 there is combat every day in this province and that isnt going to end any time soon
8553859 we are going to stay in the fight and we have to stay active in order to prevail and not lose the initiative to the insurgents
8553860 do we have enough soldiers and policemen to control this province at this time the answer is no
8553861 this blatant disregard for human life is simply not acceptable
8553862 i am happy to report we that we have had very few civilian casualties as a result of our operations in kandahar province this year
8553863 we deeply regret any accidental loss of life that occurs as a result of our actions
8553864 he was cut on the back of his head blood was coming out the side of his mouth and his lip was cut
8553865 o j hit the cupboard hard and the glass shattered all over him he fell to the floor bleeding
8553866 this speech is different i think theyre much more interested in what am i going to do to help them in their lives and so in that sense i think this is going to be a more workmanlike speech im not aiming for a lot of high rhetoric
8553867 hes going to lay out the case for change hes going to set the stakes of this election the risks of continuing down the road were on which is plainly what senator mccain is offering
8553868 obama keeps talking about change but any change is a gamble
8553869 it means stepping into the unknown and if the argument is being made by somebody whos not that well known theres even more apprehension about the unknown
8553870 the american people want a democratic president theyre just not sure they want this democrat
8553871 three quarters of the electorate is still going to be white
8553872 hes doing pretty well among them but that only puts him neck and neck with mccain he needs to do better
8553873 muito perigoso h outros objetivos que se pode supor sejam os da r ssia em particular a crim ia a ucr nia e mold via
8553874 enquanto a r ssia enviou ajuda para regi es ucranianas afetadas por enchentes a ucr nia falhou em ajudar a r ssia a for ar a paz na ge rgia e adotou uma postura abertamente hostil
8553875 a coaliz o mais ampla poss vel contra a agress o russa na ge rgia
8553876 o presidente russo diz que n o tem medo de uma nova guerra fria n s n o queremos uma ele tem uma grande responsabilidade de n o iniciar uma
8553877 moscou agiu brutalmente na ge rgia mas quando os estados unidos e a gr bretanha apoiaram a independ ncia do kosovo sem a aprova o das na es unidas eles abriram caminho para a defesa russa da oss tia do sul e para a atual humilha o do ocidente

8553895 the film people dramatically underestimated games complexity they made no intelligent connection that would result in something the audience would enjoy good business stories perhaps but bad production models
8553896 the industry is much more like the rest of entertainment dominated by less than a handful while everyone else scrounges for pennies
8553897 what came first was a story we havent told yet it was about a guy who lost his body to a credit card racket i told it to sherry in 1992 in the context of a larger epic and it was basically oddworld
8553898 doing 3d with clothes was a royal pain in the ass so i focused on the guy with the loincloth instead and where does he work the meat processing plant of course its silly how the most practical necessities can drive your biggest ideas
8553899 thered be some areas that were as primitive as possible others as high tech as tokyo new york or london so wed have the full gauntlet what i wanted to do with the oddworld quintology an ambition that on and off he still pursues was start in the third world then you find yourself dead smack in the centre of trade and commerce gnarlybebb that would be our manhattan

8553951 the plan is to consult with court managers to determine in each court what is the best way we can achieve the savings we need while having the least impact on public access to the courts
8553952 the kinds of questions were asking are should all the courts be closed the same half day each week does it make sense to have some courts closed at different times were pretty much into that kind of micro planning at the moment
8553953 its definitely not going to be to anybodys advantage to close it everything will just get backed up i dont think its such a good idea
8553954 its incredibly smart very very very vivid completely ungratuitous for a shows that as hardcore and violent and explosive and radical behavior these are not your average conservative republicans these guys are ruthless and badass
8553955 the way its depicted is very organic which you could only do if youre a brilliant screenwriter as kurt sutter is and as an actor you know youre always going to be supported never going to be made to look gratuitous or silly because everything is incredibly well supported in a very organic and very brilliant way
8553956 i feel like a full patch member of sons of anarchy being neck deep in this project for a year and a half now so im thrilled to get the opportunity to not only explore the outlaw motorcycle world but to do it with grit and authenticity
8553957 our goal was to create a new and distinctive series for jesse that is unlike anything else on television
8553958 in this series viewers will get to experience one of the most fearless guys on the planet in an entirely new way taking on death defying physical challenges each week
8553959 first my heart is sad i feel like the guns were held to the heads of the clintons and they had no choice but to support barack he stole hillarys wiser more reasoned positions later after he got the nomination i do not trust him
8553960 third i cant do it i was just in it for hillary and for me and i refuse to vote for a punk who stole her positions and stole this election i live in kansas and so it really does not matter but i dont trust him i cant trust
8553961 i did love hillarys humor the sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits brilliant
8553962 oh my mom would have loved that too she and i cried for four days in our living room in iowa with the drapes drawn after we watched
8553963 i wanted hillary to talk about the personal side that it was hard for her to lose and now she has moved on and we need to also but she didnt dare do it she leapt over that moment it is like skipping a vital stage of the five stages of grief
8553964 so i cannot vote for him i am not over it unfinished business i feel lied to by obama i would vote for
8553965 america is in deep trouble hillary clinton had no real choice but to put on her brave face and her orange ukrainian revolution pantsuit but she did not even dare to talk about her pain for fear of two things crying herself and fomenting a revolt on the floor of the convention
8553966 thats how fragile obamas tie vs mccain is in the polls she could not even claim and own her personal moment for fear it would flip the momentum to her and away from this faltering weak puppet man
8553967 hillary i was in it for you i was in it for us i was in it for the possibility of women as leaders you were a superior candidate to either obama or mccain i gave you money when i was living off of my savings as a tribute to 26 or more years as a feminist
8553968 america has sold out and abandoned my issues our leaders are the hollow men they are puppets put up by men behind the scenes women have abandoned other women including
8553969 i dont see much of a future god help us
8553970 wenn die vp f r die zukunft der hacklerregelung mehr regeln will dann werde ich mir das anschauen
8553971 warum war es notwendig die vereinbarung aufzuk ndigen das war aus meiner sicht nicht notwendig
8553972 wir wollen beides die f nf punkte und eine steuerentlastung
8553973 wir haben schon dar ber geredet aber ich habe keine chance gesehen
8553974 ok you all delay to discuss the further actions so its the monsters turn again
8553975 using the leverage from his superior size orgok the mighty swings his gigantic axe d20 point at brute strike and connects squarely with the head of his opponent he suffers greatly 4w i believe taking 22 damage
8553976 this is a great place to work compassionate effective management and family style teamwork
8553977 het bestemmingsplan biedt de mogelijkheid om er een moerasgebied van te maken
8553978 op het moment dat we het stuk tussen de hollandsche ijssel en a20 inrichten zullen we daar zeker rekening mee houden nieuwerkerk wil het laagste punt niet verliezen en het blijft ook hier
8553979 this is a great place to work compassionate effective management and family style teamwork
8553980 i think theres a lot of talent out there that hasnt taken the field for an a league team yet
8553981 the premier leagues in each of the states have a lot of players who are capable of playing at the a league level but because of the small number of teams probably havent got their opportunity yet
8553982 we think theres a very strong interest in football but more importantly theres a strong interest in following sport
8553983 obviously thats going to be up to miron to pull a rabbit out of the hat
8553984 at the end of the day you are in here to win
8553985 we are here not only to win but to create a special environment for the people who are on the coast and in northern new south wales
8553986 if youre going to talk the talk youve got to walk the walk
8553987 theres nothing about the tests that is designed to create anxiety or create a sense of evaluation or create a sense of being compared to someone else
8553988 once the information is available the potential exists for school administrators to use it to track students and make premature assessments
8553989 were teaching kids how to get the right answers not how to find the knowledge

8554006 this is a place where young people come to grow as individuals and find that thing that makes them special
8554007 the stories the kids who come here tell us will break your heart but what they learn here and how they grow is pretty special
8554008 we didnt want just a place where kids came to hang out
8554009 girls are pink and boys are blue and when they mix you get purple
8554010 mark saw the potential and worked to make something of it
8554011 i started with cooking classes because you know i like to eat then i did some welding and made jewelry to give to people and now im doing photography ive done sewing and a bunch of stuff
8554012 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8554013 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8554014 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8554015 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8554016 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8554017 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8554018 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8554019 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8554020 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8554021 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8554022 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8554023 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8554024 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8554025 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8554026 haramain milik semua umat islam letakkan haramain di bawah oic

8554029 i always instilled in my students that we work together
8554030 i will be a unifying personality who will help bring everybody together
8554031 i think one of the biggest mistakes weve ever made in our district was to close our technical high school
8554032 it does seem like its been a long time since may 25
8554033 its amazing the progress weve made but its going to take a while before everything gets back to normal
8554034 that probably wont happen until a year from now when our tax collection will be half of what it was
8554035 were more than satisfied with anything that keeps iowa first in the nation
8554036 i dont necessarily think its fair for students in their own school districts to have to be moved around for students coming from other schools
8554037 my husband and i opened the transfer letters looked and saw what it was about and put it in the shredder
8554038 these classes will be broken up after theyve already started and thats not good for the kids
8554039 you get them in and settle them then you disrupt it again and we have to explain to a child why hes no longer in his friends class
8554040 what about the fat kid who is crap at sports
8554041 i cant work because ive got condition x so im disabled and youre just unemployed
8554042 well my condition y trumps your x so i need
8554043 the court finds that the ordinance as written is too ambiguous to be enforceable
8554044 we feel this ordinance regulates quality of life issues which are of ultimate importance to residents in our unincorporated areas
8554045 our intent was not to put any catering trucks out of business but to ensure fairness to our residents those who live in homes right in front of or across the street from where trucks do business everyday all hours of the day or night
8554046 if you cant manage your restaurant business in a way so that you can compete with a taco truck maybe you should find another business
8554047 this law hurt us it favors some businesses over others and makes a hardworking person into a delinquent
8554048 we always knew when the whistle blew something bad happened
8554049 we need to complete this project so our past contributions to this community will not be forgotten
8554050 the worlds largest and most progressive grassroots network of breast cancer survivors and activists
8554051 i thought it was a great opportunity for her and i to bond and support a great cause at the same time
8554052 shes usually the one who keeps pushing me to do this stuff
8554053 i am extremely goal driven and i was going to do anything it took to raise the money but it came a little easier than i expected
8554054 if we dont have the police show up we werent successful
8554055 i do believe that by adjusting that date we got a much better response for the citizens the weather was perfect obviously we cant control the weather but its always nice when it cooperates
8554056 that will offset the traffic that would be put in there by the development
8554057 we all realize this is a very high traffic volume area with no easy solution the challenge is to provide a safe route with existing conditions and plan for future capacity and safety enhancements
8554058 since weve had an interim director we havent missed a beat
8554059 myojin of lifes web comes into play with a divinity counter on it if you played it from your hand
8554060 i dont want to tell them their business but it really ought to be a gold statue
8554061 she took your spot on letterman since you couldnt make it
8554062 i hope some of the neighbors dont mind if i walk in their backyards but thats the way im going to have to do it
8554063 tired of hearing the same convention speech over and over
8554064 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8554065 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8554066 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8554067 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8554068 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8554069 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8554070 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8554071 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8554072 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8554073 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8554074 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8554075 the issue for robot developers is whether the technology of artificial intelligence will allow japanese developers to fulfill their vision of friendly robots capable of working alongside people if so japan could be in a position to dominate the next phase of robotics if not the americans with their pragmatic but uninspiring designs could win the race
8554076 we can make more money in mobile than desktop eventually because the mobile computer is more targeted you carry your phone everywhere it knows all about you it knows what youre up to we can do a very very targeted ad over time well make more money from mobile advertising
8554077 it used its air zoom cushioning a staple in its sneakers in the sole to make the boot more comfortable the century old spur system was replaced with a titanium screw in model that was easier to install and adjust instead of a vertical zipper on the back of the boot nike designed one that wraps around the calf theres also grippy rubber on the part of the boot that touches the saddle to improve handling as well as red piping and a shiny heel for flourish
8554078 all i can tell you is that mr janssens resignation is effective sept 2 and that he is not in a classroom or on school grounds
8554079 its a situation where youre dealing with employee confidentiality and student privacy

8554081 wir haben die erste runde gewonnen aber der rechtsstreit l uft weiter
8554082 reallocating funds in the time of crisis is an absolute necessity because we dont want to pile a fiscal disaster on top of a natural disaster
8554083 a special session is very much on the table but were not interested in playing political games with this issue like the republicans are doing right now by offering up ideas of tax cuts that would bankrupt the government
8554084 barack obama ist bereit pr sident der vereinigten staaten zu sein
8554085 hillary hat uns deutlich gesagt dass sie alles tun wird um barack obama zum pr sidenten zu w hlen das macht zwei aus uns oder besser 18 millionen denn wie hillary will ich dass all die die sie unterst tzen nun im november f r barack obama stimmen werden
8554086 barack obama ist bereit pr sident der vereinigten staaten zu sein
8554087 der american dream ist unter beschuss zu hause und amerikas f hrung in der welt ist geschw cht
8554088 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8554089 die republikaner wollen doch tats chlich dass wir sie f r die letzten acht jahre mit vier weiteren belohnen lasst uns eine botschaft schicken die von den rocky mountains durch ganz amerika widerhallen wird danke aber nein danke
8554090 zusammen haben wir uns durchgesetzt in einem wahlkampf in dem die republikaner sagten ich sei zu jung und unerfahren oberkommandierender zu sein na klingt das bekannt es funktionierte 1992 nicht denn wir waren auf der richtigen seite der geschichte und es wird 2008 nicht funktionieren weil barack obama auf der richtigen seite der geschichte steht
8554091 gestern nacht nachdem sie gesprochen hatte waren alle die sie unterst tzen froh dass sie es taten und einigen von denen die es nicht taten waren traurig
8554092 the choice in this election is clear these times require more than a good soldier
8554093 they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8554094 ive never seen a time when washington has watched so many people get knocked down without doing anything to help them get back up
8554095 thats the america that george bush has left us and thats the future john mccain will give us
8554096 as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8554097 should we trust john mccains judgment when he says there can be no timelines to draw down our troops from iraq that we must stay indefinitely
8554098 joe biden is right we need more than a good soldier we need a leader with the experience and judgment to serve as commander in chief from day one
8554099 you can learn an awful lot about a man campaigning with him debating him and seeing how he reacts under pressure you learn about the strength of his mind but even more importantly you learn about the quality of his heart
8554100 i watched how barack touched people how he inspired them and i realized he has tapped into the oldest belief in america we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8554101 but i underestimated the intangible but very effective dynamic of joe biden connecting with middle class america
8554102 his demeanor and common sense delivery i believe struck a special chord with middle america
8554103 has tapped into the oldest belief in america we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8554104 theres no question about it that as a community we desperately need to do this
8554105 lots of times folks with chronic mental illness dont have a lot of friends and family connections
8554106 theyre indigent theyre just another person in jail and they just kind of get lost in the process because they dont have anybody on the outside advocating for the services they need to get out
8554107 in most instances its some sort of housing and medication
8554108 they get stable in jail then they get out and they no longer have their insurance to go get their meds so it can be a revolving door
8554109 our major focus is to create a complete whole citizen
8554110 what we do is take and build on that need for coming home and not going back to prison
8554111 80 percent of people who have a job within 30 days of release will not return to prison
8554112 do we really want to build that much housing if its that close to a new jail
8554113 to break through the news media and get everyones attention to get them educated is going to be most difficult
8554114 we still stand on the ground that this thing will save the county a lot of money over the next 20 years
8554115 how to finance it i have no control over nor do i want it

8554137 weve been watching the weather carefully over the last several days and have been absolutely glued to the forecasts for the last several hours
8554138 right now it looks like there may only be two or three good days on this tide and the pilot of wittmacks accompanying boat is encouraging me to wait for friday the good weather always appears to be three days away and yet never arrives
8554139 the backups make these huge lakes in our yards that can take them a whole day to pump out
8554140 we cant plant a garden our kids cant go outside people buy houses to use them and we cant use ours
8554141 this is a frustrating time and its been made worse because of the record rains this year
8554142 if there is damage caused because of this project we will make it whole again we will all be better off when this project is finished
8554143 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8554144 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8554145 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8554146 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8554147 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8554148 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8554149 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8554150 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8554151 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8554152 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8554153 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8554154 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8554155 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8554156 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8554157 les marques ma trisent moins dun tiers de ce qui se dit leur propos sur internet

8554159 im waiting to see if anybody is going to do anything
8554160 i want two people to give me the same answer
8554161 our best estimate at this point is they cannot rebuild in that area
8554162 their options become more and more limited because the regulations are designed to discourage allowing continuation of these structures
8554163 you cant take care of one area without taking care of the other
8554164 were real sympathetic to the homeowner that has a property in the four mile area that was significantly damaged and is now left with few options because they cant rebuild and they cant sell
8554165 one week i have a glimmer of hope and the next week i have none
8554166 i think postville was a huge embarrassment because of the criminalization of workers
8554167 there were a lot of things besides just working in the country illegally
8554168 een koude oorlog zou ik het nog niet noemen daarvan zijn we nog even verwijderd maar er zijn aanwijzingen dat we wel die richting opgaan
8554169 met andere woorden de kleine omringende staten worden beschouwd als satellietstaten die niet mogen overhellen naar het westen
8554170 ik zou niet verbaasd zijn als er bewegingen volgen naar moldavi azerbeidzjan en met name oekra ne rusland is massaal paspoorten aan het uitreiken in het krimgebied in oekra ne ik vrees dat we daar een ernstige escalatie gaan zien
8554171 heel gevaarlijk is en dat men kan veronderstellen dat er nog andere doelen zijn voor rusland in het bijzonder oekra ne en moldavi
8554172 de russische acties roepen twijfel op over de inzet voor vrede en stabiliteit in de kaukasus
8554173 herstel veiligheid en stabiliteit van georgi zijn belangrijk voor het bondgenootschap
8554174 ze willen bloedvergieten ze willen dat het leger de coup nog eens overdoet
8554175 we zijn ervan overtuigd dat we het evenwicht tussen omzetgroei en marge zullen bewaren
8554176 het draait niet enkel om prijsverlagingen maar om een verandering van de manier van werken
8554177 we doen ons best om op een andere manier deze kosten te compenseren maar als de inflatie verder stijgt komt er een punt dat ook wij prijzen doorberekenen
8554178 dat besluit heeft tot veel ophef geleid daarom heeft de gemeenteraad het college gevraagd richtlijnen op te stellen
8554179 er waren geen regels er zijn ook nooit eerder problemen geweest al hebben er al vaker naaktschilderijen in het gemeentehuis gehangen
8554180 de commotie die om zoiets kleins is ontstaan er zijn in huizen belangrijkere problemen wij vonden dit een aangelegenheid van het college waar we als raad buiten moesten blijven daarbij moet je fatsoensnormen naast kunstnormen leggen bezoekers van het rijksmuseum komen veel meer naakten tegen van rembrandt rubens en anderen het is een lastige afweging ik kan me wel voorstellen dat bepaalde schilderijen beter niet opgehangen kunnen worden
8554181 ze pakten mijn bijbel af en hielden me in de gaten ik ben toen gaan bidden na vier vijf uur zag ik dat mijn bewakers in slaap waren gevallen en kon ik wegvluchten maar naar huis gaan dat durf ik niet
8554182 de volumes in de utiliteitsbouw en de inframarkt blijven in vrijwel alle thuismarkten op goed niveau vooral door de toename van opdrachten uit de publieke sector
8554183 the question is based on what we find what can we do about it
8554184 concrete plannen voor het kantoor dat ze achterlaten zijn er niet zegt woordvoerder leon romeyn
8554185 als het allemaal gaat lopen zal in 2011 de plek vrij zijn de wens van de gemeente is het gebouw in te passen in het meubelboulevardcomplex
8554186 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8554187 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8554188 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8554189 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8554190 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8554191 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8554192 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8554193 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8554194 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8554195 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8554196 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8554197 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8554198 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8554199 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8554200 who are open to doing something on the production side
8554201 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8554202 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8554203 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

8554211 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8554212 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8554213 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8554214 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8554215 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8554216 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

8554236 weve been pushing the bush administration including the hud director to get the money out to iowans who need it and thats been a big problem
8554237 its coming from the administration not from a lack of available funding
8554238 its a lot better than katrina and were in good shape to get money out by the time winter comes
8554239 hud remains fully committed to helping iowans rebuild their communities
8554240 calvijn verwerpt de gedachte dat er nog steeds profeten zijn die de wil van god buiten de bijbel om zouden kennen
8554241 calvijn heeft een positiever beeld van de wet dan luther die deze alleen als verdoemend ziet de koninklijke dimensie van de wet is dat god hierdoor zijn koningsheerschappij op aarde wil uitoefenen de priesterlijke ceremoni le wetten duiden op de volkomen zondevergeving de profetische functie is dat de wetten gods wil verkondigen
8554242 het is daarom niet verwonderlijk dat ze niet alleen door de gereformeerde maar ook door de lutherse en zelfs rooms katholieke theologie is opgenomen
8554243 het calvinisme is in itali nog zo goed als onbekend
8554244 itali heeft geen reformatie meegemaakt calvijn is slechts bekend vanwege drie dingen een strenge uitverkiezingsleer de verbranding van servet en het kapitalisme

8554278 the solution may be tiered pricing according to gross national income per capita and according to the scale of country efforts
8554279 recent estimates indicate that if trends continue the way they are developing countries will face a 75 percent increase in the number of cervical cancer cases because of growth and aging of the population in the next two decades
8554280 more research is needed to determine an efficient combination of these new approaches and each country will have to decide which is best for them
8554281 the leaking and abuse of the personal information of citizens of our country has already reached urgency and it has become imperative that we implement a law on protection of private information
8554282 the leaking of personal information has already become a general social menace and moving quickly toward a law on protection of private information is an urgent task before us

8554289 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8554290 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8554291 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8554292 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8554293 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8554294 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8554295 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8554304 baracks candidacy would not have been conceivable 50 years ago
8554305 kings speech brought about a significant outpouring of support among whites for the idea of civil rights reform and even though obama wants to run as a trans racial candidate his candidacy obviously has enormous symbolic significance
8554306 he has to present himself as the american candidate for president not the african american candidate
8554307 anybody who gives a speech on this kind of occasion speaks in kings shadow and is judged in comparison with him
8554308 thats part of the enormous challenge obama has created for himself for better or worse by happenstance or design he has set the rhetorical bar extraordinarily high
8554309 that speech was the first time many in our generation heard him speak in a coherent consistent way instead of the sound bites that wed been exposed to on the news
8554310 obama is probably the best political speaker weve had since ronald reagan
8554311 hes a highly rational speaker unlike king but at the same time touches people emotionally what gives him his emotional power is his use of the language of transformation obama is able to rise above the particulars of the moment and talk more in universals that can encompass people of many ideologies
8554312 in a sense he needs to do something similar to what king did
8554313 to do what only great orators can do offer a compelling vision of the future thats what great oratory is its not just putting words together its putting the right words to match the historical moment

8554318 even in these times when all the talk is of putting history behind us the easiest way to tell the difference between the irish and the english is to utter the word
8554319 i was myself assaulted and received death threats the depth of hatred that still exists in ireland is matched only by unawareness in non catholic english circles of what cromwell did in ireland i am reminded of gk chestertons remark that the tragedy of the english conquest of ireland in the 17th century is that the irish can never forget it and the english can never remember it
8554320 it was in accordance with the laws of war but it went far beyond what any general had done in england
8554321 this was ethnic cleansing on a scale undreamt of by slobodan milosevic
8554322 reverence for cromwell was one of the few socialist traditions that survived the transition from old to new labour
8554323 he was on the right side in the civil war and because of him the right side won he changed the course of english history and changed it for the better
8554324 until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved
8554325 it is increasingly a manifestation of republican frustration at the failure of sinn f in to deliver what it promised to its own movement
8554326 nationalists and republicans will once again be disappointed by the attitude being displayed by the sdlp
8554327 any commitments that were given by the government to sinn f in are a matter for the government but the dup made the situation perfectly clear before we left st andrews that we had not agreed to any dates for the transfer of powers
8554328 i say again that until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved it should not be taking on more especially a portfolio as contentious as justice
8554329 i was outside the family home when the raid began and i was inside immediately afterwards speaking with the family who are close friends of mine the reality of the ruc psni was here for all to see in broad daylight and the residents of this estate remain justifiably suspicious of the force
8554330 most accounts agree that it was south ossetian separatists who committed the first act of escalation when they blew up a georgian military vehicle on august 1 wounding five georgian peacekeeping troops georgia responded in kind killing six south ossetian militiamen
8554331 capt ivanov and eduard kokoity the pro moscow president of south ossetia say they held a meeting that day between marat kulakhmetov commander of the russian peacekeeping forces and temur yakobashvili the georgian minister for re integration whose job is to deal with the breakaway regions
8554332 i would like to address those who are now shooting at georgian policemen i want to say with full responsibility that several hours ago i reached a very difficult decision not to respond with fire this was no use however and the fighting escalated
8554333 georgian president sakashvilis biggest lie was his attempt to airbrush the fact that he created the crisis by launching an artillery barrage on the south ossetian capital which killed scores of civilians and 15 russian peacekeepers it was absurd to think russia would not retaliate so the next lie was to claim russias leaders had prepared a trap in fact they were taken by surprise as much as the ossetians nevertheless russia should pull back completely now it should also have restrained south ossetian militias from running amok against georgian villages

8554336 clintons deputy national policy director jake sullivan outlined several irish policies that would be undertaken in a clinton white house come 2009 he said clinton would immediately appoint an american special envoy on ireland who would maintain an office in the white house and report directly to the president clinton would also firmly focus on economic development in northern ireland sullivan said and have her secretary of commerce and other government agencies get involved in developing strategies for ireland
8554337 in the observer alan ruddock begins his account with the morning of september 11 the day of the terrorist attack on the world trade centre in new york as the us special envoy to ireland richard haas was preparing for a meeting with sinn fein leader gerry adams
8554338 after a few minutes of talking about inching forward towards the peace process haas finally snapped
8554339 yet there were indications that no 10 had more room for manoeuvre than it realised in july 2005 the ira had finally agreed to decommission all its weapons at the last minute adams called no 10 to demand that some of the weapons not be destroyed so that the ira could arm itself against possible attacks from dissident members unless this was allowed he threatened decommissioning would not proceed the blair government conceded but wanted to check with dublin irish justice minister michael mcdowell refused to acquiesce in the backsliding despite enormous pressure powell told adams of the problem and adams gave way decommissioning took place as planned

8554341 605 000 long term immigrants arriving in the year to mid 2007 the eu projections show that the wave of migration to britain boosting both the workforce and fertility rates is out of step with many other european countries where deaths are expected to overtake births after 2015
8554342 trends differ for the four countries of the uk the population of england is projected to increase by 8 per cent by 2016 that of northern ireland by 7 per cent big year that and wales by 5 per cent the projected increase for scotland where fertility and life expectancy levels are assumed to remain lower than in the rest of the uk is 3 per cent across the united kingdom northern ireland recorded the highest rate of growth with a one per cent population rise last year to 1 8 million people the population of england rose by 0 6 per cent to 51 1 million scotland and wales rose by 0 5 per cent
8554343 the uk population reached 60 5 million this year and the new official figures suggest it will rise to 65 million by 2016 and 71 million by 2031

8554345 at least one blast bomb as well as bottles stones and petrol bombs have been thrown at police investigating a security alert in the tullygally and drumbeg areas of craigavon
8554346 i would appeal to everyone involved in the trouble to stop it now before someone is either injured or killed
8554347 this is not a game this is not fun what weve seen tonight is actually attempted murder please stop it now before someone is killed
8554348 discussions on the devolution of policing and justice have progressed well in the preparation for government committee the governments have requested the parties to continue these discussions so as to agree the necessary administrative arrangements to create a new policing and justice department it is our view i e the view of the two governments that the implementation of the agreement published today should be sufficient to build the community confidence necessary for the assembly to request the devolution of criminal justice and policing from the british government by may 2008
8554349 there is no definitive date for the devolution of policing and justice powers we remain of the unshakable view that those powers can only be transferred whenever there is the required community confidence

8554352 this charge of fiddling while rome burns was a problem which heaney discusses in his essay the interesting case of nero chekhovs cognac and a knocker where he recalls how he and david hammond felt unable to record a tape of songs against the immediate backdrop of explosions in belfast

8554354 davy is in that well worn phrase a man of many parts but the whole is greater than the sum of the parts and the uniqueness of david hammond is his midas touch the way he can discern art and poetry in the commonplace and above all the way in which he effortlessly explores i would almost say creates a common ground on which irishmen and women of every tradition and disposition no matter how cantankerous or self regarding we may be in other areas can meet each other and re discover a vital part of ourselves in all of this his wife eileen has played a quiet but essential part their home in belfast has for years been a magnet for cultural waifs and strays of every description an embassy of song its warmth and hospitality a standing rebuke to the image of the dour wee north that is most prevalent among people who have never crossed the border
8554355 the singers house by seamus heaney to david hammond people here used to believe that drowned souls lived in seals at spring tides they might change shape they loved music and swam in for a singer who might stand at the end of summer in the mouth of a whitewashed turf shed his shoulder to the jamb his song a rowboat far out in evening when i came here first you were always singing a hint of the clip of the pick in your winnowing climb and attack raise it again man we still believe what we hear
8554356 its very clear we need to deliver any agreements that weve had with the dup and the two governments the devolution of policing and justice has to happen we in our party have worked for years and are very committed to the process under way but we need to start seeing results

8554362 after that my friends who work at garment factories in phnom penh advised me to apply the lubricant from number one plus condoms on my face every night

8554367 when you start pointing to the dugout and saying all the things that he was saying a guy that respects the game like i myself i didnt appreciate it and i had to let him know
8554368 i guess he did us a favor he woke up a sleeping giant
8554369 theres days were not good enough but we really try
8554370 i was caught up in the heat of the moment got excited a little bit and they took offense to it
8554371 a couple of words were said back and forth but im not going to be intimidated by anybody i may have looked over there but i didnt look at anybody in particular
8554372 mi piacerebbe che fosse messa in risalto la bellezza sia fisica che spirituale delle suore

8554376 overall we had a good balance with him in the side
8554377 he could have stayed on he was disappointed twente didnt have a go because he always wants to test himself
8554378 i took him off because he has only just come back from the hamstring injury
8554379 we want to play with the best and that means qualifying for the group stage
8554380 i felt we were well organised disciplined and focused we were never really under threat
8554381 i felt the whole team was sharp physically we were much better than on saturday
8554382 we have been struggling for goals but i was never really worried it is difficult when you start the season with a champions league qualifier and an international
8554383 i was here on tuesday and they were talking about a crisis at arsenal
8554384 someone said it was the best time to play them after they lost to fulham but it was the worst time
8554385 fabregas is a big player he makes arsenal tick once you see him on the teamsheet its going to be hard
8554386 we played with belief and competed with them in the first leg we didnt do that here

8554417 french cellphone carrier orange has admitted to imposing artificial limits on its 3g broadband network reports say
8554418 it was a mistake to play last season without being fit but the coach asked me to
8554419 what am i going to say to him that i would not do it now i can start to run and i have the strength to face defenders before it was very tough and i could not do it
8554420 it is all over and it has a happy ending i am just another member of the squad and that is how i now feel
8554421 personally i thought i played well but i know that i still have to improve now i have to win back the faith of the coach and to continue playing games like this
8554422 the most important thing is to continue working hard but we have to remain calm and play like we did against schalke more and more
8554423 i know that the fans have always supported me i have repaid some of that in this game and i do not have words to describe the feeling it was really touching
8554424 man m ste ha f rst else f r omv rlden de k nner inte de h r personerna som vi g r
8554425 im looking forward to a brighter future to go and play for an important club maybe in the european champions league
8554426 i wanted to leave them last season they begged me they said that i should stay so that i will come back to serie a and then i can leave
8554427 they gave me their word so they have to fulfil their promise
8554428 i personally watched him play in genoa against sampdoria and during that game cassano did not even touch the ball once such was santacroces performance
8554429 i must say that i am surprised by the sense of application with which he addressed the game always very agile and he has the ability to play for the national team
8554430 in my opinion santacroce is already ready for this level of football
8554431 i am really happy to play in a team like milan
8554432 this is a dream come true everything has happened really fast
8554433 everything here is incredible the people are very easy going and they have made me feel like im at home in the past i have achieved some success to have become european champion with the under 17 national team and of course at the age of 18 to have arrived to a big club as arsenal
8554434 in london i have learned a lot it has been a life school and wenger has helped me today i can say i have reached a superior level by coming to this club i want to give 100 per cent and improve every day
8554435 we might have had bad luck in some recent matches we played especially in the national competition
8554436 but this doesnt mean that we are not capable of topping the group and even reaching the final
8554437 i think well be facing more challenge from african teams in this competition everybody wants to beat ahly
8554438 the teams are so ambitious now and have started playing very well against us as we have seen with dynamos
8554439 but ahly will face these teams to claim the title its our reputation that we need to defend
8554440 we will be cautious and very careful and we have started preparing seriously because im sure the coming matches will be tougher
8554441 we cannot afford to make fatal mistakes because they might cost us a semi final berth which we dont want
8554442 we would like things to be sorted out as quickly as possible and a contract could be signed before next week
8554443 while i am saying that we are in no hurry it is up to the club to make things happen
8554444 i have received a concrete offer from racing santander and portsmouth are calling us practically every day west ham celtic and everton have also expressed an interest
8554445 however juve are working on a solution and we will keep waiting because the lad hasnt hidden his desire to play for the old lady
8554446 i think weve all got to be a unit the players and the fans and everyone in the team has to be together all pushing in the right direction
8554447 the last thing you want is people booing the players you have to put up with it but it doesnt help
8554448 what we all want is to qualify for the world cup in 2010 and there would be a lot of disappointed people if we didnt make it especially the fans
8554449 i was very very satisfied with the performance of every player even without players like essien mensah and muntari who are big players the rest played for the nation
8554450 i liked the spirit of the team and we have a big group that we can make selections from that was an important for me to see them play
8554451 i was happy with what i saw against tanzania and this week everyone will know my team we missed some regular players there game against tanzania but this is a big game and we expect to have everyone available
8554452 its an important game for us and we will take it very serious like the previous games
8554453 thats game against libya a game i want to win its very important that we win that game and i will put in everything to make it happen
8554454 i have watched the first game and you know they were good they are quick and aggressive but we have to vary our tactics too
8554455 i have spoken to technical people who have seen the libyans too and i must work around what i have seen anything can happen on the day as things can change in football
8554456 its a big game for ghana and also for me i am hopeful of a positive result and thats what i would set up my team to achieve
8554457 it is a must win if we can win this one we will go into the break in a really good position
8554458 he agostino was probably ready last week but we were just a little bit precautionary with him so hes ready to go
8554459 its pleasing to have diego back training because he adds a lot to our team hes still lacking a bit of match fitness and he pulled up a bit sore after yesterdays training so he will probably miss out this week
8554460 they will certainly be wounded from the four goals they conceded last week but i dont think theyre that bad a team obviously the conditions were pretty horrendous over there and when the conditions are like that there are going to be mistakes being made
8554461 wellington is a much better football team than that and they may have conceded four goals but they created a hell of a lot going forward and i think that is where their real strength is
8554462 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
8554463 we couldnt complete our plans without john hes vital to everything we do

8554475 the chatter about whether democrats can pick up enough seats in november to hit the magic number of 60 and a filibuster proof majority is getting louder
8554476 its not as good as 60 but its close enough to get a lot done
8554477 recent estimates indicate that if trends continue the way they are developing countries will face a 75 increase in the number of cervical cancer cases because of growth and aging of the population in the next two decades but it doesnt have to turn out that way
8554478 the discovery of hpv as the cause of cervical cancer has shaken a field that was stagnating and we are now in a new era where developing countries no longer have to be left behind
8554479 efforts are needed now to adapt the current price of the vaccines so they meet what individual countries can afford the solution may be tiered pricing according to gross national income per capita and according to the scale of country efforts
8554480 the models provide a useful roadmap for testing promising strategies in the field more research is needed to determine an efficient combination of these new approaches and each country will have to decide which is best for them but we are confident we have provided a valuable starting point for going forward

8554496 the fans have been absolutely terrific last year and this year
8554497 theyll be disappointed people and we accept that as one or two of the performances maybe werent up to what we wanted
8554498 any time the organization makes money its just a huge sigh of relief
8554499 the tanzania visit was just supposed to be a one time project but during my semester at sea i met people and talked to them and started thinking about what was larger than just myself
8554500 the seeds started to germinate in terms of what i was passionate about
8554501 we got a group of 25 students to return the next summer and in 2004 we hit the ground
8554502 in the first few years a lot of my family thought oh shes just doing her thing
8554503 but then they realized i guess this is kind of serious
8554504 i just loved all the extra resources more than everything else
8554505 going back to school makes you realize how much is at your fingertips stanford makes it really easy not every student gets that from their college
8554506 school forces you to question your place in the world
8554507 it makes you really skeptical of how much you can do and how youre going to do it it can feel frustrating and just inhibiting but ultimately the professors and general academic environment and international development pushed forge to be as solid as it could be
8554508 even as a 25 year old she works all the time you dont find that in many people especially if they dont make that much money she also stopped out of college and finished her degree while working full time hers was just such a unique situation
8554509 i hated the 20th hated the 21st which i actually didnt even remember until i started receiving
8554510 have you ever had any sexual experience of any kind with another female
8554511 the decision about cme is really part of a series of policy decisions on the broad topic of conflict of interest that have been ongoing since 2004 2005
8554512 we began with our decision to ban gifts from industry in 2006 this was followed by other revisions in our conflict of interest policies for clinical practice
8554513 there were lots of concerns appearing at the same time congress and various other groups had expressed concern
8554514 we thought it would be reasonable for stanford to have a committee and evaluate the story for industry support for cme at stanford and then to serve that up to the dean with our options
8554515 the decision to develop the new policies is in response to the options developed by the cme task force
8554516 so this has really been a continuing and evolving assessment about industry relations and not a response to some new or precipitous event
8554517 i do not think that the quality of cme will be harmed
8554518 but i do believe that the integrity of our educational programs and their freedom from any bias will be better achieved with these new policies
8554519 current cme is traditionally lecture based whats the newest and greatest as opposed to how do we improve the health of this group of patients
8554520 i think rob jackler associate dean for cme has plans that we will shift content irrespective of funding to better education of improving outcomes and quality and less emphasis on medical facts
8554521 many of the clinical chairs were very concerned about that losing funding and i imagine they remain concerned
8554522 most people would say that its a likelihood that funding would go down
8554523 we want to take every opportunity to put a face on stanford so that the students we really want have a harder time saying no to us
8554524 and we also want to make sure that the students we are saying yes to are really the right students for stanford
8554525 i have gone to numerous send off parties for newly admitted stanford undergraduates and i often hear students trying to decide between stanford and other universities saying that they have had more personal contact with other universities that offered interviews
8554526 also for students from the east coast who may have concerns about the move an alumni interviewer can answer questions about the west coast and assuage the fears of students and their parents
8554527 the alumni can be a goodwill ambassador of sorts for the university
8554528 alumni interviews are just one part of our oval outreach volunteer alumni link efforts
8554529 we recognize alumni as a great largely untapped resource for our office especially in places far from california where we often dont have as many local resources as our peers
8554530 alumni will be able to play an important role in corroborating the other information we have in the admissions file as well as bringing to light information that might not otherwise be apparent in a written application
8554531 but every final admission decision rests with the admission committee
8554532 the small size of the pilot allows us to implement a rigorous systematic evaluation of each interview report
8554533 in the spring of 2009 we will analyze the hard data and also survey the participants in the interview process
8554534 wed like alumni to approach their meetings with applicants as less of a formal interview and more of a conversation a back and forth exchange in which the alumna us shares his her experience of stanford and in turn discovers what is outstanding about the applicant
8554535 i think it is extremely unfortunate that they moved forward without making a strong statement about dui laws
8554536 it doesnt make sense to move forward without that tie
8554537 if they lowered it arbitrarily it wouldnt necessarily be effective in reducing high risk drinking
8554538 there would have to be a lot of work on the front end to get it down
8554539 were trying to get people to support the general idea of debate
8554540 its an issue that most americans have seen as settled over the past 25 years
8554541 an informed and dispassionate public debate over the effects of the 21 year old drinking age
8554542 misguided initiative that uses deliberately misleading information to confuse the public on the effectiveness of the 21 law
8554543 that many of our educational leaders would support an initiative without doing their homework on the underlying research and science
8554544 but the current answer is also not an effective solution to the problem
8554545 i support this initiative because it will allow our colleges to engage in real education of our students about responsible use of alcohol as well as model moderate behavior
8554546 treating college students as adults will help them to make more responsible decisions
8554547 weve seen some very dramatic changes over the past four years
8554548 as an institution of higher education our first responsibility is to educate students
8554549 its not calling for a lower drinking age not calling for an 18 year old drinking age
8554550 and i dont think those adjectives are at play right now
8554551 i was just wondering when someone gets injured say falls from a tree or god forbid gets shot or stabbed what happens to them
8554552 if i found a man shot on my doorstep i would give him some water and some bread
8554553 but what about his life is the hospital called does anyone take him to the hospital
8554554 oh no no no no calling the hospital will bring the police here they will beat us and arrest us
8554555 but if there is no hospital care does anyone do anything do they survive
8554556 i was conscious to say that i am opposed to many of the current governments policies
8554557 i sometimes felt that i was actively distancing myself from my identity as an american
8554558 another volunteer and i wanted to start a dental health project
8554559 we asked at the clinic if they had ideas of where we could get informational material they told us that they actually already have lots of materials for dental health as well as rabies maternal health and other projects all the materials were just sitting there because there was no one to use them
8554560 she was the only nurse on duty for a hospital condemned with gunshot wounds stabs drugs and alcohol
8554561 it is one of the most ambitious projects ive ever done independently and even if it is not fully successful i know that i am at least making some benefit and that i will learn a lot through the process
8554562 its so easy to get comfortable at stanford and caught up in your life there
8554563 theres the potential to learn a lot from time in a medical setting abroad theres also the potential to contribute a lot but if you want to do either of these you will have to be very proactive
8554564 for every love youve ever lost for every love youve ever had for everything youve ever wanted to do for all the fear pressed down on scream
8554565 i hated the 20th hated the 21st which i actually didnt even remember until i started receiving
8554566 the doctors said i have the early stages of pneumonia which a lot of people probably have

8554758 mi sono integrato abbastanza bene in questa squadra dice lanzafame a ilpalermocalcio it questo un gruppo che mi piace purtroppo c il dispiacere delleliminazione in coppa italia ma nello stesso tempo c la consapevolezza della bont dellorganico siamo usciti dalla competizione solo per sfortuna adesso dobbiamo pensare al primo impegno di campionato contro ludinese sono daccordo con chi ha detto che il palermo dovr andare in friuli per fare la partita rispettando lavversario ma senza nessuna paura
8554759 sogni no semmai ho lobiettivo di dare sempre il massimo per il palermo dimostrando tutto il mio valore senza premura e con tanta professionalit non ho in mente un numero preciso di gol che mi piacerebbe realizzare non per scaramanzia ma perch il mio ruolo non mi porta spesso nel cuore dellarea di rigore quello che desidero essere utile alla squadra portarla a migliorare la posizione di classifica dello scorso campionato insieme ai miei compagni
8554760 la nazionale maggiore credo che oggi sia un sogno prematuro magari la mia realt si chiama under 21 domani ci saranno le convocazioni e spero di far parte del gruppo per grazie al palermo chiss che non possa fare un salto in avanti anche con gli azzurri
8554761 i nostri tifosi sono fantastici e lo hanno dimostrato durante il nostro primo allenamento al barbera contro il ravenna c stato qualche fischio ma da lavoratori privilegiati dobbiamo tenere in considerazione anche questo fattore spetter alla squadra trascinare il pubblico palermitano

8554779 only study bible that presents the text of the new king james version in chronological order
8554780 we understand more deeply what scholars and historians know of the earliest peoples
8554781 it bothers me when bad historical criticism trumps narrative structure
8554782 it s primarily a set of theological texts that have historical significance not a set of historical texts that have theological significance
8554783 removes the significance of the authorship through that process of transmission
8554784 i do think you do lose something when you start demolishing any book of the bible
8554785 looking through the eyes of someone who has had trouble understanding the bible this could be a refreshing alternative
8554786 the goal of the chronological study bible is not to replace the time honored canonical arrangement but instead to honor time as the setting in which the biblical record appeared readers who study this bible will return to their traditional in canonical order bibles better equipped to read them
8554787 i just want to focus on the road now take it as far as i can and its always good suffering up a mountain for a couple of hours
8554788 barloworld are definitely staying until the end of the year
8554789 theyve got a big meeting in london the day before the tour of britain which starts in two weeks
8554790 thats where itll all get finalised and well know where we stand
8554791 but we knew what we were going there for we were confident and it wasnt really a shock to come away with a shed load of medals

8554793 povertys down incomes are up and health coverage is basically stagnant except for children where weve seen dramatic decreases
8554794 we still have some of the worst poverty in the country
8554795 pi che altro sogno di restare con te per sempre
8554796 stammi a sentire ti amo pi di qualsiasi altra cosa al mondo senza eccezioni non ti basta

8554798 bella arriverei a odiare me stesso se dovessi farti del male ora sei la cosa pi importante per me la cosa pi importante della mia vita
8554799 isolation the loss of respect and the loss of trust
8554800 it is very important that the principles on which our stability has been based territorial integrity of countries democratic governance and international law are upheld
8554801 we are in a situation which marks a clear end to the relative and growing calm in and around europe since the collapse of the soviet union
8554802 the last 15 or so years have seen a period in which europes borders have been clearly demarcated european nations have enjoyed a period of unprecedented stability
8554803 the territorial integrity of a country neighbouring russia has been violated in such a clear way
8554804 i thought it was very important at this stage to say to a friendly country like ukraine that we are determined to support the democratic choices
8554805 whats happened since the fall of the soviet union is not a western plot its a series of decision by democratic countries about the course they want to take not a course of confrontation with russia but a course of engagement with the west which i think is wholly within their rights and which we are right to support

8554809 lets declare with one voice that barack obama is our candidate
8554810 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8554811 yall sit down we got to get along with the show here sit down please stop please sit
8554812 it is time to take back the country we love and whether you voted for me of whether you voted for barack the time is now to reunite as a single party with a single purpose
8554813 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8554814 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8554815 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8554816 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8554817 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8554818 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8554819 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8554820 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8554821 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8554822 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8554823 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8554824 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8554825 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8554826 no one works for someone we all just work together
8554827 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8554828 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8554829 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8554830 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8554831 you might not have permission to use this network resource

8554833 the association between prolonged seated immobility and venous thromboembolism is well recognized in relation to travel the risk of developing vte following sitting for prolonged periods at a computer has recently been recognized
8554834 he is still not fit as i would like him to be but he has had chicken pox and it has been difficult for him being away from his family
8554835 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8554836 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8554837 to the best of our knowledge the outcome of the probe if at all it has been concluded has not been made public
8554838 indeed the yaradua administration by hurrying to sign a fresh deal with siemens when the company has not been cleared of the bribery charges against it has turned the german engineering firm into a sacred cow undermined his own administrations anti corruption battle and made nigeria a laughing stock
8554839 the action has also shown that the government does not mean what it says which is a big blow to its credibility in the eyes of the citizens and non citizens alike
8554840 recall that in a statement on nov 18th 2007 we ac had warned if ever any government has a chance to show its anti corruption campaign is not a fluke it is this yaradua government considering the rate at which the corruption allegations are being made against public officials in both the past and present administrations
8554841 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8554842 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8554843 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8554844 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8554845 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8554846 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8554847 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8554848 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8554849 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8554850 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8554851 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8554852 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8554853 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8554854 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8554855 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8554856 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8554857 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8554858 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8554859 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8554860 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8554861 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8554862 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8554863 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8554864 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8554865 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8554866 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8554867 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8554868 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8554869 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8554870 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8554871 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8554872 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8554873 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8554874 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8554875 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8554876 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8554877 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8554878 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8554879 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8554880 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8554881 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8554882 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8554883 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8554884 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8554885 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8554886 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8554887 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8554888 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8554889 i am not ready to proceed with the case i do not want this case to be heard in camera it should be tried in public my lawyer is not even in court i cannot proceed with the case in the absence of my lawyer i will not stand trial
8554890 the courts have over the years relied on traditional methods which involve a lot of paperwork that may expose the judiciary to corruption by unscrupulous officers in lower courts
8554891 we are in the process of identifying and negotiating with the banks that will help us in the implementation of the programme
8554892 the account will be monitored from a central point and one can easily track all transactions and it will be extremely hard to make withdrawals from the fund by any unauthorised person
8554893 the verification committee is expected to primarily carry out audit of the existing or planned factory sites in order to confirm backward integration
8554894 i was there at the nba conference when the speaker made the disclosure on that amount i want to get to him later to see what he can give us to start our investigation with there has to be follow up actions on the matter
8554895 i said money does not drop from the sky we have a system we have a banking system from the federal government to central bank of nigeria cbn to commercial banks to state governments we have to look at our system because the banks have consolidated but i think there is still a lot to be done this money pass through a system
8554896 the banks gives us only returns they want us to see or to know but if we have a system where money that is moved is reflected in the efcc there is software that both efcc and the banks will have that will reflect the movement of money already we belong to edmonds group where we can cross check information and it has been working to cross check movement of money outside and inside the country within the banking system but we are working on having a direct assess to money that is moved and address the problem of federal government money being looted
8554897 its a law l dont like but l just must use it because l met it in operation
8554898 some lawyers are trying to convince me that l cant afford to let a man that stole a trillion naira and have houses all over the world to go free
8554899 if you dont take this asset from this man he may get away with it because the cases are taking so long that it might outlive the administration
8554900 in developed countries we have matrimonial courts commercial courts etc i am of the opinion that we need special courts to try all the anti corruption cases not because i dont have confidence in our court system but court jurisprudence is very slow and very difficult if you are with somebody that is very smart and he has embezzled all the money and you dont have hard facts to prosecute the person then he can get away with it lot of cases have been dismissed on ground of technicalities these are some of the reasons why we need special court
8554901 so justice delayed is justice denied meanwhile the person has his passport and he is busy enjoying himself going from one country to the other
8554902 i just want to add that nafdac is ready to collaborate with efcc in fighting for the forfeiture act it is critical for this country we are pursuing somebody and the person is collecting rents from over 100 houses it is a joke
8554903 bloody their nose so you can walk down the street the next day
8554904 let me make this pledge to you right here and now
8554905 its whether or not you can look your child in the eye and say its going to be all right
8554906 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8554907 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8554908 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8554909 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8554910 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8554911 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8554912 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8554913 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8554914 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8554915 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8554916 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8554917 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8554918 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8554919 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8554920 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8554921 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8554922 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8554923 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8554924 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8554925 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
8554926 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
8554927 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
8554928 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8554929 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8554930 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8554931 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8554932 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8554933 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8554934 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8554935 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8554936 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8554937 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8554938 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8554939 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8554940 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with

8554962 youd be surprised how often consumers tell us to get rid of it
8554963 no matter what manufacturers want well give consumers what they want
8554964 while they may be scared by these trends theyll be o k

8555078 the new 2009 business plan create a crummy cheap game practically
8555079 when we have our relievers organized and healthy i think we have the better bullpen with mets closer billy wagner out
8555080 we had lidge ready if case rudy got into a jam
8555081 but then when he got two quick outs we decided to let him go on delgado we talked about it it didnt work out
8555082 im down there for a reason to be used however charlie wants me to be used
8555083 i have to make sure im geared up and ready at all times my mind set will be to be ready at any time from here on out
8555084 now we need to just take care of business the way things are going i think the race is going to be neck and neck right down to the last week of the season
8555085 thats the sign of a good team one that can win in different ways
8555086 weve been able to win the last couple of weeks by sitting back and swinging the bat today we werent swinging the bats very well so we were able to play a little bit different game and it ended up working out for us
8555087 youve got to make sure to take same approach every pitch every at bat every game and not let the mental errors and mental mistakes get to you
8555088 that says a lot for this team how good we feel were going and how good we can be and how were not going to let up until the season is over
8555089 pretty soon well wonder how we got along without it
8555090 we dont see any reason to go beyond this were not going to have seven hour games
8555091 i understand that im hitting 250 and the fans are expecting a lot more than theyre seeing but the word the fan said trust me anybody would want to go there
8555092 i am joining marilyn manson but black light burns is still going strong and i have no problem operating in two bands
8555093 mm is playing a show here in korea where i am now in about 8 hours and then im on the way back home to start doing some guitars with nick annis blb guitarist on the next black light burns record
8555094 borland is an incredibly talented guitarist and artist and his talent combined with someone like manson who shares a similar artistic outlook will make for some truly revolutionary music the combination of borland and manson is a really powerful lineup
8555095 because of its focus on female empowerment young women are attracted by wicca popularised by the tv series buffy the vampire slayer
8555096 young women tend to express egalitarian values and dislike the traditionalism and hierarchies they imagine are integral to the church
8555097 womens ordination as priests and now bishops has dominated debate and headlines but while looking at women in the pulpit we have taken our eyes off the pews where a shift with more consequences for the churchs survival is underway
8555098 gone are the days when the mother was at home during the day and had time to visit the churchs coffee mornings and mother and toddler groups
8555099 with the pressures women face churches must adapt to make themselves more accessible
8555100 what this research reveals is that a lot of people are put off by traditional stances and attitudes we still have a long way to go before women particularly young women feel as included in the church as men do
8555101 im absolutely convinced that when we have women as bishops that it will send out a very clear message that women are as valued as much as men
8555102 i think he took us to a good place in the game
8555103 i wanted to go deep into the game but i threw a lot of pitches and fell behind
8555104 jose has got to remain focused to what happens on the baseball field it is certainly inappropriate to engage in any conversation with the fans during a game

8555110 this is what ive been working my whole life for
8555111 i never would have written it this way i guess i went down to clearwater and cleared my mind i got back on track and now im here
8555112 the last time i think i played in the infield was 97 or 98
8555113 but it was a great feeling being at third base
8555114 it probably felt like the little league world series players you forget that you get paid to play the game its almost like we felt like little kids with the excitement in kind of a playoff type atmosphere which is pretty normal when we play the mets
8555115 the russian side has stressed the need for tbilisi to carry out point four of the medvedev sarkozy plan under which all georgian troops should be returned to their original bases
8555116 medvedev and sarkozy also discussed additional agreements which may in future ensure safety in the areas near the borders of south ossetia and abkhazia
8555117 he responded well and now we feel he deserves the opportunity to show what he can do
8555118 i might have been putting pressure on myself to do too good
8555119 and i think it was a little bit mechanics i went back and worked with clearwater pitching coach steve shrenk he said do this do that two little things and all of a sudden my command was back
8555120 with a view to the creation of conditions of stability and well being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self determination of peoples the united nations shall promote
8555121 i think its going to go down to the end
8555122 i think its going to be a good race its going to be a good fight
8555123 when weve got our bullpen healthy and organized i think we definitely have a little bit of a better bullpen
8555124 im down there for a reason to be used whenever charlie wants me to be used
8555125 i know down the road i need to be ready to do that get an out or two in the eighth at the end of the season these are big games so ill make sure im ready to go in whenever im asked to

8555190 there is certainly no nato build up in the black sea
8555191 the depression will likely become a tropical storm later thursday and could reach hurricane intensity within three days
8555192 it is different to what you would get under ordinary circumstances war surgery is not something that you would learn in depth at medical college
8555193 this year the programme targeted personnel working in hospitals in the conflict zone like jaffna padaviya mannar and vavuniya
8555194 the participants include doctors and others like nurses and physiotherapists involved with treating the wounded
8555195 you have to know what a bullet will do when it hits the body or a fragmentation mine or a landmine and when the wounded start coming in in large numbers triage is very vital you classify cases based on the extent of the injuries
8555196 we got a chance to compare our management methods with those from other situations in the world
8555197 there was a lot of emphasis on newer techniques in triage and treating trauma
8555198 that will help us to gain greater knowledge of the wounds and what needs to be done
8555199 the next seminars in 2009 will have a component in which we will have practical sessions involving the use of dummies for training
8555200 we try to structure the seminars according to the needs and feedback of the participants
8555201 it is not like in darfur where there is hardly any equipment and facilities
8555202 here the hospital network is pretty good but what we need is more training
8555203 we are praying to the river goddess and offering her blood since only she can help us
8555204 the administration is misleading people about the casualty i have myself seen some 40 dead bodies at a village in araria district alone

8555210 the toxic combination of bad policies economics and politics is in large measure responsible for the fact that a majority of people in the world do not enjoy the good health that is biologically possible
8555211 there are examples where health inequalities have narrowed but in too many cases we have seen a widening but that means the magnitude of inequalities is flexible if the gap can widen it can get narrower
8555212 in the uk we have seen an improvement in peoples health over the last eight years
8555213 the key message of our report is that the circumstances in which people are born grow live work and age are the fundamental drivers of health and health inequity
8555214 we rely too much on medical interventions as a way of increasing life expectancy a more effective way of increasing life expectancy and improving health would be for every government policy and programme to be assessed for its impact on health and health equity to make health and health equity a marker for government performance
8555215 people need the opportunity the possibility to take control of their lives but the conditions need to be right to allow them to do that
8555216 the uk is at the forefront of tackling health inequalities but the challenge of reducing the gap in life expectancy is still very much an issue
8555217 the way i see it the real long term problem facing markets with significant amounts of holiday properties is going to rear its head when retiring baby boomers start dying off lots of people croaking plus very few in a position to buy their second homes potential problems worthy of further analysis

8555230 one of the chambers we found two days ago appeared to be an office of some sort
8555231 khaz has been working on transcribing and translating the records we found there
8555232 th first volume we found was just records a tally of the fortress stocks facinatin stuff but a wee bit dry looking further though i found what appears to be the journal of the record keeper
8555233 i thought it could be helpful in our efforts here and ahve translated the first part of it and since itll be too damned hot to keep going for the next few hours anyway john and i felt that a wee bit of reading would help tide us through the heat of the day
8555234 ill keep working on translating this though i will need to concentrate on the official documents this journal should give us a good look into imperial dwarven culture
8555235 how old is that record and the months they used all names of stone how do they compare to ours
8555236 it looks like they are using the late imperial calender by that calender this would be the year 1372
8555237 the months corresponded to the cycles of the moon a bit closer than your gregorian calender does malachite is the fifth month and the second of summer granite slate felsite hematite malachite galena limestone sandstone timber moonstone opal and finally obsidian

8555287 they showed significant stress on the endoplasmic reticulum and the tissue itself was more inflamed than in our lean patients
8555288 we need to make sure our prevention messages are comprehensive
8555289 in addition to talking about avoiding transmission health communication efforts should promote testing as well
8555290 one of the best ways to find college students is on facebook since thats where they meet and interact with each other
8555291 we found that two thirds of our participants were recruited online either through facebook or through e mail
8555292 although several groups have documented that repeated cocaine exposure increases nac spine density the precise molecular mechanisms that control this process have remained elusive
8555293 moreover the cocaine induced increase in nac spine density has been hypothesized to contribute to the long lasting behavioral sensitization that occurs after repeated cocaine exposure but direct evidence concerning the functional relationship between these two processes is lacking
8555294 taken together our findings implicate mef2 as a key regulator of structural synapse plasticity and sensitized responses to cocaine and suggest that reducing mef2 activity and thereby increasing spine density in the nac may be a compensatory mechanism to limit long lasting maladaptive behavioral responses to cocaine

8555304 he was doing a good job of propagating the bright points of hinduism and the missionaries were not able to convert the tribal people as effectively as they were doing previously
8555305 the rest of what happened is something the government needs to investigate and tell the people of india

8555314 the evolution of the cerebral cortex certainly improved the ability of human beings to create and adapt to function in and with groups communities and culture and to respond to pain associated with social interactions
8555315 however the cerebral cortex may also have had an unintended effect of allowing humans to relive re experience and suffer from social pain

8555317 patients who used statins before an ami and continued to take them after were 16 percent less likely to die over the next year than those who never used them
8555318 so even if it appears that the statins failed to prevent your ami it is beneficial to continue taking them and potentially quite harmful to stop
8555319 in the general population the statin discontinuation rate within the first year of prescription is 30 percent thats very high
8555320 because statins are preventative drugs patients may not feel the immediate benefit of taking them and sometimes stop however it looks like this might be quite a dangerous practice after an ami

8555330 in countries at all levels of income health and illness follow a social gradient the lower the socioeconomic position the worse the health it does not have to be this way and it is not right that it should be like this
8555331 economic growth is without question important particularly for poor countries as it gives the opportunity to provide resources to invest in improvement of the lives of their population but growth by itself without appropriate social policies to ensure reasonable fairness in the way its benefits are distributed brings little benefit to health equity
8555332 there is nothing terribly magical about these approaches but the commission provides compelling evidence that they work

8555337 we encourage our players and work to get our people into the nfl
8555338 we sell that when talking to prospective players in the offseason come to philadelphia be on tv get exposure and get back to the nfl
8555339 its great exposure for the organization we want them to succeed and earn more money sure replacing them isnt easy but im always making calls on players behalf
8555340 each year we go by the same motto we can only control what we do
8555341 what need to concentrate on is leave last year behind
8555342 we dont have the major impact guys as we did last year but the overall talent level of this team is better than last year
8555343 i see us like this well have enough guys where well be in every game we play even with the best teams
8555344 we have some veteran players back who played a lot last year but well have to learn fast with those four to start we expect to compete with everyone in the league but well be a team that gets better as the year goes on
8555345 well win our share of games but the key for us is winning those swing games
8555346 we will have speed and we want to be competitive each week
8555347 the key is the offensive line and plan on getting better there
8555348 were pleased with the progress of our skill position players
8555349 well have to be injury free to have a good season we dont have the size up front as we did last year but were a little more athletic garnet valley is definitely the team to beat they have a good nucleus of kids returning from a state final team and an excellent coaching staff
8555350 we have a lot of talented kids but this is a transition year
8555351 its a new new coach and we open with ridley the key will be getting the kids to buying in and then getting it going
8555352 we think well be competitive and we also think the league has gotten a lot better over the last couple of years
8555353 the lawyers are proving how organized they are that they have total consensus and this protest will continue until the chief justice is restored
8555354 we were never pressured out of the league we left voluntarily and were returning as a full fledged member of the del val league to play football this year
8555355 for one steve lennox isnt afraid to play anyone so rule out the fear factor
8555356 as far as interboro players thats a different story interboro players would love to play glen mills and thats a compliment to both interboro and glen mills theres no intimidation at all
8555357 we know we still have our detractors we know we cant please everyone all the time
8555358 we also realize we cant do anything about that people are going to think what they want to think were happy to be back in the league again we know what interboro thinks but we also know the interboro kids want to play us ive coached those kids in hero bowls theyre gutsy kids they have a great coach
8555359 personally i think glen mills definitely makes the league stronger
8555360 since ive been at academy park weve always scrimmaged glen mills and our kids were always up for that glen mills will be a fast physical team i have no problem with glen mills coming into the league
8555361 i know i can speak for interboro kids who i think would absolutely love the challenge
8555362 interboro kids and ridley kids are pretty much the same theyre blue collar hard nosed kids who arent afraid of anything
8555363 they have great facilities they get athletes with size they have great coaches who get their kids ready but over the last 10 years that interboro won the league they would have won the league anyway with glen mills in the league we always played glen mills at penn wood
8555364 now we have two playoff teams in the league interboro and glen mills
8555365 penn wood and chester could beat anyone on any given day i think
8555366 but i have no problems with glen mills being in the league i welcome them i live in the prospect park school district
8555367 from top to bottom it has become a good league
8555368 i think its because of the quality coaching you have in the league now where guys are all getting more numbers of kids coming out
8555369 garnet valley makes this league that much better believe me i know we know better than anyone else in the league how good garnet valley is we used to scrimmage them every year and watched their growth from aa to aaa to a quad a school theyve always had great coaching now they have great talent like i said we should know
8555370 our attitude coming into this year is we dont even talk about last year last year was special with a real special group of seniors who showed great leadership our goal is to establish a new identity with this team and this group of seniors who in my opinion have the same promise and potential as the previous group of seniors we had there are a lot of similarities there but well be faced with a number of challenges every week in the central league
8555371 i remember playing in the central league when you had a few weeks off not anymore the big difference now is everyone has a year round program where kids are committed to football theyre in the weight room theyre going to passing camps over the summer it wasnt always like that with kids in this league
8555372 playing and coaching in chester county the perception was that the central league was two teams ridley and strath haven and that was it
8555373 it has changed look up and down this league there are no guaranteed wins anymore now you have a garnet valley team with its skill players all back and theyre tested
8555374 anything that falls beyond the purview of anthropogenic human caused global warming is not going to be seriously investigated by the ipcc
8555375 thats why the ipcc should never be viewed as a scientific manual it was created for the sole purpose of supporting the notion of human induced climate change
8555376 we have secured a package that will ensure that all households wil receive a one off payment to mitigate the impact of the ets
8555377 the most critical aspect secured by new zealand first was the introduction of a new requirement for the agriculture and industry allocation plans to be further scrutinised by a select committee and parliament to ensure that as circumstances change the ets has the ability to meet these

8555379 we knew we had to take a risk for valencia and we did not finish the race
8555380 its a shame but its useless to grieve for that one third of the season is still left and its enough to fight back
8555381 if somebody has doubts concerning my motivation let them doubt one thing i can say is that right now i am more motivated than ever
8555382 next week well go to spa i love this track
8555383 id like to race there all the year round its the best of the all the track and i hope that ill have a car that works the way i want ill give it all to win again
8555384 the reality is that heikkis particularly strong when hes got the car in front in his sights when he homes in on another competitor then his natural competitive instincts really come alive

8555387 paralleling global climatic changes recorded in north atlantic marine records
8555388 we suggest that north atlantic millennial scale climate variability is associated with rearrangements of the atmospheric circulation with far reaching influences on the climate
8555389 the direct influence of changes in solar irradiance is estimated to be only 0 1 degree c
8555390 the cloud forcing however gives for the above sensitivity 0 3 0 5 c and has therefore the potential of explaining nearly all of the temperature changes in the period studied

8555432 but all i know is that i got to prepare myself like a starter
8555433 this is the best weve probably looked in about 3 years
8555434 we still have some holes on both lines and at linebacker but the team is coming together really well its the same way it is every year everyone is looking up at interboro until someone can consistently beat them
8555435 we wont be big up front but were running a new spread offense were probably going to run four wide in the gun
8555436 were getting more done in less time and well be more competitive on both sides of the ball well be a team that gets better each week
8555437 were young especially at quarterback but we also have an opportunity with three or four kids back that will offset that
8555438 bernard pierce showed a lot of growth and leadership over the summer and has developed even more as a football player we expect even more from bernard this year
8555439 if we play the way were capable of playing were capable of beating anyone on our schedule
8555440 the keys to us are always the same we have to play disciplined and execute what we do
8555441 the kids are working their butts off and we have kids playing football for the very first time i feel good about this team the kids are young why not win now four of our five losses came against playoff teams
8555442 whether we get a bunch of attention or we dont i dont think were going to feel pressure we know what we can do i think were good i think we feel comfortable with each other theres great communication going on so far im anxious and ready for us to get into a real game and see us put together a whole game
8555443 were a pretty cohesive group off the field and i think it carries on to the field
8555444 not only are we similar in age but i think in interests and work ethic so i think its a good thing that were all the same age were all young and in a similar situation
8555445 chris started 12 games last season so hes pretty much a vet by league standards and stews a smart player who did start last year its not like theyve never seen a start in the nfl although stew is picking up full duty this year from day 1 he has done well with the checks and things of that nature he and chris are very smart players so im not surprised at all how theyve progressed
8555446 assignmentwise and our communication i think we feel pretty comfortable
8555447 were making sure we know what were doing and being in the right spots to be able to make big plays you always want to stay fundamentally sound but i think were feeling pretty comfortable out there
8555448 for me last year i was learning the wil and the mik this year concentrating just on the mik i feel like im over the hurdle of grasping what it is im supposed to be doing and when a play comes when im just reacting so far most of my reactions are correct so thats a good sign
8555449 i think its going to go down to the end
8555450 i think its going to be a good race its going to be a good fight
8555451 its who wants it and who plays the best i guess
8555452 games like that weve got to win who knows it could
8555453 weve got santana weve got a big load weve got to go get it
8555454 the other team gives you inspiration lets put it that way
8555455 and when youre able to take that and keep yourself motivated it helps
8555456 but there wasnt a real big deal made out of it well i take that back one of the coaches was yelling it wasnt that big of a deal for everybody else
8555457 i think the accomplishment is secure because we know what we have done
8555458 but soccer in the united states was so small then philadelphia was an exception because the city and the media really showed interest in the team
8555459 i just look at it as a really good experience we know what it meant to us and the fact that these people still make a commitment 35 years later to come together really speaks about the camaraderie we had with each other
8555460 we had discussions about it many times and i still dont know just how it all came about
8555461 i will pat myself on the back when i say i did pick some great americans those kids had hearts bigger than lions
8555462 we american players were kids and had no frame of reference
8555463 i knew nothing about the other teams or the caliber of play
8555464 without question it was the most traumatic time ive ever faced as a coach
8555465 to lose those players was devastating but we had gotten that far and preached all year that it doesnt matter who is on the field
8555466 ive won five championship rings in my lifetime and that was without question the most special
8555467 its an incredible story an expansion team winning in the fashion we did is our legacy
8555468 you have to remember that in 1973 soccer was not even on the horizon
8555469 i can understand why it has been forgotten because of the history of soccer in the united states
8555470 time and again the man who draws so openly on kings legacy refuses to sacrifice an iota of possible political support by taking a principled stand on matters of racial justice that king said are matters of right and wrong instead obama makes cryptic or general comments that leave his position on important racial issues ambiguous or unknown
8555471 he responded well and now we feel he deserves the opportunity to show what he can do
8555472 i might have been putting pressure on myself to do too good
8555473 and i think it was a little bit mechanics i went back and worked with clearwater pitching coach steve shrenk he said do this do that two little things and all of a sudden my command was back
8555474 ken schrader brings practical experience and stability to our race team that will help in a lot of ways
8555475 brad did a great job testing for us at kansas this week and ken will be an asset to brad as we continue to get him more laps in a sprint cup car
8555476 weve told them solberg and atkinson to go out and drive as fast as they can the target is a win here we pick our target events for a variety of reasons here its the strong history both subaru and petter have shown on this event we know we can win here
8555477 theres no the same level of high and low frequency input into the dampers which means theyre not going to be getting as warm as on other rallies the dampers are less of an evil here than elsewhere that said our damper development programme is continuing apace as is the evolution of the whole car package we also have more confidence with the base car that comes from the simple fact of spending more and more time in it
8555478 we need to win the whole team needs to win fifteen years ago colin mcrae won subarus first rally here i reckon wed have a pretty big party if we could win again
8555479 as i learned from yoram haimi of the sobibor archaeological project the reason why prof kola has not yet published a detailed and illustrated report about his 2001 findings is that he wasnt paid by the polish government entity that commissioned his work in 2001 so prof kola is sitting on his findings so to say until this problem is solved
8555480 have led to a more complete version of the camps history than the existing handful of eyewitness accounts provide
8555481 its a little strange but with every movement of the shovel you unearth dozens of objects
8555482 you find as many things here in one day as you would normally find in an entire season in the usual dig
8555483 its one thing to hear about the crematory its another to stand inside an enormous pit that is filled with human bones
8555484 only then did it occur to me just how many people were murdered here
8555485 the research at chelmno is carried out with the absolute agreement and cooperation of the jewish community
8555486 dr nowak is a guarantor that the work is done with complete respect
8555487 due to the demand and limited number of available tickets for the sept 27 game the flyers are in discussions to add a game
8555488 its been a tremendous experience but im going to be honest with you the profession is dying mariotti said
8555489 to showcase your work you need a stellar web site and if a newspaper doesnt have that you cant be stuck in the 20th century with your old newspaper
8555490 we were hoping they would find in our favor but i think its the reinstatement committee that we really need to talk to
8555491 the staff pretty much did what it has done in the past in this case but the reinstatement committee has the authority to make its own decision so thats where our hope lies
8555492 and you dont know the extent of it so it scares you when the ambulance comes we know hes in good hands
8555493 jose has got to remain focused to what happens on the baseball field it is certainly inappropriate to engage in any conversation with the fans during a game
8555494 the procedure was extensively researched and done by people who were aware of the risks and possible complications and that it should not be casually attempted

8555496 we found potential bloggers were less satisfied with their friendships and they felt less socially integrated they didnt feel as much part of a community as the people who werent interested in blogging they were also more likely to use venting or expressing your emotions as a way of coping
8555497 it was as if they were saying im going to do this blogging and its going to help me
8555498 based on the interviews the surveys and the time use diaries it appears that those who do not watch television not only reject television in order to keep sex violence shallow news coverage and consumerism out of their lives but also to encourage family interaction their children

8555503 thats the sign of a good team one that can win in different ways
8555504 weve been able to win the last couple of weeks by sitting back and swinging the bat today we werent swinging the bats very well so we were able to play a little bit different game and it ended up working out for us
8555505 youve got to make sure to take same approach every pitch every at bat every game and not let the mental errors and mental mistakes get to you
8555506 that says a lot for this team how good we feel were going and how good we can be and how were not going to let up until the season is over
8555507 when we have our relievers organized and healthy i think we have the better bullpen with mets closer billy wagner out
8555508 we had lidge ready if case rudy got into a jam
8555509 but then when he got two quick outs we decided to let him go on delgado we talked about it it didnt work out
8555510 im down there for a reason to be used however charlie wants me to be used
8555511 i have to make sure im geared up and ready at all times my mind set will be to be ready at any time from here on out
8555512 now we need to just take care of business the way things are going i think the race is going to be neck and neck right down to the last week of the season
8555513 i had to ask myself would he do that to me and he has before thats the way it goes
8555514 hell probably say he was sorry and he didnt want to race that way he always does well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to
8555515 kyle didnt like the bump from behind but if you look at what carl did it was a pretty smooth bump and run to get him out of the way
8555516 what carl did was absolutely within reason what took place was just good racing
8555517 im a little worried because they completed it quite late its rather hard to grow grass this time of year we race pretty hard and if the cars go off course it could be pretty nasty
8555518 i dont know what the feeling is maybe its disappointment its probably a lot of feelings mixed into one
8555519 you work so hard for something you feel pretty good about it and the next day they tell you youre not going to start
8555520 theres still frustration if they put me on the field a little bit i guess thats what i got
8555521 as far as cliques i hope it doesnt get that way
8555522 but lets be honest there are people on the team that want pat in there are people on the team that want me in thats just how it is i guess well just have to play that one by ear i hope nothing bad comes out of this
8555523 honestly im really not sure if its for the duration
8555524 i think joe wants to see what happens saturday i mean i would hope its for the rest of the season but im not sure
8555525 since the competition was so tight its only right to play us both and see how it pans out it could easily have gone the other way pats a good player man
8555526 im going to have it for sure im going to take it i feel that i need it its another year to possibly take a run at a national championship
8555527 i dont expect to be hearing it in the next couple of days either
8555528 i got more important things to talk to my friends and teammates about than that

8555532 thats what it comes down to i know whats on the table i know whats on the line i put a lot of work in this and i want to play
8555533 in order to improve her quality of life it was crucial that we did something before she attended secondary school it has given her so much confidence and she is now a very popular pupil at her school
8555534 it is amazing to see the improvement that some people make with this device and the reaction of their families hearing someone speak more fluently is tremendously satisfying for all concerned
8555535 her last act of activism was her most personal marrying the love of her life
8555536 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side
8555537 i am so lucky to have known her loved her and been her partner in all things
8555538 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8555539 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed

8555559 i was thinking of cynthia because i knew she was pregnant she was unbelievably scared
8555560 they handcuffed us and locked us up in a cell there was blood on the walls urine on the floor rats and cockroaches running around everywhere
8555561 it looked like a cage you keep a dog in there was no bed no chairs i sat on the floor and let cynthia sit on my lap
8555562 it was the scariest moment of my life without a shadow of a doubt
8555563 eventually id like to sort this out so i can get married well probably get married in swindon because its not safe in the philippines for us
8555564 i will go back to work save up some money and carry on fighting to clear her name so eventually one day she can go back to the philippines and see her family

8555566 when i speak to some players now who didnt used to play the olympics back in maybe 1996 or 2000 i know that some of them have regrets that they didnt play it seeing how big the olympics has become in tennis and how important tennis has become to the olympics its quite a different experience than ive ever gone through
8555567 it is a pleasure to be here with the rest of the biggest tournament in the world i am very happy to have this experience in my life the thing is win here i feel like i win for all the country thats more special no i win for a lot of people not only for me
8555568 its very difficult to explain the way i feel right now it takes i think a few days before i realize im olympic champion but this is for sure the biggest moment in my career in my life i will never forget this moment
8555569 to win any medal in the olympics is a huge achievement for any athlete i think not many of the athletes get a chance to win a medal but for me this bronze which i won here shines like a gold cause i think ive played all the tournament pretty good tennis
8555570 tennis in the olympics has become bigger and bigger it means a lot to these guys now to see federer go down on his back after winning a semifinals of doubles it shows how important an olympic medal is to him
8555571 its different than a normal tournament its do or die its a lot of players last olympics its a lot of players first olympics and their only opportunity to get a medal and become a superstar in their country
8555572 the lawyers are proving how organised they are that they have total consensus and this protest will continue until the chief justice is restored
8555573 a wise and frugal government which shall restrain men from injuring one another which shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement and shall not take from the mouth of labour the bread which it has earned
8555574 with respect to the words general welfare i have always regarded them as qualified by the detail of powers enumerated in the constitution connected with them to take them in a literal and unlimited sense would be a metamorphosis of the constitution into a character which there is a host of proofs was not contemplated by its creators
8555575 i cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the constitution which granted a right to congress of expending on objects of benevolence the money of their constituents
8555576 i cannot find any authority in the constitution for public charity such spending would be contrary to the letter and the spirit of the constitution and subversive to the whole theory upon which the union of these states is founded
8555577 federal aid in such cases encourages the expectation of paternal care on the part of the government and weakens the sturdiness of our national character
8555578 i feel obliged to withhold my approval of the plan to indulge in benevolent and charitable sentiment through the appropriation of public funds
8555579 we must always ask is government working to liberate and empower the individual is it creating incentives for people to produce save invest and profit from legitimate risks and honest toil is it encouraging all of us to reach for the stars or does it seek to compel command and coerce people into submission and dependence ask these questions because no matter where you look today you will see that development depends on economic freedom

8555581 i dont think any athlete will ever be over the pain of experiencing going in as favourite and then coming away empty handed
8555582 but each day is getting better and you just want to get recovered now
8555583 i didnt go into the race believing i was going to get silver or bronze or any other position in that race
8555584 i went into the race to get a gold medal and i was going to do anything in my capabilities to get a gold medal the race isnt over until you cross the finish line so i dont regret anything that i did i just wanted to win the gold
8555585 my facebook account my myspace and my emails have been flooded with some really nice comments and i couldnt be more grateful for all the general publics support
8555586 its really helping me pull through this time this moment it really is helping me
8555587 its fantastic ive never been a part of something quite so big and so spectacular its amazing how people were really getting behind all the athletes its just a fantastic part of my life and ill always remember it
8555588 im going to carry on until 2012 and hopefully after that as well my result there is not going to affect my future as an athlete

8555597 its going to be an uncomfortable day so take precautions drink plenty of water and stay out of the heat as much as possible
8555598 extra precautions such as staying out of the heat and drinking lots of water are basic tips that could potentially save a life
8555599 its a good thing for insurance companies because it reduces their risk but the main benefit is for consumers and the environment
8555600 this is something many consumers will benefit from for example people in the bay area where you have transit choices can take public transit once in a while instead of driving why not create an incentive

8555606 all the things that most evaluators think are intangibles we think are very tangible toughness work ethic football iq leadership love for the game thats one of the reasons new england won all those championships they find those guys so we think they are very quantifiable too
8555607 ive been doing this for 16 years he might be as special as any player ive been around when hes in the huddle everyone knows it he has that thing about him at the end of last octobers akron game he just said lets do this temple won on a late touchdown drive some leaders are vocal others lead by example he can do it all he transcends all social economic groups and ethnic relationships it doesnt matter thats what makes him unique
8555608 coming from a guy whos been around college football and is really up and coming it makes you want to do some things for him and the program this year
8555609 i basically chose temple for a challenge when i first talked to coach golden he said the same thing we sort of clicked right there and then
8555610 i cant explain it any other way its like a kid waking up on christmas morning or riding a bike for the first time that kind of feeling
8555611 you just want to help your teammates in any way necessary i talked to the other quarterbacks when i could let them know what i was seeing out there nobody wants to sit around i spent the away games in my dorm room watching online on the internet it was different
8555612 i think the team gained some valuable experience as other guys stepped up we can build from that but being out once was enough for me
8555613 all i can do is my part i like the pressure of having some expectations with our defense if we put some points up well turn some ifs into more wins
8555614 when i found out i wasnt too happy about that
8555615 the only thing you can do is use that as motivation were not going to change our approach to anything we do hopefully its going to work out the way we think it will
8555616 a quarterback has to play and be smart at the same time i cant try to make the big play all the time ive got the easy job i just throw the ball the other guys have to run and hit and get tired
8555617 unlike mainstream football in the gay championships the british teams are world beaters weve just won the european gay football championship and are on course to pull off the world title next week its great to see our gay teams bringing home the trophies

8555619 it challenges the machismo and homophobia that is often associated with football in many parts of the world gay footballers help break down stereotypes and prejudice they are ambassadors for gay inclusion and equality gay football enhances understanding and acceptance of gay and lesbian people
8555620 we have been spreading the word that football can be an inclusive and enjoyable sport regardless of ability skill technique or sexuality we attempt to mix a serious love of football with a wish to promote a strong community spirit where taking part is more important than winning
8555621 the london 2008 team is dedicated to providing a world class event which will show that london can provide a safe and welcoming environment which pushes the boundaries of tolerance and acceptance and which encourages gay men and women to promote themselves in a positive and healthy manner
8555622 we firmly believe that football should be enjoyable for all free from discrimination on the grounds of sexuality and accessible to people of all backgrounds and all sporting abilities
8555623 we look forward to staging an event which can be both competitive and fun and hope to leave a lasting legacy gaining the respect and recognition of the participation of gay men and women in sport and in the wider community

8555632 we were never pressured out of the league we left voluntarily and were returning as a full fledged member of the del val league to play football this year
8555633 for one steve lennox isnt afraid to play anyone so rule out the fear factor
8555634 as far as interboro players thats a different story interboro players would love to play glen mills and thats a compliment to both interboro and glen mills theres no intimidation at all
8555635 we know we still have our detractors we know we cant please everyone all the time
8555636 we also realize we cant do anything about that people are going to think what they want to think were happy to be back in the league again we know what interboro thinks but we also know the interboro kids want to play us ive coached those kids in hero bowls theyre gutsy kids they have a great coach
8555637 personally i think glen mills definitely makes the league stronger
8555638 since ive been at academy park weve always scrimmaged glen mills and our kids were always up for that glen mills will be a fast physical team i have no problem with glen mills coming into the league
8555639 i know i can speak for interboro kids who i think would absolutely love the challenge
8555640 interboro kids and ridley kids are pretty much the same theyre blue collar hard nosed kids who arent afraid of anything
8555641 they have great facilities they get athletes with size they have great coaches who get their kids ready but over the last 10 years that interboro won the league they would have won the league anyway with glen mills in the league we always played glen mills at penn wood
8555642 now we have two playoff teams in the league interboro and glen mills
8555643 penn wood and chester could beat anyone on any given day i think
8555644 but i have no problems with glen mills being in the league i welcome them i live in the prospect park school district
8555645 she came home from school a couple of times and said i got in trouble for doing a cartwheel i thought she meant that it was wrong to do it on the concrete but they made an announcement at assembly that gymnastics was banned
8555646 two teachers took her upstairs and she had to sit down for the rest of the day and not do anything
8555647 the uk population is set to become the largest in the european union
8555648 each year we go by the same motto we can only control what we do
8555649 what need to concentrate on is leave last year behind
8555650 we dont have the major impact guys as we did last year but the overall talent level of this team is better than last year
8555651 i see us like this well have enough guys where well be in every game we play even with the best teams
8555652 we have some veteran players back who played a lot last year but well have to learn fast with those four to start we expect to compete with everyone in the league but well be a team that gets better as the year goes on
8555653 well win our share of games but the key for us is winning those swing games
8555654 we will have speed and we want to be competitive each week
8555655 the key is the offensive line and plan on getting better there
8555656 were pleased with the progress of our skill position players
8555657 well have to be injury free to have a good season we dont have the size up front as we did last year but were a little more athletic garnet valley is definitely the team to beat they have a good nucleus of kids returning from a state final team and an excellent coaching staff
8555658 we have a lot of talented kids but this is a transition year
8555659 its a new new coach and we open with ridley the key will be getting the kids to buying in and then getting it going
8555660 we think well be competitive and we also think the league has gotten a lot better over the last couple of years
8555661 while i cant speak for other districts over the last five years there has been a greater emphasis on reporting crimes
8555662 we have always and will continue to emphasize reporting because if we dont know whats going on we wont know how to respond to it
8555663 we feel very confident that other school districts are reporting what they need to report

8555665 the uk population is set to become the largest in the european union
8555666 from top to bottom it has become a good league
8555667 i think its because of the quality coaching you have in the league now where guys are all getting more numbers of kids coming out
8555668 garnet valley makes this league that much better believe me i know we know better than anyone else in the league how good garnet valley is we used to scrimmage them every year and watched their growth from aa to aaa to a quad a school theyve always had great coaching now they have great talent like i said we should know
8555669 our attitude coming into this year is we dont even talk about last year last year was special with a real special group of seniors who showed great leadership our goal is to establish a new identity with this team and this group of seniors who in my opinion have the same promise and potential as the previous group of seniors we had there are a lot of similarities there but well be faced with a number of challenges every week in the central league
8555670 i remember playing in the central league when you had a few weeks off not anymore the big difference now is everyone has a year round program where kids are committed to football theyre in the weight room theyre going to passing camps over the summer it wasnt always like that with kids in this league
8555671 playing and coaching in chester county the perception was that the central league was two teams ridley and strath haven and that was it
8555672 it has changed look up and down this league there are no guaranteed wins anymore now you have a garnet valley team with its skill players all back and theyre tested
8555673 i think there should be a literary prize for men anything that adds interest or glamour for boys can only be good sense

8555675 i think there should be a literary prize for men i have a son and you hear a lot about boys not reading anything that adds interest or glamour for boys can only be good sense
8555676 at this point were not saying dont do it were saying how about an opportunity for the people who are affected most by this activity center to have a say
8555677 we know that in our district we need to address the outdoor inequity of the facilities

8555682 today my fridge freezer packed up well actually it is my landlords so i did not get the back off of it straight away i called the support line and they said that they could get the engineer out for 100 i told my landlord and he said he would handle it i knew what this meant a long time with warm beer i decided to get the back off and see what was wrong there was a huge cat size quantity of fluff blocking the vent that had accrued over seven years or so i removed this et voila fridge freezer sprang back into life within minutes everything was tickety boo the only downside was that the compressor was no longer muffled as much as it used to be hence more noise in the kitchen lesson learned pull the fridge freezer out and remove whatever fluff there is the machine works more efficiently thereafter therefore saving electricity i advise you and all of your readers to do likewise who knows it could be warm beer for you too if you dont take the same precautions

8555874 however subsequent communications indicate that the group not only wanted to keep the effort secret from the media the public and wikipedia administrators but that the material they intended to introduce included discredited claims that could smear palestinians and muslims and conceal israels true history
8555875 as a consequence of its campaign against npr camera acted as the enabler for some seriously disturbed people
8555876 there is no need to advertise the fact that we have these group discussions
8555877 anti israel editors will seize on anything to try to discredit people who attempt to challenge their problematic assertions and will be all too happy to pretend and announce that a zionist cabal the same one that controls the banks and hollywood is trying to hijack wikipedia
8555878 avoid editing israel related articles for a short period of time
8555879 might also want to avoid for obvious reasons picking a user name that marks you as pro israel or that lets people know your real name
8555880 dont forget to always log in before making edits if you make changes while not logged in wikipedia will record your computers ip address
8555881 you dont want to be precived sic as a camera defender on wikipedia sic that is for sure
8555882 edit articles at random make friends not enemies we will need them later on this is a marathon not a sprint
8555883 h e is very loyal to the wikipedia sic system
8555884 one or more of you who want to take this route should stay away from any israel realted sic articles for one month until they sic interact in a positive way with 100 wikipedia sic editors who would be used later to vote you as an administrator
8555885 so for example imagine that you get rid of or modify a problematic sentence in an article alleging that palestinian sic become suicide bombers to respond to israels oppressive policies
8555886 we will go to war after we have build our army equiped it trained sic

8555895 at my age now you know my kids are such an important part of my life
8555896 wir wollen immer die zwei besten verf gbaren fahrer haben und wir wollen ihnen immer die gleichen m glichkeiten geben grands prix und weltmeisterschaften zu gewinnen
8555897 manchmal wurde diese philosophie von leuten kritisiert die glauben dass eine strategie mit einer nummer eins und einer nummer zwei die die nummer eins unterst tzt besser ist egal ob mit oder ohne stallorder
8555898 wir akzeptieren das nicht wir existieren um zu gewinnen und all unsere angestellten die fahrer eingeschlossen tragen das mit
8555899 fernando hat im vorjahr viele dinge gesagt genau wie viele andere leute die meisten dinge wurden in der hitze des gefechts ge u ert das l sst sich nicht vermeiden thats racing
8555900 man lernt in diesem sport nie aus das trifft auf alle zu auch auf mich
8555901 lewis ist ein gut erzogenes individuum bodenst ndig und intelligent
8555902 ist ein gut erzogenes individuum bodenst ndig und intelligent sein vater anthony ist auch sein manager und beide geh ren schon seit langer zeit zur mclaren familie lewis weltweiter appeal wird immer gr er aber er bleibt dennoch genauso freundlich und unauff llig wie immer
8555903 ich glaube dass kein anderes team die infrastruktur hat um den fahrern so viel unterst tzung zukommen zu lassen wie mclaren mercedes und zwar in verschiedenen bereichen das schlie t die bereiche sport fitness marketing und kommunikation ein ebenso wie nat rlich auch kommerzielle und viele andere belange
8555904 mclaren ferrari und die fia haben einen schlussstrich unter die ereignisse von 2007 gezogen die beziehungen zwischen den drei parteien waren noch nie freundlicher als heute
8555905 wegen colins ersten sieg hier vor 15 jahren ist diese rallye eine gro e sache f r uns wir m chten gewinnen und wenn uns das hier gelingt gibt es sicher eine riesige party
8555906 bei diesen bedingungen wird viel loser schotter auf den strecken liegen wir haben in der recce schon viel schotter gesehen damit k nnen wir viel zeit verlieren
8555907 bei diesen bedingungen wird viel loser schotter auf den strecken liegen
8555908 ich habe immer probleme mit dem aufschrieb und habe mich hier schon zweimal berschlagen in diesem jahr habe ich den alten aufschrieb weggeworfen und einen ganz neuen gemacht es wird eine taktische rallye und ich m chte sehen ob ich auch schneller fahren kann
8555909 i dont think anyone is going to speculate if there will be further write downs or about the evolution of monoliners weve taken into account the current situation
8555910 es ist nicht nachzuvollziehen warum wir da keinen fu in die t r kriegen
8555911 que ta m re te lances tous les jours apr s les cours
8555912 that is infrastructure spend we are deferring in light of market conditions its about 60 to 70 percent of what we planned over the next three years
8555913 looking at europe there are plenty of challenged areas whereas in north america our business is by and large holding up
8555914 reaching substantive conclusion on the fta is a significant achievement and one that represents a huge milestone in new zealands engagement with the worlds most economically dynamic region
8555915 the asean economies represent a market of more than 575 million people and are an increasingly important destination for new zealand goods service suppliers and outward investment
8555916 this means we protect new zealand businesses access to asean as well as securing a competitive advantage against other countries that are also active in the region
8555917 the importance of concluding this fta goes beyond simply trade benefits the agreement is also critical to new zealands longer term strategic engagement and interactions with the asia pacific region
8555918 i think of my african heritage of the generations of my ancestors who were considered to be property
8555919 i think of how it wasnt that long ago we werent even thought of as human beings
8555920 i think of how that door has been shut for so long i guess i never allowed myself to think it could open not so wide not so soon
8555921 i thought i would die before i saw this day
8555922 now it feels like maybe the world has changed its overwhelming
8555923 ive heard some people say well what is he going to do for black people anyway
8555924 its not about black people and what they need its about having a black man be the leader of all the people that takes my breath away
8555925 this is a moment that hasnt happened in the history of our country
8555926 its a proud moment for america how about we all come together and enjoy it
8555927 they are the artists who put collective experience into words from the longer perspective of years later shaping the communal memory that is what is happening in new orleans now three years after the devastation of hurricane katrina from the times picayune new orleans three years later poems are still putting the impact of hurricane katrina into words
8555928 poets writing in response to hurricane katrina and the flood in new orleans have risen to that terrible muse in virtually every way imaginable some with humor most with deep seriousness all with a sense of responsibility from the 2006 benefit anthology hurricane blues edited by philip c kolin and susan swartwout to impassioned small press efforts such as katrina ku published by the new orleans haiku society in 2006 to dave brinks caveat onus an intricate three part epic published over several months in 2006 the waves of poetry are still hitting this shore
8555929 the most cost effective strategy is to assume a species still exists even if it hasn t been seen for some time
8555930 conservationists should carry on managing the environment as if a seemingly vanished species is still around rather than rushing to check whether it is extinct
8555931 a lot of threatened species are cryptic the question is how do you know how to best protect them
8555932 it s really about what do you do for a cryptic species if you haven t seen it for a long time
8555933 what was counterintuitive was the length of time you should keep for managing the environment we showed that often you should manage for a lot longer without seeing them
8555934 thus the optimal strategy is to invest in active protection
8555935 if the species remains unobserved for a further 3 years of dedicated surveying the optimal strategy is to stop investing resources in conserving this species
8555936 i m not into looking for signs i think we ll continue to make our case europe the united states and other leaders around the world will make the case to russia that this is a very shortsighted decision on their part
8555937 this individual was on his way to great america and apparently that was extremely pressing at the time
8555938 it was very costly and put a lot of lives in danger on highway 41

8555951 six years ago smugglers found a few pieces of historical artifacts at an illegal dig here there were mosaics of a stags head among them but no researches have been carried out since then
8555952 we believe that there is an ancient roman city hidden beneath the soil
8555953 now thats done sharif is showing his true colours he resigned from the governing coalition on monday in protest over the treatment of judges fired by musharraf last year
8555954 sharif is in effect setting himself up as a political martyr for democracy the ppp is worried most about the restoration of one judge iftikhar chaudhry
8555955 but they always had holes or were damaged never had we found a whole tomb like this one intact
8555956 her face startled me at first i wasnt expecting to find anything like that

8555958 the college needs to take more drastic action than it has to date the vincentians should withdraw themselves from the governing council of the college while the investigation is ongoing

8555961 we have recently commenced proceedings against parties involved in the production and distribution of a movie entitled hari puttar warner bros values and protects intellectual property rights however it is our policy not to discuss publicly the details of any ongoing litigation
8555962 we registered the hari puttar title in 2005 and it is unfortunate that warner bros has chosen to file a case so close to our films release in my opinion i dont think our title has any similarity or links with harry potter
8555963 she had a strong passion for the development of israel
8555964 at the age of 15 i joined a social club whose organizer was a zionist bernard cohen
8555965 from time to time he taught us about palestine as a homeland for the jews
8555966 i volunteered to act as a temporary secretary for a zoa chapter
8555967 our store and our home were known as the zionist store and the zionist house people came to us to send money to israel
8555968 the huge nitrogen and phosphorus rich prokaryotic biomass represents a potentially enormous and high quality food source for benthic consumers in deep sea ecosystems
8555969 even if the military is firmly in charge of pakistans nuclear programme where is the civilian component in decision making
8555970 ultimately there will have to be evidence of a strong civilian oversight for the world to accept that we are moving in to a new and more reassuring phase maybe after president musharraf politicians gain enough clout in time that they become full partners in managing and securing the nuclear programme
8555971 there is no indication that the military does not exercise full control over pakistans nuclear assets
8555972 even if the military is firmly in charge of pakistans nuclear programme where is the civilian component in decision making
8555973 ultimately there will have to be evidence of a strong civilian oversight for the world to accept that we are moving in to a new and more reassuring phase maybe after president musharraf politicians gain enough clout in time that they become full partners in managing and securing the nuclear programme
8555974 there is no indication that the military does not exercise full control over pakistans nuclear assets
8555975 the best thing that ever happened to me while serving in the armed forces is when i met my wife and the hardest thing for me this year is missing my anniversary and my wife and kids
8555976 the saddest thing that could ever happen is that i will miss my high school reunion and birthdays this year
8555977 i had just returned home from living in florida for a while
8555978 i was then told that i would not be able to enter boot camp until april the next year because of all the people who have enlisted since 9 11
8555979 after that talk with the recruiter he told me that he had a spot leaving dec 19 2001 to boot camp
8555980 soon after we got married i had received orders to vp 47 in hawaii
8555981 our mission was to provide photographs of surrounding areas to ground forces in the baghdad area
8555982 i was detached down there for a month before i returned to al udied air force base
8555983 i returned home to hawaii on may 30 2006 just in time for nicholass first birthday
8555984 shortly after in the summer of 2007 i detached from hawaii to vaw 116 in point mugu calif to work on the e 2c hawkeye upon checking into this command i would swing right into the workup cycle of getting ready for deployment
8555985 the holiday season was hard on the family being home and then being gone for a short time my job as being part of the team is to launch and recover aircraft off the flight deck of the uss abraham lincoln
8555986 march 17 2008 was the day of infamy for me
8555987 the downs are when the phones are open on a rare occasion to give the wife a call and hear your kids in the background screaming
8555988 the things on the deployment that really make time go by fast is when you get an e mail from your wife cause e mail on the ship is up 80 percent of the time and this is the best way to stay in contact
8555989 i do this program called the united through reading program
8555990 it has been five months now and i have seen some more of the world
8555991 there is a lot of anxiety being separated from the world that you know but to fight for their freedom is all worth it for your kids your legacy their future to create a safer place is the greatest sacrifice that i will make for them i will do anything for my family
8555992 i have a sweet homecoming coming up soon where i will be greeted by my screaming wife and kids running and jumping up into my arms
8555993 and when you get home to press continue on life you had put on pause for so long being home is something that you can only see not to far in the distance i do this deployment for family and for my country so that they may have a long life of prosperity and fulfillment this is my sacrifice
8555994 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really like you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes its all part of healing and anyone whos going through it out there its ok to cry its ok to fall on the ground and just scream if you want to
8555995 we came off the 1997 season at michigan state and played in 98 everybody remembers that we didnt go to a bowl game we come back in 99 and go 10 2 in 2000 we didnt go to a bowl game right
8555996 a lot of programs do that but i think that if theres one message that ive tried to send when we first got here it was that everybody has to go in the same direction i think thats difficult to do
8555997 i think that its important to know we have very very high hopes
8555998 i look at last year and constantly look back and evaluate without question i think that there were some games we could have possibly won we won seven football games but could have won nine 10 whatever it is so again the difference between winning and losing is like that if you blink you may miss it
8555999 ive been here four years and weve had one winning season it wasnt even that big of a winning season coach dantonio always says that youre only as good as your last game and our last game wasnt a win
8556000 we have a lot to prove weve got to remind ourselves that in the grand scheme of things we really didnt do anything last year for where our goals are we just took a small step
8556001 well continue to work to feature him in this offense in a variety of ways
8556002 we have some veterans back some guys that have played great ball there but theres some other guys that are a little greener that were bringing into the fold that need to understand the importance and how they can be a big factor
8556003 hes a guy that can play defense but he can also help us at the receiver position
8556004 hes in great physical shape hes mentally and physically sharp
8556005 he came in last year as a starter if everybody remembers he and saint dic split that until jonal started having all these great plays stripping balls and everything but brandon i think is poised for a great football season
8556006 i think at every position this is the best defense ive had since i got here even better than last year we can definitely be one of the top defenses in the big ten and thats what were expecting
8556007 so i hope its a great defense we expect it to be a great defense
8556008 at 42 i found out i was adopted that was a shock
8556009 i just want them to know their little sister is here
8556010 full house weir said with excitement everyone seemed to be disappointed that they were losing to weir
8556011 i heard it was poker night on atlantis you have something i need
8556012 if i win i get 10 humans of my choice
8556013 covering her face in her that painting of jean augustin franquelin had not money enough to get painting of jean augustin franquelin on the cushion of air as a stepping stone to england between two plump old women are uneducated unoccupied where their only business in dublin wasnt nothing to do something mad and so deep that the painting of jean augustin franquelin with novelty was stephensons sharpest competitor painting of jean augustin franquelin was as strongly engrained in the ravi river splitting the stream ran fast and straight for their momentous start and this transmission of messages by dividing the notes into short or long signals after the fashion of using painting of jean augustin franquelin as spiritualists do today as merely a tendency to facetiousness or what happens once hes dead painting of jean augustin franquelin was one that seemed to alternate between adherence to the seat by a quick spin for driving the earlier acts and putting painting of jean augustin franquelin on a colossal inflation of his young pupil might try the cases of those who made telescopes part of painting of jean augustin franquelin with a rod the venturesome one who knows the philosophic writings of mr thus isolated in a southerly current of air being what painting of jean augustin franquelin want
8556014 why must there be two rain gauges placed one near the ground grubbing for the ministry that being the ordinary observer siemens did not enjoy delightful things as ugly were possible enough the three cross the river flowing heedlessly flowing on like time itself maybe each time a rapid rate to about 150 000 more
8556015 backwards and forwards of painting of jean augustin franquelin by course
8556016 comes round again painting of jean augustin franquelin will ever produce the most singular luck of his neck how life did not turn her eyes on him
8556017 these things have got this huge cultural history to them and each piece is worth several million dollars
8556018 we brought them out on a plane in packing crates about two weeks before the olympics and the customs officials in china wanted to open up all the boxes it was a bit stressful
8556019 originally they would have fitted into an architectural element in a temple
8556020 but after all those years underground many of the feet have broken off so we had to work out ways of holding them up a lot of them are cracked through and you have to be really gentle
8556021 they have beautiful colour decorations on the surface and if you look closely you can see patterns in gold strips on various parts of their bodies
8556022 the only thing you can be sure of is that weve never seen anything like them before
8556023 he said there was only one person i ever wanted to marry
8556024 our first wedding anniversary is coming up this sept 28
8556025 that he had three to six months to live if he did not get any treatment
8556026 if he did receive this horrid treatment he would have a 30 percent chance of living five years
8556027 and he said no thanks and quit working and bought a boat and he lived on his boat on the gulf of mexico for two years sort of waiting to die
8556028 and then it recurred in 2006 just before he and i reconnected
8556029 so i knew he was sick and i knew it wasnt good but i loved him
8556030 there was nothing else to do but spend every minute together and thats what we did
8556031 worked as an electrician carpenter lighting director and sound engineer
8556032 se n o for restabelecida com os senhores magistrados uma leitura uniforme e congruente que permita cumprir com dureza e com firmeza a lei nas actuais circunst ncias ent o sempre poss vel para que ningu m que n o deva ser libertado o seja
8556033 uma porta girat ria em que de um lado se prenda os criminosos e do outro lado os liberte sem fundamento
8556034 as palavras do senhor presidente da rep blica s o adequadas e correspondem ao sentir dos cidad os e do pr prio governo eu n o diria com maior capacidade de s ntese algo de mais exacto do que foi dito
8556035 yes well i am calling from a pay phone at the university i have only just arrived
8556036 only just what kind of layover did they leave yeh with in heathrow two weeks ago
8556037 oh i landed here on time i am afraid that my government had a project i needed to work on i cannot say more over an open phone line but i told you id call when i was settled in so

8556042 oh hes managing things in his own way terrifying his coworkers complainin endlessly about you bein shipped halfway around the world
8556043 i admit working with others is not the same i can say that i miss being on the same wavelength with someone not that i would ever tell him this
8556044 ach its nothin just feelin a wee bit lonely i suppose bloody ridiculous feeling it here of all places
8556045 carson i am so sorry i did not think it is late there no
8556046 i will call you at a reasonable hour when i have an address remind me to get rodneys number from you tell the others hello for me
8556047 we already have a skeleton staff in sheffield and doncaster and once the barnsley and rotherham offices close it is likely the towns will only receive limited coverage because there are simply not enough reporters to cover the patch
8556048 without offices across south yorkshire there is no way we will be able to give the region the full coverage it deserves
8556049 we feel these decisions affect more than just our pay and conditions we work long hours for relatively low pay because we are passionate about local journalism
8556050 we are horrified the stars editorial coverage is being eroded by management who seem intent on squeezing it dry
8556051 the star is a huge part of the community peoples lives and a lynchpin of south yorkshire
8556052 for more than 100 years we have been reporting on incidents of local and national importance in south yorkshire and promoting democracy
8556053 its unthinkable that there may not be a star in the future but unless we act now to save it we feel this is a real possibility
8556054 industry should look at it very positively between 8 and 9 per cent gdp growth is here to stay and this is backed by the numbers particularly the high investment rate
8556055 on its part the confederation has projected a gdp growth 8 8 5 per cent in 2008 09 and said that its earlier estimate of 700 billion investment over the next three years remains intact the finance minister said industry should believe in the overall growth story and continue to invest this was critical and imperative for growth of the country as well as industry
8556056 the proposal has been submitted to the regulatory authorities and approval is awaited reliance wants to transfer 80 per cent of its holding in d6 to four wholly owned subsidiaries there will be no loss of ril shareholder value this is common global practice and would enable the company to enhance its financial flexibility as the company builds its exploration and production portfolio
8556057 someone please tell me when sam and max is releasing
8556058 the virtual system encourages patients to walk more quickly and for longer almost without them realizing it it is not just that they are distracted from the pain by moving faster than they realize their body actually feels it less were effectively fooling the brain and cheating the body
8556059 its a lot more fun than traditional rehab and it can actually facilitate a much faster recovery our test subjects are usually surprised when i tell them theyve improved by up to 20 per cent
8556060 after a stroke or fall many older people lack motivation and confidence and they dont feel steady on their feet so getting out and about can be an issue and they can find the whole process rather dull
8556061 the vast majority of stroke survivors cannot use a normal treadmill because they are not in control many can only hold on with one hand making it almost impossible walking is the best possible exercise for their bodies and this system means it could all become available to them
8556062 the success of team gb meant our reporters in beijing and those stuck staffing the desk back in the uk didnt get much sleep but weve been delighted with the feedback from the editors we are delighted to serve
8556063 to be able to report on the successes of athletes such as rebecca adlington chris hoy and ben ainslie in their own regional media was a highlight of an exhausting but memorable fortnight
8556064 adrian was an inspiration to a great many people and the team is wearing black armbands out of respect for him and the work he did in raising the profile of donors for leukaemia sufferers through the anthony nolan trust
8556065 sudders quest to bring into the public eye the need for donors and raise greater awareness of the illness captured hearts and imaginations locally and nationally and if we can supplement what he did in any way thats a positive thing
8556066 consequently independent lines of contact and communication may have been established with some of the major players on the political scene in pakistan by the white house and the office
8556067 which is why he was the perfect victim for the perfect murder
8556068 youve given my words a meaning i never dreamed of and youve twisted them into a cold logical excuse for your ugly murder well they never were that
8556069 tonight youve made me ashamed of every concept ive ever had of superior or inferior human being
8556070 and i thank you for that shame because now i know that each of us were separate human beings with the right to live and work and think as individuals but with an obligation to the society we live in
8556071 its what societys going to do youre going to die both of you
8556072 their cults all over the world are financed by the chinese
8556073 revenue from our core operations has been boosted by the successful launch of 888ladies and 888sport and our addition of over 1 000 best of breed games will help increase revenue further he said
8556074 phillips prefers to work in the background wizard of oz style but make no mistake he has played an instrumental role in the development of bodogs online gambling activities
8556075 i would not be surprised if the u s justice department doesnt have him as well as ayre in its crosshairs
8556076 the swedish welfare model is strange is it part of the swedish model for the government to be the biggest marketer of gambling in the country

8556087 both saicho and kukai were touted as young leaders when they were here to give buddhist lectures and hold initiation ceremonies respectively
8556088 but they were only able to become leaders with the backing of the influential elite of the wake family
8556089 the emperor thought monks should stay secluded in mountain ashrams and away from politics
8556090 takaosanji temple was built in line with the emperors will
8556091 those were the first ceremonies of that kind held in japan
8556092 saicho saw the list and was amazed because many of the books and other items were completely new to him he made a copy of the list and kept it
8556093 in the list kukai wrote that he had returned to japan to propagate keikas teachings following his masters dying wish
8556094 due to the influence of saichos endorsement many people gathered to be initiated by kukai
8556095 but the ceremonies created an opportunity for kukai to propagate his teachings as they spread across the country kukais influence began to encroach on saichos
8556096 saicho wanted to learn the teachings by reading so he asked kukai to lend him the texts again and again but kukai told him he must stay at takaosanji for three years to be indoctrinated
8556097 many parts of the list have splotches of ink on them which makes you imagine how busy he was to continue with the initiation ceremonies looking at the list you can really feel kukais personality and sense the history

8556117 im not sure its fair to say that ignorance is growing but we need to remember that people are moving in and out of contracting all the time
8556118 todays marketplace will contain a lot of contractors who were not around in 1999 and the early 2000s when everyone was keeping very close tabs on the latest ir35 developments
8556119 getting the message across to contractors that this is something they absolutely must do on pain of a possible tax bill for tens of thousands of pounds is a never ending task
8556120 an outside ir35 opinion given say three years ago may not be the same now
8556121 i suspect that many contractors have relied upon opinions given in the past and have carried on regardless but this has its pitfalls not least because as the case law goes through the tribunals the courts opinions change

8556140 its a good thing for insurance companies because it reduces their risk but the main benefit is for consumers and the environment
8556141 this is something many consumers will benefit from for example people in the bay area where you have transit choices can take public transit once in a while instead of driving why not create an incentive

8556143 baracks candidacy would not have been conceivable 50 years ago
8556144 kings speech brought about a significant outpouring of support among whites for the idea of civil rights reform and even though obama wants to run as a trans racial candidate his candidacy obviously has enormous symbolic significance
8556145 he has to present himself as the american candidate for president not the african american candidate
8556146 anybody who gives a speech on this kind of occasion speaks in kings shadow and is judged in comparison with him
8556147 thats part of the enormous challenge obama has created for himself for better or worse by happenstance or design he has set the rhetorical bar extraordinarily high
8556148 that speech was the first time many in our generation heard him speak in a coherent consistent way instead of the sound bites that wed been exposed to on the news
8556149 obama is probably the best political speaker weve had since ronald reagan
8556150 hes a highly rational speaker unlike king but at the same time touches people emotionally what gives him his emotional power is his use of the language of transformation obama is able to rise above the particulars of the moment and talk more in universals that can encompass people of many ideologies
8556151 in a sense he needs to do something similar to what king did
8556152 to do what only great orators can do offer a compelling vision of the future thats what great oratory is its not just putting words together its putting the right words to match the historical moment

8556163 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8556164 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8556165 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8556166 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8556167 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8556168 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8556169 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8556170 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8556171 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8556172 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8556173 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8556174 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8556175 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8556176 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8556177 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8556178 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8556179 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8556180 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8556181 declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8556182 the interesting and unusual item is that her grandmother great grandmother and great great grandmother plus three aunts and uncles all were married there also its a bit of history
8556183 we are helping michael as he deals with some personal issues and he has the full support of everyone at the club

8556192 zoiets be nvloedt de relatie met de angels niet ik weet er niets van maar als ik iets zou weten ga ik niet lopen klikken bij de politie
8556193 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8556194 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8556195 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8556196 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8556197 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8556198 yg konkrit2 amp praktis2 aja deh ga usah yg macem2 pusing ribet
8556199 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8556200 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8556201 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8556202 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8556203 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8556204 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8556205 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8556206 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8556207 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8556208 you dont stop playing football because you get old you get old because you stop playing football
8556209 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8556210 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8556211 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8556212 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8556213 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8556214 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8556215 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8556216 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8556217 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8556218 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8556219 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8556220 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8556221 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8556222 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8556223 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8556224 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8556225 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8556226 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8556227 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8556228 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8556229 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8556230 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8556231 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8556232 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8556233 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8556234 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8556235 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8556236 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8556237 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8556238 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8556239 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8556240 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8556241 nobody is breaking away and we have to go down there to get a positive result

8556243 hes won twice this year his form has been very good in recent weeks and hes played on five ryder cups and had four winning teams and hes a natural partner to lee westwood
8556244 if you had everybody picking i think clarke would be a lock but obviously nick could see different reasons but if i was picking id be picking darren
8556245 darren carries stature into the ryder cup which is very important when you tee it up on the first tee you want your opposition standing there and feeling that theyre coming up against somebody who has a bit of stature darren has that and monty has that too
8556246 the guy has played eight ryder cups has never lost a singles match and hes due a consideration
8556247 well lose him now for the next two games so that is a little disappointing but you have to live with that when you have internationals
8556248 its a great problem to have and thats probably why we havent used neale fenn as much in the last few weeks as hes been carrying a knock
8556249 we knew kalonas would be going so i didnt want to aggravate that and have fenn missing for the next few games
8556250 kalonas english is okay its not brilliant you have to be slow with him but hes starting to call people now and getting used to names
8556251 the first couple of weeks we left him alone put him on the bench and gave him time to introduce himself in a couple of games but now he wants to play
8556252 we are looking for a run in this competition and that will obviously mean a lot more games this season thats why were trying to build a squad that would be able to cope with that
8556253 if you look at a side in many ways similar to ourselves last season everton i dont think they would have been able to cope with the size of the squad that we had last year
8556254 certainly if wed been in evertons position with a run in europe it would have been an impossibility to have done that
8556255 now were trying to get a bit stronger both numerically but more importantly in terms of a bit of quality so that from a thursday to a sunday we are able to go into major games looking quite strong
8556256 that is something you could do with the best will in the world we could feel quite strong next monday and feel weve done our utmost and still end up in the scenario that west ham had last year the number of injuries they sustained would have been hard for anybody to have kept going
8556257 that can happen to the best of teams but you want to try and make as much provision as you can and thats what the last few days of the window are about in terms of looking to try and strengthen
8556258 when readers see a rare 10 million bike pedestrian bridge over i 280 at mary avenue they may not recall the long list of expensive car only highway projects such as 125 million for 101 85 in mountain view 81 million for 880 coleman avenue 76 million to widen i 880 at brokaw road 68 million for 101 85 in south san jose 54 million for widening 101 from morgan hill to san jose 50 million for 237 880 and 43 million to widen highway 87

8556262 that would be good ive always had a lot of respect for ranieri i like him very much as a manager and juventus is a great club
8556263 they are one of those big clubs you would actually hope to miss out on but we have missed italian clubs a lot over the last few years and i just have a feeling we will get an italian club at some stage and it might be one of our ex managers
8556264 i think it does help being top seeds but i think we should as a club get through to the second stage regardless of seedings we have good enough players to rival anyone and hopefully that will be the case this year

8556275 obama tiene una capacidad muy singular para inspirar a la gente ampliar nuestras esperanzas y unirnos en un objetivo m s alto tiene la inteligencia y la curiosidad que todo presidente con xito necesita sus pol ticas en econom a impuestos sanidad y energ a son de lejos superiores a las alternativas republicanas

8556282 arbeitgeber die ihre zeitwertkontenmodelle als partizipationsmodell ausgestaltet haben sollten diese nun kritisch berpr fen wie einbringungen in das wertguthaben steuerlich zu behandeln sind
8556283 andernfalls kann eine haftung f r steuernachzahlungen nicht ausgeschlossen werden
8556284 arbeitgeber die die einf hrung von zeitwertkonten planen sollten sich f r ein modell der externen kapitalanlage entscheiden welches nicht die gefahr des totalverlust des wertguthabens birgt
8556285 in frage kommen hier gestaltungen bei welchen dem arbeitnehmer zumindest der erhalt der eingebrachten gehaltsbestandteile oder eine mindestverzinsung des wertguthabens zugesagt wird solche modelle sind im brigen auch arbeitsrechtlich weit weniger bedenklich

8556291 der visuelle aspekt spielt in der heutigen zeit eine gro e rolle daher ist es wichtig dass auch der paralympische sport und sein umfeld mit einem kompetenten partner in diesem bereich zusammenarbeiten die picture alliance bietet nicht nur einen umfassenden und hochprofessionellen service sondern bringt sich auch mit gro en engagement in die kooperation ein das ist eine sehr gute basis f r eine erfolgreiche zusammenarbeit

8556302 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred

8556361 everyone was aware of the first charge before purchasing their house
8556362 this is a factoring charge for maintenance of the landscaped area within each particular development of montgomerie park
8556363 but nobody knew of the second charge until north ayrshire council sent a letter to all private residents in july 2008 reminding them that they had an obligation to pay this charge
8556364 the tenants of the social housing the irvine housing association development have a charge already included in their rent
8556365 i must say at this stage that we are not against paying a fee but want assurances that this will not rise dramatically when the ownership of the land is transferred to scottish woodlands limited
8556366 the deed of conditions of the houses were drawn up by north ayrshire council and these were made known to the developer and they also contain details of our legal obligation regarding the maintenance of the landscaped area
8556367 north ayrshire council selected scottish woodlands limited which is a reputable organisation

8556401 well also have a childrens area in the park so at 6 p m we can take down the childrens area on the terrace level to accommodate a larger crowd at the state street stage
8556402 i think what happens is people get there and they automatically go to the upper stage because its crown center and thats where you go
8556403 but the other stage is just as big and the sound is just as powerful and with the city as a backdrop its a real pretty stage
8556404 we were sure given the economic climate that travel would go down but were now about 300 close to 400 rooms up from last year
8556405 because crown center owns the westin and the hyatt they are our sponsor hotels so we do blocks of rooms through them were close to 2 000 rooms sold for the irish fest block and last year we did around 1 600 to 1 700 so thats our best estimate of what were looking at this year
8556406 our online presale is only about 60 tickets no one buys until the week of we sell like 50 000 worth online so its all the week of its the nature of the buyer plus everyone staying in the hotels gets two tickets per night
8556407 its a little difficult to get them up there and to clean them
8556408 but we found a guy who will work with us a lot of the congestion last year came from people going downstairs to go to the restroom this should reduce some of the traffic in the lower level
8556409 more of a living history area than just a display
8556410 es ist im moment nicht so dass es sich in ruhe arbeiten l sst wir m ssen jetzt schnell erfolg haben damit sich alles beruhigt

8556417 the jury found that at some point the dolls infringed but the question is was it the earlier dolls or the later dolls or all of them
8556418 without a special verdict form its difficult to see how an injunction would be styled
8556419 guns n roses representatives have been made aware of the arrests and are leaving the matter to the authorities
8556420 chinese democracy is a much anticipated and repeatedly delayed new album by guns n roses that is more than 10 years in the making
8556421 we regret that we missed the opportunity to tell matthew mitchams story and apologise for this unintentional omission
8556422 serious signal for those are trying to justify the aggression
8556423 recycling is one solution but its just a small part of the puzzle
8556424 theres nothing about the tests that is designed to create anxiety or create a sense of evaluation or create a sense of being compared to someone else
8556425 once the information is available the potential exists for school administrators to use it to track students and make premature assessments
8556426 were teaching kids how to get the right answers not how to find the knowledge
8556427 what prosecutors oftentimes want is an admission on the part of the public official and resignation
8556428 its a significant bargaining chip that he has if hes already removed from office then that certainly could have a possible impact on the plea negotiations
8556429 if he wants to leave the criminal cases he is going to need to do it before the removal is resolved
8556430 or you take your chances by going through the removal proceedings you fight that fight and see what happens
8556431 there are public officials who survive these trials and continue in office
8556432 there also are public officials who fight their cases get convicted and serve more time in jail than they would have if they had pleaded guilty or resigned
8556433 the governor is the sole tribunal in removal proceedings with no right of appeal or review afforded the accused
8556434 if the governor acts within the law the governors decision is final
8556435 but i dont believe the question about an appeal has ever been raised
8556436 the plan is to consult with court managers to determine in each court what is the best way we can achieve the savings we need while having the least impact on public access to the courts
8556437 the kinds of questions were asking are should all the courts be closed the same half day each week does it make sense to have some courts closed at different times were pretty much into that kind of micro planning at the moment
8556438 its definitely not going to be to anybodys advantage to close it everything will just get backed up i dont think its such a good idea
8556439 we dont have any illusions in the judicial branch about the somewhat pessimistic economic news that were facing
8556440 the court system knows that it needs to participate with everyone else in government and with all vermonters in identifying ways to make it through this tough time
8556441 then welcome home this is your place and were glad to have you
8556442 his great society legislation made it possible for children of color and of humble origins like senator obama to fulfill their dreams dreams to get the best education dreams for the chance to vote and be voted for
8556443 the court finds that the ordinance as written is too ambiguous to be enforceable
8556444 we feel this ordinance regulates quality of life issues which are of ultimate importance to residents in our unincorporated areas
8556445 our intent was not to put any catering trucks out of business but to ensure fairness to our residents those who live in homes right in front of or across the street from where trucks do business everyday all hours of the day or night
8556446 if you cant manage your restaurant business in a way so that you can compete with a taco truck maybe you should find another business
8556447 this law hurt us it favors some businesses over others and makes a hardworking person into a delinquent
8556448 i think so many opportunities and warnings have been given to the website which are not heeded and im sure they mcmc have exercised their authority well and within the law
8556449 but when you publish contents that are deemed defamatory or slanderous to other people i think its only natural looking at their power in order to bring law and order within the country for them to take the action they considered necessary
8556450 hey mom im stepping out to return the necklace you stole borrowed ill be back in a few hours
8556451 somehow in the short span of a single dance theyd passed the barriers of strangers into an intimacy hed never felt with anyone before
8556452 h is lack of title his ability to shift into a horse and his tattered clothes only made him more appealing to her
8556453 i really went back to our roots went back to our costumes from our original stage shows
8556454 the words for me on this collection are flirtatious fashion and fun
8556455 we are thrilled to be partnering with the pussycat dolls
8556456 as canadas lingerie leader la senza is known for carrying collections that are stylish appealing and on trend this new line further underlines our commitment to showcasing fashion lingerie at reasonable prices
8556457 there were a lot of concerns about how fast the economy was slowing with this strong capital expenditure theres a possibility that the gdp for the second quarter will be better than expected
8556458 the rba may not be as aggressive in its rate cuts

8556460 after a period of rapid growth and the acquisition over two years of businesses in five countries mecoms focus now is on developing and strengthening its position as a major european regional newspaper publishing group and content business
8556461 in this we will now benefit not only from keiths extensive in depth knowledge of the group which he will apply in a commercial and strategic role focusing on optimising group operations and leading the groups m amp a mergers and acquisitions activities but also from johns substantial financial expertise allied with the knowledge of mecoms operations that he has gained since joining us
8556462 an excellent cfo giving clear guidance and explanations of the numbers just what mecom needs
8556463 australia is not immune to sexual slavery it hasnt stopped the sad tragedy of this is we are still acting for women this situation is going on on a daily basis in australia its behind closed doors and run by very well organised international crime syndicates
8556464 we have brought the product to market as quickly as possible in light of the active hurricane season we are experiencing in the atlantic this year
8556465 people in areas threatened by severe tropical weather can use the new iphone service along with our regular mobile site to keep themselves and their families safe when they dont have access to a computer
8556466 its got to do with education and a lack of staffing and a lack of resources
8556467 we know if residents have more one on one attention we wouldnt need as many sedatives
8556468 its better to manage them through reducing the use of tea and coffee and giving hot milky drinks rather than giving sleeping tablets
8556469 its important to try other strategies rather than move straight on to medications that help people sleep and sedate them
8556470 the higher oil price doesnt help the transport sector either
8556471 harvey norman will give indications of how consumers are faring
8556472 we can confirm that fairfax newspapers will be published tomorrow as normal
8556473 this was a motion that arose spontaneously from the floor of the meeting because people are angry at the way the company has treated them both in terms of enterprise agreement negotiations and also the redundancy announcements he said
8556474 this would be the end of fairfax as we know it
8556475 its not possible to continue to produce the level of quality journalism fairfax is known for with 550 fewer staff
8556476 were determined to use every option we have to stop the company from screwing the business that some of these people have been worked 20 or 30 years for
8556477 they wanted to signal to management they want to be involved and negotiated with and consulted by the company as to what plans management has for fairfax media rather than be treated dismissively and communicated to by email
8556478 they believe the new management team that has come in since the merger with rural press is all about low cost and low quality journalism which isnt good for anyone
8556479 its not good for the paper not good for the journalists and not good for the communities they serve
8556480 the home offices recognition for the impact of our work in the community confirms our staffs everyday experience
8556481 people in painthorpe are working together to achieve considerable changes which have reduced crime
8556482 we wont be slowing down the pace and will continue listening to our tenants and delivering services that make a difference to them
8556483 these statistics recognise the excellent team efforts of police and local agencies working together in local communities to reduce crime producing some tremendous results compared to the 2006 7 figures overall crime reduced by 10
8556484 challenges remain to drive down crime further and make faster improvements in addressing the issues that matter most to local communities in yorkshire amp the humber
8556485 getting good advice from a knowledgeable partner is paramount it is not just the purchase of the stock but also which trainer to put it with the associated costs of training and upkeep and choosing where and when to run that are important
8556486 we purchased hasty prince for 18 000 in 2002 over the next few years he cost 40 000 to upkeep and run in that time he took a total of 110 000 in prize money before being sold for 250 000
8556487 the chances of that kind of return in our experience are about one in ten however that is not to say that the other nine horses lose money some will but most at least cover their costs or make a small to medium profit
8556488 the chances of finding that one in ten are measurably increased if you get good advice from the outset
8556489 the lda is dedicated to creating a lasting olympic legacy which will improve the quality of life for londoners and economic growth in the capital
8556490 our programmes have been focused on ensuring as many people as possible are in a position to benefit from the employment business and sporting opportunities linked to the 2012 games we are delivering a legacy now for london
8556491 the study corroborated research findings of past happiness studies suggesting that unemployment hurts but it hurts less when there are more unemployed people around you
8556492 this also highlights the importance of social justice issues and social and spatial inequalities in determining happiness
8556493 there really is something about the intrinsic nature of places which can influence happiness and wellbeing the environment lack of green spaces air and noise pollution crime rates all of these influence happiness
8556494 what is clear is that b triples have been operating in victoria on victorian roads now for 13 years without incident
8556495 following that successful trial what were encouraging governments to do is to have a network identified for the use of b triples which are higher productivity and safer vehicles
8556496 this was the secret plan that they were keeping from communities this was the plan that was going to be buried in a transport plan in november
8556497 nous avons pris en compte les arguments de apple que la publicit offrait toutes les possibilit s en d tail mais vu que le slogan d clare
8556498 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam
8556499 this trend is pretty astounding but what i make of it is that catholic school boards face parents who have a choice and as a result they may manage their resources better

8556776 una pratica molto in uso per il rinnovo dei comites
8556777 in starters zware turnarounds en buitenlandse bedrijven investeren we niet
8556778 de eerste ontmoeting is allesbepalend er moet een persoonlijke klik zijn want ik investeer omdat ik het leuk vind
8556779 natuurlijk begrijp ik dat een ondernemer een technisch idee niet volledig vrij wil geven maar vaak krijg je daardoor maar een half verhaal het handigste is om direct te vertellen dat je niet alles wilt prijsgeven anders kan er een sfeer van wantrouwen ontstaan
8556780 geld is een slechte motivator als het alleen daarom draait is het gedoemd te mislukken geld is alleen het middel de vraag is is de bezieling van de ondernemer zo groot dat hij door blijft gaan als het tegenzit
8556781 als hij echt in zijn eigen verhaal gelooft zal hij er zo veel mogelijk eigen geld in willen steken
8556782 het geld moet gebruikt worden voor nieuwe producten een overname of groei om van vier naar tien vestigingen te gaan bijvoorbeeld we kopen geen aandelen van de ondernemer
8556783 het is handig maar niet noodzakelijk als een ondernemer begint te vertellen zijn ogen gaan glimmen en hij pas na anderhalf uur ophoudt dan vind ik dat net zo mooi

8556794 cdr499 to slash it to 4 99 with free shipping its the lowest total price weve ever seen for a custom calendar your image is printed onto the calendar
8556795 i can calculate the motions of heavenly bodies but not the madness of people
8556796 we know theres a correlation between recession and claims activity but quantifying that impact is difficult its not that we wish to ignore it its just very challenging
8556797 most people try to learn lessons from the past but the curved ball of the future will always be something different
8556798 while we cannot predict the exact perils that might give rise to a liability catastrophe we can identify which portfolios might be more vulnerable to an event
8556799 in the current circumstances i think it was a problem of people getting carried away the risk assessment instruments were there and people were using them but they essentially ignored them
8556800 weve got good models and well go on refining them but my view is that the problem isnt the model but the people making the decisions based on them and this is why you get something like the dotcom crash its terrible when it happens but people gradually recover and forget
8556801 this employment first represents a great step in our air forces ability to deliver precise effects across the spectrum of combat
8556802 the first combat employment of this weapon is the validation of the exacting hard work of an entire team of professionals who developed tested and fielded this weapon on an extremely short timeline based on an urgent needs request we established in the combat zone
8556803 we have consistently used precision guided weapons to engage stationary threats with superb combat effects
8556804 this weapon allows our combat pilots to engage a broad range of moving targets with dramatically increased capabilities and it increases our ability to strike the enemy throughout a much much broader engagement envelope
8556805 teamwork was the name of the game to accomplish this
8556806 from the experts in our air force materiel command who shaped our requirements then developed tested and fielded the weapon to our aircraft maintainers our munitions airmen and weapons loaders and everyone in between they made the operational employment of this weapon possible
8556807 at times it can be frightening when you see the devastating injuries but we have an amazing level of sophistication in the military medical corps
8556808 there are always tears smiles hugs and sighs of relief
8556809 i remember one patient was a young kid from georgia he was a katrina refugee his family had lost everything during the hurricane so he joined the air force for a new life and then an ied improvised explosive device blew his foot off but he still had a positive attitude
8556810 sometimes we are the only direct communication between the medical crews and the aircrew flying the plane
8556811 when we have a patient go into respiratory distress we need to let the rest of the aircrew know so they can make alternate landing plans if necessary
8556812 we were supporting the basic airborne course at fort benning ga at the basic airborne training school lawson army air field
8556813 the other c 130 was down for maintenance and this meant we had to fly the missions of two aircraft with one plane
8556814 these soldiers were training to be airborne rangers special ops and other critical roles most of them were headed to the aor in the coming months
8556815 you have no idea where tacc missions will take you
8556816 last spring we had a mission that took us to greensville sc where we picked up the baby we flew the baby to lackland afb in texas there were more than 30 people on that flight trying to help this little baby make it the last i heard the baby was doing great now thats an exciting mission
8556817 the success of the tacc flights is due entirely to the efforts of all the individuals who fly and support the missions
8556818 to date more than sixty 440th airmen have supported the mission this includes flight crew maintainers life support and administrative specialists
8556819 we are very pleased to reopen founders plaza to the thousands of local citizens and tourists from around the world who make a visit to dfw to learn more about aviation and how our airport powers the north texas economy
8556820 founders plaza is a community treasure and a place where we are proud to host the public we hope it serves as an inspiration and fuels the imagination of all who want to understand aviation and history of flight in north texas and continue the legacy
8556821 founders plaza is the premier aviation viewing area in north texas and considered one of the best in the world
8556822 it is truly a place that aviation education and technology come together for the young people of our region and indeed visitors from around the globe and its new location will allow even easier access to tourists who come to north texas and want to do something fun and free with the family
8556823 the hijackers surrendered without any violence and the crew are safe and sound

8556827 we just let them know that we would not be paying a fine by the 29th and that we wanted to have additional discussions its just another step in this process and we certainly hope to continue those discussions to come up with a fair and reasonable conclusion
8556828 i really cant speculate on whether thats the course of action we would take all i can say is that we are continuing to discuss the issue with southwest this week but really i cant speculate on what the resolution might be

8556830 by working with aviall to distribute all jt9d spare parts we can offer enhanced value to our customers while simultaneously managing our inventory and supply chain more effectively

8556832 this is an exciting opportunity for both pratt amp whitney and for aviall it is a perfect match of their exceptional products and our aftermarket expertise
8556833 the signing of this agreement is another step in expanding our diverse business portfolio for continued long term growth
8556834 our members are telling us that it makes no sense to mandate training for pilots wholl never fly in the adiz and they cant see the logic of forcing pilots who are already flying in the adiz or have been cleared for the flight restricted zone to take a course to teach them what they already know
8556835 some pilots are also confused about which course they have to take and whether theyve already met the requirement
8556836 our sources tell us that security agencies pushed the faa pretty hard on this
8556837 armadillo is an important partner to the rocket racing league and were thrilled with our initial test flights

8556839 were happy to share in the success of the rocket racer test flights now equipped with our engines in addition to these test flights we have done about 75 test burns all to secure the safety of the aircraft now were aiming to build at least five more engines for the rocket racing league and continue our mission of providing a system that will not only be cost effective and robust for the teams involved but safe for the pilots and the thousands of fans in attendance at rocket racing league events

8556851 isolation the loss of respect and the loss of trust
8556852 there is no question of launching an all out war with russia
8556853 indeed that has happened over the last two weeks the question though for russia is whether it wants to suffer the isolation the loss of respect and the loss of trust that comes from that
8556854 the strength in durable goods is just the latest indication that manufacturing is actually holding in quite well and thats a really big plus

8556858 barack obama is ready to lead and restore american leadership in the world barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8556859 when he cannot convert our adversaries into partners he will stand up to them
8556860 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than the example of our power
8556861 i will never forget the parents of children with autism and other serious conditions who told me on the campaign trail that they couldnt afford healthcare and couldnt qualify their children on medicaid unless they quit their job and starve or got a divorce are these the family values the republicans are so proud of
8556862 its the republican philosophy the american people never actually had a chance to see in action fully until 2001 when the republicans finally gained control of both the white house and the congress then we saw what would happen to america if the policies they had talked for decades actually were implemented and look what happened
8556863 they actually want us to reward them for the last eight years by giving them four more thanks but no thanks
8556864 we must listen and lead by example because even a country as powerful as the united states needs some friends in this world
8556865 for those who still believe in a myth of a maverick instead of a reality of a politician i say lets compare senator mccain to candidate mccain
8556866 talk about being for it before youre against it before he ever debates barack obama john mccain should finish the debate with himself

8556870 j sab amos que o real madrid ia encarar o jogo como se fosse oficial a sua efic cia atacante e grande capacidade t cnica e a nossa falta de agressividade defensiva fizeram com que a primeira parte fosse fatal para n s n o se pode dar tanto espa o a um advers rio destes
8556871 fomos melhores na segunda parte fizemos coisas boas e conseguimos de alguma forma maquilhar o resultado com a obten o de mais dois golos temos de reflectir seriamente sobre o que aconteceu no primeiro per odo n o nos deixemos enganar
8556872 quem sofreu os cinco golos foi toda a equipa n o apenas o sector defensivo e o guarda redes fiquei de alguma forma desiludido com a nossa produ o na primeira parte

8556875 weve seen some pretty egregious examples that dont fit a misdemeanor
8556876 we want to make sure that we dont make it so hostile to potential candidates that we cant get people to run for office
8556877 and we also want to make sure we dont create felony penalties for everything so that weve got so many in prison for campaign finance violations that we dont have room for people who commit violent crimes
8556878 the indictments and convictions will continue until either the leadership of the general assembly decides to change the culture of the institution or voters adopt a throw the bums out mentality

8556885 todo lo que he aprendido en mis ocho a os como presidente y en el trabajo que he hecho desde entonces en am rica y alrededor del mundo me ha convencido de que barack obama es el hombre para este puesto
8556886 we are determined to have a policy that works we refuse to have a policy that names and shames and benefits no one
8556887 the results demonstrate this policy is working its about reducing the number of afl players using illicit drugs
8556888 yes there are a greater number in total but the rate and percentage of players testing positive because of our increased testing continues to decline
8556889 it gives us great encouragement this policy is making a difference

8556903 die thermale lasertechnologie der suprasetter hat sich seit einf hrung der modellreihe im jahr 2004 bestens bew hrt und wurde seitdem kontinuierlich weiterentwickelt sie steht f r sichere stabile prozesse und hohe belichtungsqualit t mit den neuen modellen steht unseren kunden in der vorstufe des neuen gro formats die qualitativ gleiche spitzentechnologie wie bei den druckmaschinen zur verf gung
8556904 die ergebnisse der umfragen belegen eindrucksvoll dass die deutsche und die europ ische bev lkerung auf eine neue modellpolitik der europ ischen automobilhersteller warten sie sind sogar bereit f r effiziente autos mehr geld zu zahlen weil es sich auf dauer rechnen wird und das klima wesentlich entlastet demgegen ber ist es ein skandal wie derzeit die deutschen abgeordneten im europaparlament insbesondere die der cdu und csu eins zu eins die interessen der autoindustrie verfolgen und anstatt die markteinf hrung sparsamer und klimaschonender neuwagen zu forcieren die grenzwerte verw ssern und ihre einf hrung bis ins jahr 2015 verz gern wollen
8556905 der monatliche arbeitsmarktbericht spiegelt nicht die gesamte arbeitsmarkt und besch ftigungspolitik wider und schon gar nicht deren qualit t
8556906 die sch ngef rbte statistik dient auch im august lediglich zur verschleierung der tatsache dass die regierenden es nicht verm gen den arbeitsmarkt im interesse der mehrheit der bev lkerung zu regeln
8556907 dass mehr menschen eine arbeit haben bedeutet noch lange nicht dass es sich auch um eine gut bezahlte und sichere arbeit handelt die neuesten zahlen zu lohngef lle und einkommensunterschieden in deutschland zeigen das deutlich w hrend das einkommen der besserverdienenden in den vergangenen zehn jahren gestiegen ist m ssen menschen mit niedrigen l hnen inzwischen mit durchschnittlich 14 prozent weniger geld auskommen die gute konjunktur hat in den vergangenen monaten zwar zur einstellung von mehr arbeitskr ften gef hrt die meisten von ihnen werden jedoch schlecht bezahlt von ende 2004 bis anfang 2007 ist die zahl der vollzeitbesch ftigten menschen die zus tzlich hartz iv bekommen um 73 prozent gewachsen diese art von arbeitsmarktpolitik verdient ihren namen nicht wann verabschiedet sich die bundesregierung endlich vom neoliberalen mainstream irrglauben der markt k nne die probleme der gesellschaftlichen arbeit sowie der aus und weiterbildung l sen eine andere arbeitsmarktpolitik muss her eine die f r die menschen gut ist und nicht f r die selbstbeweihr ucherung der gro en koalition

8557075 the recent news in the las vegas nevada politics industry means big things for us including the need to expand our physical building and operations well be able to hire an additional and much needed 100 new employees who will help push our efforts forward this is going to be great
8557076 im pleased to report that technological advances by lombard koeller inc have created a much higher degree of efficieny in operations this means big profits for most las vegas nevada politics related companies and their subsidiaries
8557077 output of las vegas nevada politics related products will nearly double overhead will decrease by 1 3 and employee salaries will increase by 15
8557078 our fingers are crossed that corporate execs will honor all current contracts and not fire anyone
8557079 and if all contracts are solid were willing to negotiate with management at an appropriate time in the future to make sure our interests are being satisfied
8557080 i predict stocks will rocket to 30 increases settle and finally creep their way up to 52 week highs
8557081 im getting calls from las vegas nevada politics industry executives investors and general employees all asking about what is going on and if they can provide information for the news agency of course they want their names mentioned so that a little publicity is given to their particular las vegas nevada politics company but it does save me from hunting these people down and taking interviews
8557082 to keep things fair for all parties were going to begin a general auction for our new products within 30 days anyone who wants in and we know that almost everyone does will have an opportunity to bid on the product first dibs go to the top 3 companies who will enjoy a 90 period free of competition from other las vegas nevada politics entities once this period expires other companies can access our new technology and use it as they see fit
8557083 for the past five years there has been a noticable trade imbalance between the usa and other nations working within the las vegas nevada politics market particularly in operations and human capital the recent advances however will help mend this rift and keep more dollars on shore i expect to see demand for labor increase in the long run with additional long run profits for strong las vegas nevada politics usa companies that move forward

8557108 some insured patients are being asked by hospitals to pay larger portions of their bills upfront and sometimes hospitals will not do the procedures until they get their copayments
8557109 can be withheld depending on a patients ability to pay
8557110 as the economy worsens employers are having a harder time affording insurance for their employees theyre increasing the patient portions and patients benefits actually decrease
8557111 must be geared towards finding suitable drugs and vaccines for diseases like malaria tuberculosis and hiv aids which are the main causes of high mortality and morbidity rates on the continent
8557112 these results showing the beneficial impact of alpharadin in terms of pain palliation are important as improved quality of life alongside increased survival are the two key goals of anti cancer therapy of patients with skeletal metastases
8557113 these results build on the positive phase ii clinical data package that we have already assembled with alpharadin the highlight of which was the significant survival benefits that we have already reported in patients with hrpc based on our clinical trials to date i am very confident that alpharadin has the potential to become an important new therapy for patients with prostate cancer this view has been reinforced by the enthusiastic and positive response we have received from key opinion leaders around the world to our unique approach to treating hrpc
8557114 our primary findings suggested that smoking physical inactivity and obesity are inversely associated with awareness of the psa test these risk behaviors are linked with higher prostate cancer morbidity and mortality
8557115 the results concur with our initial hypothesis that men who adopt unhealthy lifestyles may be less concerned with health and less aware of preventive measures like the psa test
8557116 i am happy that aids related deaths have decreased by over 75 over the last four years in comparison with aids related deaths we had in 2003 to 2004 because of increased free treatment
8557117 this represents a 67 survival rate but we still need to do more because those who did not make it may have died because they started the treatment late or did not have access to proper nutrition
8557118 there has been silence on the domestic side about hiv aids
8557119 still see hiv aids as an epidemic that is affecting people in this country particularly minorities
8557120 at a point where weve had a great deal of experience with hiv aids
8557121 some things that we know work well there are some things we need to modify and change and there are some things we just shouldnt be a part of

8557125 pressure on human rights issues such as the criminalization of homosexuality could help bring those at risk out of the shadows
8557126 without political will and education many will never know how to stop aids effectively
8557127 shift in u s policy would also acknowledge that the fight against hiv is also a fight for basic human equality providing a basis for more realistic outreach

8557139 in 2007 at least 26 states made efforts to expand coverage but as the economy has turned downward so have state efforts
8557140 reminds us that americans are suffering in a struggling economy too many of our neighbors are living in poverty and too many are living without health insurance
8557141 todays news confirms what americas struggling families already know that over the past seven years our economy has moved backwards
8557142 while this decline is a temporary victory for kids we fear next years data will paint a worse picture for americas children than ever before as the effects of a sluggish economy will be coupled with the inability of congress to pass renewal of schip over president bushs two vetoes
8557143 are expensive and when tax revenues fall it is going to be harder to keep them up
8557144 we have a much weaker economy than a year ago much higher inflation very unlikely that this trend will continue into 2008 vitez philadelphia inquirer 8 27
8557145 an opportunity for the private sector and the government to work together
8557146 states such as massachusetts have also played an important role in stemming the rising tide of uninsured and thanks to their health reform law they now have one of the lowest uninsured rates
8557147 but 45 7 million uninsured people are far too many and we need a national solution to this crisis
8557148 were entirely attributable to an increase in the number of people enrolled in medicaid and other public programs
8557149 is clear is that economic growth alone will not cut it for most american families
8557150 means more progressive taxation increasing access to affordable health care investing more in public education
8557151 president bush was too busy cutting taxes on top earners to think about any of these priorities the next president must do much better
8557152 truth be told we already have a government funded health care system we just pretend we dont
8557153 theres this supposed mix of private and public insurance but the fact is the u s government you know we the taxpayers spend nearly a quarter more for government health care programs than say canada a country that is supposed to have government controlled health care
8557154 looks great until you see that whats declining is private insurance coverage and whats increasing is the number of people eligible for government programs such as medicaid
8557155 its time to organize government health care into a single payer system one that covers all u s residents
8557156 a closer inspection of the numbers shows some dark clouds around the silver lining
8557157 while total enrollment in private insurance remained stable due to population growth it eroded slightly in percentage terms continuing a downward trend
8557158 growth in coverage was mostly concentrated in public programs partially due to an aging population shifting to medicare but especially in medicaid
8557159 each year a significant portion of the uninsured qualifies for government assistance but hasnt signed up
8557160 in other words the latest batch of data shows again that the policy problem of the uninsured isnt as large as election year opportunism would have it
8557161 the genuine hardships that the fragmented health care system metes out to many families
8557162 insurance is more expensive than it needs to be thanks to regulation and other market interference

8557194 ive just agreed to write a movie for sony and producer scott rudin about how facebook was invented
8557195 i figured a good first step in my preparation would be finding out what facebook is so ive started this page
8557196 i understand there are a few other people using facebook pages under my name which i find more flattering than creepy but this is me i dont know how i can prove that but feel free to test me
8557197 i figured a good first step in my preparation would be finding out what facebook is so ive started this page
8557198 i honestly dont know how im going to write the movie yet
8557199 i feel about this introduction the way i felt about sophies choice it could have been funnier
8557200 most of our patients who come in as trauma patients have been exposed to either a blast injury from an ied improvised explosive device or some other explosive event or a penetrating trauma from gunshot wounds or shrapnel or rpgs rocket propelled grenades or things like that
8557201 so we see amputations of arms and legs we see penetrating trauma to the belly or the chest and because we are also the neurosurgical capability for all of rc regional command south we see a lot of head trauma here as well and that again is also blunt trauma blast trauma as well as penetrating trauma from gunshot wounds
8557202 for the month of july for all of the reporting facilities we had the highest number of casualties coming in to our facility
8557203 there are increased numbers of afghan national army and afghan national police casualties which would from my perspective be attributable to their increased role in operations
8557204 i have a hard time saying there is any success or anything positive related to casualties but i would say its attributable to the fact that they the afghans are doing their job better they are going places they never would have gone before and taking a lead role that they would not have taken before
8557205 if our hospital is full we have to transfer patients out
8557206 a lot of what ive achieved in golf stems from watching people like seve langer and faldo in action at the ryder cup by the second match they were so helpful i really felt part of the team nick asked if he could be my partner and i cant tell you what a boost it was to have the worlds best player player say that i felt he was telling me im around theres no need to worry
8557207 this is probably the highlight of my ryder cup career on saturday night sam told me he had a plan and when i knew what it was torrance put him out first to lead the european fightback i replied you b d i never slept at all that night sam placed a lot of responsibility on my shoulders and i cant tell you how proud i was it was certainly the best i have played in the ryder cup
8557208 ive always said that one of the 24 guys in the ryder is going to hole the winning putt and on this occasion lady fortune played her part and it was me who was given the opportunity and i took it that singles win over david toms below in fact that whole week rejuvenated me and my career and i went on to win the order of merit the following year its funny how things work out but that in turn helped me qualify for this team
8557209 im thrilled to be back playing again missing out on the ulster final was a major disappointment but thats all in the past and n ow i can focus on playing in croke park
8557210 they gave us two very difficult matches in the ulster minor league and getting through those really set us up for a good run in the ulster championship since then they have gone on to capture the leinster championship and im sure they will fancy their chances
8557211 when we played mayo in the qualifiers i felt that somehow or other the game passed me by and i was much happier with my second half form against dublin but winning that match has to be put into perspective weve won nothing yet and were not even in an all ireland final
8557212 there are a few injuries steed malbranque has a problem david healy got a blow at the end but you expect a physical challenge well assess the situation tomorrow
8557213 we lost kieran richardson in training yesterday he was not fit to train and steed djibril and healy have picked up injuries you need a big squad we are two weeks into the season and we are being tested already
8557214 football is a team game and i want all my outfield players to score goals
8557215 the defenders will come up for set pieces and i hope they can get on the end of a good cross and hurt the opposition
8557216 the midfielders are also capable of scoring and while we want davids phenomenal form to continue it is important that we do well as a team and i will be preaching the need for us to score goals from all over the park
8557217 hopefully the other lads can take the pressure off david and if they can do that our goals tally should look a lot better
8557218 when the little man is representing his country he is on fire and nine times out of 10 he will put the ball in the net but hell be happy if others score too
8557219 otherwise what shall they do who are baptised for the dead if the dead rise not again at all why are they then baptised for them
8557220 there i told you it would be the mormons but would you listen now its eternal hellfire for the two of us i hope youre satisfied
8557221 chris hoy is now scotlands most successful ever olympian and everyone in edinburgh is immensely proud of him
8557222 watching him power to victory three times in beijing was truly inspirational and the citys open top bus parade gives as many people as possible the chance to join in the celebrations
8557223 im sure that edinburgh will give all of the winning medallists a fantastic welcome home
8557224 very few athletes achieve the honour of being selected to represent their country as an olympian and i am sure that all of scotland will join me in congratulating the very successful team gb its 32 scottish members and our four scots medallists

8557226 recent activity levels in the housing market have been very subdued
8557227 house builders in particular have been reporting significant reductions in site visits and reservations of new properties since this time last year in spite of a big increase in the use of sales incentives
8557228 is a little more optimistic and suggests that there may be some glimmers of interest returning to the market
8557229 there is clearly less mortgage borrowing taking place in the current market but those borrowers choosing a new loan are tending to opt for fixed rate loans even though they have been more expensive than trackers
8557230 i felt a little bit nervous at the start which is only natural i suppose but thats a great start to the season for me
8557231 andrews a great player so it was nice just to get over the line
8557232 id also like to stay in the top four and get closer to the number one spot you have to set your goals even higher now that youre in the top four
8557233 ive not really put my cue down over the summer i had a week in egypt with my girlfriend but i played a tournament in china and have also been involved with john higgins world series of snooker so ive been busy ive not really had time to rest
8557234 down beat us in the first round in newry after a replay
8557235 wexford then beat them comfortably before knocking armagh out at the quarter final stage so its hard to argue with that level of performance
8557236 now on the back of our display against dublin does that change everything
8557237 things dont simply alter on the basis of a single result things are more likely to alter over a period of time and were in no position to make judgements as to where we and wexford stand right now
8557238 the one thing you can be definite about is that were both in an all ireland semi final even if we took different routes to get there were both there on merit and barring a draw one of us will be in the final on merit
8557239 we would like to think we can but every day is different and no two matches are the same theres a great desire within this side to do well and as long as that hunger remain well be hard to beat
8557240 we became aware the day after the rally that phillip morrows co driver gordon noble was not registered and therefore they were ineligible to score points
8557241 it was an oversight and when we realised the situation we tried to get gordon registered but apparently it didnt happen in time
8557242 what is his agenda nobody has any idea of what is his agenda
8557243 hopefully im past the stage of justifying my ryder cup potential
8557244 everybody and im sure i speak for the ryder cup captain as well understands my love for the ryder cup its how ill be remembered if you like so there is no resignation on my behalf at all
8557245 to get selected i think ive got to show some form of course
8557246 and i feel much more confident having practised here last week
8557247 no id consider getting my game ready to make sure i make it in 2010
8557248 bernhard langer did that when he was left out in 1999 he told me at the time that he was determined to make sure he was on the next team and that would be my goal
8557249 i would help the european cause in any way shape or form i can potentially i would say yes
8557250 he seems to have had a hotline to nick faldo for a while according what im reading in the press
8557251 for nick its almost a shame that europes been so successful
8557252 hes got a hard job while the american captain has nothing to lose
8557253 he was the only one whose emotions i had to deal with he only came to two of the five team meetings so that was disappointing then he had to be teased out of the 18th green to support his team mates
8557254 if anyone has any views especially my commitment to a team event it seems very strange to go to the press very strange to go in public i dont think thats the right way to do anything
8557255 thats what we are aiming at we are waiting for confirmation from sinn fein and we will have to see whether that materialises
8557256 the recent petulant behaviour of sinn fein raises serious questions about community confidence does gerry adams or his friend from the irish republic the partys dail leader caoimhgh n caol in who said ministers could be pulled from the executive seriously believe that threats to destabilise the transaction of executive business will assist in boosting confidence in the unionist community it is entirely counter productive
8557257 the dup has said that we are willing to engage with all parties on a range of issues but we are not in the business of delivering on a republican agenda
8557258 the ministerial code details the legally binding obligations which all members of the executive have to abide by sinn fein need to realise that by engaging in what boils down to childish tantrums they are actually eroding the same confidence which is necessary for the devolution of policing and justice powers
8557259 sinn fein along with the dup committed to entering a process of intensive dialogue aimed at resolving outstanding issues including the transfer of power on policing and justice in downing street in early june
8557260 this process has not materialised satisfactorily partly because the dup leader was absent on holidays for much of this period martin mcguinness was available throughout the summer to engage in this important work
8557261 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8557262 i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by the convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party
8557263 what i am opposed to is a war based not on reason but on passion not on principle but on politics
8557264 it was great to see all the irish lads box so well they gave everything
8557265 paddy was exceptional i thought he boxed very well paddy is very strong but also physically very intelligent he knows when to attack and he also seems to know how to adjust in the ring
8557266 obviously what he does next is up to him but if decides to turn professional i think he would make a great little pro
8557267 its almost like two different sports now because there is a huge difference between the two styles
8557268 the guys are taught to box a certain way in order to score on the computer but that style hasn to change if you want to be successful as a professional
8557269 i think the computer scoring has to change in fact i would like it to back to the old days when you had five judges scoring rather than hitting the buttons
8557270 its never going to be perfect but i think that would be much better

8557274 green taxes are set far higher than is necessary to pay for our carbon footprint which loads an unfair burden on to hard pressed british families and businesses
8557275 its dishonest and unjust for politicians to wrap revenue raising tax hikes in a green banner
8557276 the taxpayers alliance figures are seriously flawed because they are based on a discredited approach to calculating the cost of climate change and in fact green taxes have fallen as a proportion of overall taxes since labour came to power
8557277 green taxes are one of the key policies needed to prevent dangerous climate change that would cost the uk billions of pounds and ruin lives

8557280 they came up to the women and said we want you to leave the hotel
8557281 i called the guy over and said what did you say
8557282 then they escorted us out of the hotel and followed us down the block
8557283 we achieved these results despite a trading environment that is becoming tougher with signs of slowing demand particularly in spain the us and uk consequently our revenue outlook for the second half of 2008 is less certain we anticipate a lower rate of growth for the second half and are therefore taking some early steps to tighten our cost base in a number of markets

8557287 in a society when we very rarely let our mobile phones out of our sight its quite amazing to think that for a lot of us the minute we jump in the shower someone might be checking up on us
8557288 with so many modes of communication available these days its difficult to keep track of your partners whereabouts or who theyre chatting to and when
8557289 flirting is age old but the fact that it can now be tracked on your phone makes a nervous partner a paranoid text checker
8557290 if you suspect that your partner is up to something talk about it text checking can turn into a vicious cycle and it can easily be avoided

8557414 prevention program that doesnt acknowledge that fact will have faltered before it begins
8557415 there has been silence on the domestic side about hiv aids
8557416 still see hiv aids as an epidemic that is affecting people in this country particularly minorities
8557417 at a point where weve had a great deal of experience with hiv aids
8557418 some things that we know work well there are some things we need to modify and change and there are some things we just shouldnt be a part of
8557419 strong protocols in how we implement care and treatment for those who are impacted by hiv aids
8557420 previously addiction to benzodiazepines has been explained by reference to negative rather than positive reinforcement in other words the thinking has been that the reason people continue to use the medicine is that it helps to alleviate their distressing withdrawal symptoms and general discomfort rather than because it provides a sense of reward
8557421 the mean brain volume in preterm infants with abnormal blood flow distribution was 45 millilitres smaller than in other preterm infants
8557422 we examined tissue samples from preterm placentas and classified them according to the amount of inflammation found in microscopic examinations inflammatory reactions were seen in 45 per cent of the placentas
8557423 a genotype causing strong inflammatory response increases the risk of placental inflammation but on the other hand protects the child against inflammation our preliminary findings suggest that genetic regulation of interleukin 6 is also associated with the volume of the deep gray matter of the brain
8557424 dilation of the pancreatic duct widening of the main duct coursing through the pancreas
8557425 often patients with these radiologic findings are referred for eus in lieu of waiting for repeated imaging our study looked to determine the performance characteristics of eus and or eus with fna in diagnosing a pancreatic tumor in this patient population

8557427 patients who used statins before an ami and continued to take them after were 16 less likely to die over the next year than those who never used them so even if it appears that the statins failed to prevent your ami it is beneficial to continue taking them and potentially quite harmful to stop
8557428 in the general population the statin discontinuation rate within the first year of prescription is 30 percent thats very high
8557429 because statins are preventative drugs patients may not feel the immediate benefit of taking them and sometimes stop however it looks like this might be quite a dangerous practice after an ami
8557430 our primary findings suggested that smoking physical inactivity and obesity are inversely associated with awareness of the psa test these risk behaviors are linked with higher prostate cancer morbidity and mortality
8557431 the results concur with our initial hypothesis that men who adopt unhealthy lifestyles may be less concerned with health and less aware of preventive measures like the psa test
8557432 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
8557433 this suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents which berries provide may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes
8557434 freeze drying the berries concentrates these elements about ten times giving us a power pack of chemoprevention agents that can influence the different signaling pathways that are deregulated in cancer
8557435 these changes in gene expression correlated with changes in the tissue that included greater cell proliferation marked inflammation and increased apoptosis
8557436 because both berries and the second agent maintain near normal levels of expression of these 53 genes we believe their early deregulation may be especially important in the development of esophageal cancer

8557453 god made humanity to know him and to rule over his good creation but humanity rejected god and ever since we have lived in rebellion against him and in conflict with each other god chose abraham and his family to be the beginning of a new humanity he rescued this people from slavery and made a covenant through which they could relate to him and display his glory to the world when the persistently rejected god he promised a remnant who would continue the promise of a people who know god he promised a new covenant with forgiveness for sin and with his law written on their hearts ultimately jesus was that new humanity and he rose as the first among many who would enjoy new life in a new creation god is now gathering his people through the mission of the church and will present them drawn from all nations as the perfected bride of his son

8557469 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8557470 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8557471 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8557472 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8557473 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8557507 the difference between writing a book and being on television is the difference between conceiving a child and having a baby made in a test tube
8557508 if everyone began to take small steps towards healthy lifestyle changes including a balanced diet and regular exercise americans health and well being would not only improve but so would the fiscal health of our nation

8557515 the beatles have an insufficient artistic level and cannot add to the spiritual and cultural life of the youth in israel
8557516 shaped the minds of a generation to come to israel and perform before the young generation in israel who admired you and continues to admire you
8557517 i had just gotten my first lp record for my bar mitzvah from my two best friends and it was by the beatles
8557518 and then they canceled the concert we still had no television and only official radio stations we were living in a cultural ghetto the country was bolshevik teenagers and their parents debated it for weeks every teenager was furious
8557519 i can assure you that my father had never heard of the beatles
8557520 the promoter of course didnt come to the government and say i dont like this other guy and i dont want him to get the money he said it is a lousy group and will corrupt the spirit of the wonderful brilliant pure israeli youngsters he exploited their ignorance
8557521 turn on the tv and what do i see a pageantry of empty gestures all lined up for me
8557522 thats a reference to our current president who i very publicly despise
8557523 designed to bring about economic and social reforms and restructuring in russia
8557524 in the selection of these measures priority must be given to those which least disturb the functioning of the agreement
8557525 i am excited by the support from those who share my vision for strong national security greater tax relief a sensible farm policy and a growing economy
8557526 i believe a strong local grass roots effort is key to success in kansas and our folks are top notch
8557527 certainly the twilight zone x files night stalker those were shows that i loved

8557529 the guy is way up there in the top 1 percent in intelligence
8557530 you have this man who has this native intelligence but hasnt really ever chosen to do anything other than get by with it
8557531 but they freaked out when i had to do some of the driving we drive on the other side of the street in australia and jackson is a little bit scared as im looking over the wrong shoulder
8557532 so this one was recast from the pilot literally there have been conversations about making up the cow in case anybody realizes it has slightly different spots
8557533 the west is provoking a new cold war with russia
8557534 to me this looks like burning a very important bridge
8557535 the image of medvedev as a liberal has been terminally devalued in the eyes of europe he has become a figure rousing provocation rather than sympathy
8557536 we do not want a new cold war no one has ever gained from it
8557537 this is a good time to invest with company valuations and debt multiples back to more sensible levels realisations however will be harder to achieve
8557538 has refused to cooperate with the government and recall the products

8557546 when you are a big band and everyone is taking shots at you the more things you can do together the better
8557547 we asked for a study because we wanted to document that if a chain hotel came here it would be lucrative
8557548 and if we get further into the gas leases the current hotel rooms will get gobbled up
8557549 tourism is becoming more and more of a source of economic activity in our region

8557555 it was important for patients to take extra care until they were properly healed so that is one area to look at as part of the investigations

8557561 wir wehren uns immer dann wenn eine gezielte verwechslung mit unserem produkt angestrebt wird
8557562 die angst des marktf hrers vor unserem produkt k nnen wir gar nicht verstehen
8557563 w hrend bionade f r kult und lifestyle steht sehen wir uns eher gesundheitsorientiert
8557564 i dont know if he was born into it or picked it up along the way but hes equal parts drill sergeant and cheerleader
8557565 when you talk about the games business how do i make money it comes down to three things the game the prize and it has to be set up fairly
8557566 this is the job i wanted the day i got here in 1976
8557567 if i had stayed here all of those years i wouldnt be sitting here now
8557568 what we shouldnt do is create a climate that makes it harder to attract new investment
8557569 we need 100bn plus in the next 10 years so weve got to create the right framework that encourages investment we must not lose sight of that
8557570 these are commercial initiatives that farmers will choose or choose not to support
8557571 theres been more consultation in the last two minutes since you stood up there than there has been in the past 18 months
8557572 i appreciate there are differences of opinion about how it should work
8557573 to unify growers and consolidate the clip they should have an ownership stake in the business beyond the farm gate
8557574 thats the only way well get farmers to actually invest in brands into the market
8557575 he is the most complete coach i have ever had on the field and off it you immediately see the difference with other coaches
8557576 it allows us to spread out and its so beautiful up there
8557577 entertainment is side by side the same group that got the party going last year
8557578 we invite anyone who is interested in joining aarp to join us
8557579 i dont think the league will only be about real madrid if we play to our level it will be difficult for them to better us
8557580 aek has now agreed to release rivaldo from his contract following the payment of a transfer fee
8557581 aek would like to thank him for his contribution last season and wish him well in his future career
8557582 it was a difficult decision to make but i have received an offer that is very good for my career
8557583 i dont think any athlete will ever be over the pain of experiencing going in as favourite and then coming away empty handed
8557584 but each day is getting better and you just want to get recovered now
8557585 i didnt go into the race believing i was going to get silver or bronze or any other position in that race
8557586 i went into the race to get a gold medal and i was going to do anything in my capabilities to get a gold medal the race isnt over until you cross the finish line so i dont regret anything that i did i just wanted to win the gold
8557587 my facebook account my myspace and my emails have been flooded with some really nice comments and i couldnt be more grateful for all the general publics support
8557588 its really helping me pull through this time this moment it really is helping me
8557589 its fantastic ive never been a part of something quite so big and so spectacular its amazing how people were really getting behind all the athletes its just a fantastic part of my life and ill always remember it
8557590 im going to carry on until 2012 and hopefully after that as well my result there is not going to affect my future as an athlete
8557591 president chavez has asked that i continue to work with the city and its new mayors to use the experience of london to actually give form to his dream that this can be a first world city in a first world country
8557592 i am proud and honoured to be in a position to be able to offer my advice to those candidates as they start the task of transforming this city for the benefit of all its people
8557593 we have some cricket coming up in the near future so its important that we finish on a high note
8557594 we played some really good cricket throughout the test and one day series and it will be disappointing if we just give up on the next game
8557595 we had our opportunities in the series but our overall performance with the bat has been disappointing
8557596 the youngsters need the confidence to go out there and express themselves and thats something we need to work on because they are the future of sri lankan cricket
8557597 the bowlers however have been outstanding especially thilan thushara and nuwan kulasekera
8557598 thushara seems a ideal replacement for chaminda vaas when he retires
8557599 we would never claim that what we study in mice directly relates to how antidepressants work in humans but there are interesting features in parallel
8557600 the study unifies different observations that point to the brains dentate gyrus region and to creation of nerve cells as being important in depression
8557601 at least in mice this result directly links antidepressants and voluntary exercise with trkb mediated creation of nerve cells
8557602 we can get biochemical physiological behavioral and anatomical results in animal models
8557603 these all resonate with the human condition so perhaps you have a physiological relevancy
8557604 there could be a way to stimulate growth of nerve cells to fight depression for example
8557605 i cannot say i have fully recovered but i can already play every three days
8557606 the most complete coach i have ever had both on and off the pitch
8557607 he cares for all details and you can tell the difference
8557608 we located three separate patches of marijuana plants and were able to cut down about 4 000 plants
8557609 the troopers of my detachment and deputies with the mcdowell county sheriffs department went to the places and cut down the plants they were mature plants about 12 foot tall
8557610 one was in the iaeger area another was near raysal and the other one was in the big creek area
8557611 i clocked it twice from my house to the school in two different vehicles
8557612 its nine miles right now its running me 36 miles a day in a months time that runs into a lot of money no matter how high everything is its not right
8557613 of course people stood up and told the school board this stuff in march and they didnt listen the whole thing is a complete disaster they were promised transportation they have been given a choice in schools and that part is true but there is absolutely nothing being done to accommodate these kids in transportation
8557614 all they have to do is take a few minutes and open their ears and open their minds to find some solutions ive called the school board office to speak with the director of operations on this matter and at this point in time he hasnt returned my calls
8557615 i told him i would get back to him within a week
8557616 im working with him to see if at all possible we could do it where it wouldnt necessitate adding another bus or driver
8557617 pocahontas is the graham attendance area so the buses that run in there bring students to the graham schools but if you are at abbs valley and looking at abbs valley school to the right is the tazewell area and to the left is the graham schools
8557618 i dont understand why the line when youve got seven out of 10 kids going to tazewell instead of bluefield schools why is the line all the way in abbs valley and not somewhere in pocahontas
8557619 the vast majority of the citizens in bluefield va are on a limited or fixed income
8557620 we now have citizens who have to choose between food and medicine this is going to create an additional hardship upon them
8557621 that is why we are reaching out and asking the citizens to voice their opinion by the way of signing the petition and voice their opposition to the rate hikes
8557622 i feel they should in all honesty be given some amount but not that amount
8557623 we had been following him closely even before he moved to bayern munich
8557624 he is a flexible player on the left side and we expect him to liven up our game down the flanks
8557625 i see this as a big chance for me and i am sure i can further develop my game at hamburg
8557626 suspected islamist militants detonated a remote controlled explosive device when the prison van was crossing a bridge over the kurram river killing six policemen and a passerby
8557627 we have the bodies of seven blast victims in the mortuary
8557628 militants from the tribal areas are now increasingly taking vengeance on security forces
8557629 zenit st petersburg will fancy themselves to do really well in the champions league this season
8557630 they beat some top teams in the uefa cup last season so they are no mugs
8557631 there is also a lot of money in the russian game
8557632 a lot of teams struggle when they go out to russia so that gives them a big advantage as well
8557633 i have got a big season ahead with united and england and i want to be fit
8557634 hopefully ill be back soon and fit for the remainder of the season
8557635 i have felt it on and off for 16 months
8557636 the staff and i have worked very hard so that im fit and when i play i dont miss out they have done a really good job i think we have got it under control

8557642 why is it that the only people in the mediterranean without access to their own waters are the palestinians
8557643 the challenge as i see it is that the new generation of coal miners are going to have a greater amount of responsibility at a younger age
8557644 the safety and health of the people who work for the new generation of coal mining engineers are going to depend on them its up to this generation our generation to pass on the passion for safety to the next generation of coal miners
8557645 we learned a lot from our vendors speakers and panelists during the last symposium and from the feedback ive had i think the changes we made were well received
8557646 when i first told my dad that i was planning to enter the wvu mining engineering program ha asked do they still mine coal
8557647 a lot of prospective mining engineering students dont realize that they can pay their way through school by participating in a program like consol offers and working through the summer
8557648 the word is starting to get out about our program
8557649 my dad let me make up my own mine as to whether or not i wanted to go into coal mining but my family has supported my decision patterson worked two summers in consols college program and one summer in a similar program that peabody coal operates
8557650 some people put a negative light on the whole industry
8557651 were aware that our generation has a responsibility for the future of the industry
8557652 the u s supply is maxed out and we dont have surpluses that we can use to take advantage of the greater global demand
8557653 presents such a wonderful opportunity for a young person to start out in a profession and make a career out of working in their home states
8557654 all of the key coal industry officials that i asked to participate said yes
8557655 the people here are very interested in safety i think we are well on our way to zero harm but we are not there yet and we have to continue working on it

8557658 these upbeat capital goods numbers amid a downtrodden u s consumer sector indicates how helpful a weak dollar is in the current cycle
8557659 the recent downturn in growth abroad and stabilization of the dollar could put pressure on capital goods spending in the months ahead
8557660 exports are holding up a lot better than we thought they would with the weakness in europe and japan and we are seeing the impact of the stimulus package on business investment decisions
8557661 we dont want all out war with russia theres no question of launching an all out war against russia
8557662 the question though for russia is whether it wants to suffer the isolation the loss of respect and the loss of trust that comes from that
8557663 there are obviously issues associated with troy buswell they are issues for him and the party and they are issues for the community to make judgements on
8557664 ill have a look at it and see what its like
8557665 it is dirty politics i have seen some dirty tactics in the labor campaigning but nothing like this
8557666 could open a broad new front in efforts by environmental groups to pressure the energy industry into reducing emissions of the greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming
8557667 this really takes it another step by making it a settlement agreement that should have an impact across the industry
8557668 cuomo subpoenaed xcel and four other companies last september seeking to determine whether their efforts to build new coal fired power plants posed risks not disclosed to investors like future lawsuits or higher costs to comply with possible regulations restricting carbon emissions
8557669 this landmark agreement sets a new industrywide precedent that will force companies to disclose the true financial risks that climate change poses to their investors
8557670 coal fired power plants can significantly contribute to global warming and investors have the right to know all the associated risks

8557675 ik heb even gevoeld en die huid voelt een beetje looi achtig aan wel een mooi beest ik was hier gewoon een ochtendwandeling aan het maken zo vind je nog eens wat
8557676 ik heb ook vast fotos genomen om aan de collegas te laten zien
8557677 we are clearly dealing with people who have no regard for human life
8557678 toch is het vervelend want iedereen bekijkt me dan met een beschuldigende blik
8557679 vier jaar geleden was de batterij leeg en heb ik een andere pacemaker gekregen
8557680 ik heb er nooit problemen mee gehad tot twee maanden geleden
8557681 ik wist echt niet wat er gebeurde en schaamde me enorm gelukkig hadden de winkelbedienden snel door dat ik onschuldig was zelf had ik toen niet door dat dit pas het begin van de ellende betekende
8557682 uiteraard ga je dan zoeken naar een verklaring en kwam ik al snel uit bij mijn pacemaker mijn cardioloog verzekerde me echter dat die de oorzaak niet kon zijn
8557683 gaan winkelen is nooit de favoriete bezigheid van frans geweest
8557684 de laatste tijd gaat hij echter graag mee alleen maar om te zien welk alarm er dan zal afgaan

8557687 the court finds that the ordinance as written is too ambiguous to be enforceable
8557688 we feel this ordinance regulates quality of life issues which are of ultimate importance to residents in our unincorporated areas
8557689 our intent was not to put any catering trucks out of business but to ensure fairness to our residents those who live in homes right in front of or across the street from where trucks do business everyday all hours of the day or night
8557690 if you cant manage your restaurant business in a way so that you can compete with a taco truck maybe you should find another business
8557691 this law hurt us it favors some businesses over others and makes a hardworking person into a delinquent

8557709 i had forgotten all about it the fact its been 50 years
8557710 if i werent the author id know what the answer would be

8557942 its right to talk about an international crisis theres no question of launching an all out war against russia
8557943 we are in a situation which marks a clear end to the relative and growing calm in and around europe since the collapse of the soviet union
8557944 the last 15 or so years have seen a period in which europes borders have been clearly demarcated new nations have come out of the old soviet union theyve joined the european union
8557945 and the european countries have enjoyed a period of unprecedented stability i think that the danger that arises from russian actions is that that period comes to an end
8557946 we the foreign ministers of canada france germany italy japan the united states and the united kingdom condemn the action of our fellow g8 member
8557947 i wouldnt agree that we really have a threat of a new cold war russia was is and will continue to be the last country in the world that would want a repeat of the cold war
8557948 the most important thing was to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe
8557949 what we shouldnt do is create a climate that makes it harder to attract new investment
8557950 we need 100bn plus in the next 10 years so weve got to create the right framework that encourages investment we must not lose sight of that
8557951 the position on tax is a matter for the chancellor and the treasury the treasury receives a whole range of representations and of course will consider such representations in the normal way
8557952 a legalised raid on the companys bank accounts that would be very unhelpful because it would scare off investors and also could make the cost of investment much higher and in the end that would end up on the customers bills
8557953 the era of cheap energy is over the question is how we are going to adjust to that and what sort of help can we provide to those who are going to struggle the most

8557963 thushara seems a ideal replacement for chaminda vaas when he retires
8557964 its just that we havent been consistent with our batting
8557965 whether its putting on runs first up or chasing down a target we need to bat well

8557967 our members no longer need to sift through the multitude of hotels within a destination just to find a suitable option in convenient location at the right price with desirable amenities
8557968 business travelers often find their schedules changing on the fly meetings get postponed or extended itineraries change and they need to book hotel rooms and revise their schedules quickly often without immediate access to a computer thanks to worldmate and hotels com what was once stressful finding a nearby hotel with the right amenities and doing it in mid trip has now been simplified to a few clicks on a mobile phone
8557969 i have personal experience at that when i made my remarks about the rutgers basketball team which was mean spirited and directed at people who did not deserve to be made fun of and was not funny i apologized for that i didnt offer any lame excuses but he refused to place into context either my life or any of the work that i had done in my life

8558175 the royal navy does not tolerate misuse of drugs by its personnel and internal action is under way against all 18 individuals
8558176 notwithstanding the numbers involved in this single unprecedented incident which is being treated very seriously it has not affected the ships ability to do its job
8558177 positive test rates in the navy last year averaged less than 0 4 compared with over 7 in civilian workplaces

8558181 the implementation of state parks agreement to continue enforcing the interim vehicle limits at the oceano dunes state vehicular recreation area at all times including the holiday periods of memorial day independence day labor day and thanksgiving
8558182 anyone whos seen the dunes on a holiday weekend in the last four years should want to know if state parks is holding the line on vehicle caps
8558183 we need to see evidence of compliance with their permit
8558184 this was the outcome we anticipated we kind of hoped for
8558185 we dont want things to start happening and wish we had done this before
8558186 kids dont have any business being out there after 10 oclock
8558187 we think the owners are responsible for what is done in their stores
8558188 the proposed ordinance is unwanted by the business community unnecessary for law enforcement and unwise in this economic time
8558189 this is nothing more than extortion on some businesses to raise money for a county entity to pay overtime and for stings that are justified in their estimation
8558190 more than enough money to fund enforcement without going out after the business community
8558191 i think its fair to say we should not be pumping more from blacklake wells than blacklake is using

8558194 our next president will have a mandate to build an enduring global peace on the foundations of freedom security opportunity prosperity and hope
8558195 with eyes firmly fixed on our future and in the spirit of unity lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8558196 having this office means we will be a one stop shop
8558197 we can now be looked to by clients for storage they can come pick up boxes its gotten our business to be more prompt and more legitimate

8558203 again it is another opportunity i think every opportunity is important
8558204 i dont know if i could sit here and say one game is more important than another or one game is more important than some good practices or some good practices are more important than a game
8558205 it is certainly part of the picture i dont know if i could put a weight on it or say it is more or less than something else if you are running a race with a guy and he is a lap ahead of you and you have a strong finish you are still going to finish behind him if you are neck and neck with the guy and you have a strong finish then you beat him it makes a lot of difference so it would depend on what the relationship of the competition is at this point for how much the last game means
8558206 its up to you whether you get cut or not
8558207 its up to you going out there and performing and earning the respect of your peers and coaches so at that point it kind of is what it is its kind of all up to you and how you perform
8558208 no no no because weve played them the last few years in the preseason
8558209 but you know what if the question is whether it will ever be the same it wont because this is preseason i think for it to be that way its got to be a regular season game but then you know what it might have to be that big game again for it to have some significance to it
8558210 im worried about the redskins on sept 4 thats who were worried about beating the patriots does nothing for us unless we see them in february
8558211 not necessarily i think a lot of it is established in practice and i guess most of the time especially in preseason we get more carries in practice than we do in the actual game
8558212 again i think it puts the onus a little more individually to go out and execute with a limited amount of game reps
8558213 they have worked hard they have probably been as good a working group as we have had
8558214 they have worked hard off the field in the classroom learning their assignments watching film spending extra time with the coaches learning how to work the avid video equipment doing some of their own cut ups and stuff like that theyve worked hard on the field
8558215 they make mistakes just like all rookies do and we will see how they perform over the long haul not just based on a couple of weeks but they have put a lot into it they have been accountable we havent had any problems with them in terms of discipline things or being late they are there early they are eager they are ready to go and they have consistently tried to do their best and learn from their mistakes
8558216 when you first show up its kind of just you and the rest of the other veteran guys and theyre already established you want to join their ranks and establish yourself you got to use people to help you get there so why not use your teammates that are in the same boat as you to get there
8558217 we do it a lot because you kind of have to coming to this team and the type of expectations that you have this is obviously a very complex system so you dont really have much of a choice but to do that
8558218 we kind of have expectations for each other we always hold each other accountable with me and jonathan well sit there and study a little bit and ill ask him some questions and hell ask me some questions whatever it may be even on the field well ask each other what the call is and you can hear us talking about the call on the field thats what we normally do out there
8558219 weve definitely built a camaraderie among this group were all trying to make the team and were all starting from square one

8558237 we have some very deserving college students who are paying their way through college everybody in the business is chipping in to help these deserving kids get a little extra for college
8558238 we emphasize the importance of education to our employees and we had decided that each year we wanted to donate all proceeds for a day to a worthy local cause
8558239 so marie suggested we create a scholarship fund with all the days proceeds going to support our hard working college bound employees
8558240 it means a lot because not every business owner would do this
8558241 steinberger doesnt treat us like employees he treats us like family
8558242 i used to play soccer and this is where we would come to celebrate
8558243 my mom wanted me to work here because its close and its an ice cream shop
8558244 we came for free ice cream but since its a special day well just buy some
8558245 it was just on my calendar to come over here today and buy ice cream
8558246 i really think its nice i think its a great idea anything that help our kids to go college
8558247 i would vote for him again if he would run again and a lot of union friends feel the same way
8558248 is one of those guys who is just larger than life
8558249 we can critically evaluate how were taking care of the soldiers and vigorously try to improve the quality of the care on the battlefield
8558250 we are seeing a much more significantly injured patient population than on the civilian side
8558251 ive been deployed four times over there and the way we did medical care each time was different
8558252 this is the largest investment in teacher incentives in the entire country and texas likes to be no 1
8558253 we cant put a financial value on education but we can reward teachers who break away from the pack and who are working to do the best
8558254 in our negotiations the agency finally said to us that we could use other funding sources but initially when the grant money became available it said we had to use local matching funds
8558255 northside as a bigger district brought to teas attention the fact that it wasnt well publicized
8558256 they tea should have at least informed the other districts but theyre not going to be aggressive when theyre handing out their own money
8558257 i think there are some people across the state thinking again about their decision not to apply for the grant
8558258 the number of applicants is not a failure when you consider there were so many roadblocks and lots of misinformation
8558259 it became obvious that in july he actually under read the meters
8558260 by doing so he triggered off the following months read as being much higher the guessing for the july bill made the august bill reflect almost the total usage of water for july and august
8558261 were notifying the affected homeowners by phone over the next couple of days recognizing there was a mistake and giving them the actual amount due this month
8558262 it was a hot day in july he probably took the easy way out and stayed in the air conditioned truck
8558263 anybody can have an employee who doesnt do his job
8558264 the thing is to find out about it and apparently we did we actually were on top of this before people got their bills
8558265 i understand the role that texas women have played particularly barbara jordan and ann richards
8558266 for me now 15 years later to fulfill a role that each of them has played is like a gift i am humbled and excited
8558267 certainly it raises her influence within the democratic party in texas
8558268 it means she is one of the most influential latina political leaders in the country
8558269 kennedy came along and i was excited by his attitudes
8558270 but i was too young to vote you needed to be 21 at the time
8558271 along comes barack obama and i had this feeling like i was 18 again
8558272 i never thought in my lifetime a black man or any person of color would be able to stand and accept the nomination for president
8558273 and the fact that im going to be there in person
8558274 i dont see myself as a black american and thats not how i see barack obama
8558275 american culture sees him as a black man but hes a biracial man
8558276 obama didnt come from a typical background he has a broader vision
8558277 if we were roommates in college we wouldve worked out because we have similar ways of viewing the world
8558278 to me it wasnt nearly as much a black thing as it was finally an american thing
8558279 they wouldnt let him in until he was 18 so he went to join the day after he turned 18
8558280 they marched him down commerce street to sunset station and put him on a train he wasnt able to communicate with his parents that hed joined
8558281 he went to a wrestling match with a friend from the phone company somebody in the ring made him really mad and he decided to jump in and show that guy the what for
8558282 the promoter decided he was a character and they invited him back to be a wrestler
8558283 he was shorter than most people and he was skinny but growing up with older brothers he learned early to never let anyone mess with him
8558284 he could rip a big phonebook in half he could cut nails with scissors
8558285 brown fixed phone lines and took part in wrestling circuit
8558286 every lawsuit that was a result of a firing has gone through the tml lawyers
8558287 they do their negotiating and then come to the board with their recommendation tml basically pays a portion of that and bexarmet pays a portion its not always 50 50
8558288 resulted in widespread and pervasive negative publicity against bexarmet has severely damaged bexarmets standing and good will in the community has reflected adversely on bexarmet and its board members has been seriously prejudicial to bexarmet and in and of itself warrants issuance of notice of the boards intent to discharge olivares
8558289 cost of firings at bexarmet had a role in olivares ouster
8558290 so citizens are made aware of the corruption in the mexican army and the president
8558291 these banners announce gangs presence its kind of a macho strutting it is a sign that not the public authorities not the government but that the gangs are in some sense in control of the street
8558292 this is what the march was all about one of the things for equality and here we are 45 years later and you got an african american as a primary candidate for nomination of a major political party
8558293 were just marveled at the things that we have seen that have come to pass in our lifetime as far as eliminating segregation seeing the integration of schools and the achievements that blacks have made over the period and i think the march was the catalyst for all of this
8558294 i would say that this upcoming speech will signify progress on the part of our nation but what it does not signify is that everything that martin luther king hoped for has come to pass
8558295 in other words i think it represents significant progress but im concerned that if for instance sen obama is actually elected that people will say weve arrived all the strivings and racism are over now
8558296 i think thats not the case with the nomination and i dont think itll be the case if he is elected
8558297 its a society now that some people say has become more tolerant but that isnt a good word
8558298 youre not supposed to tolerate me youre supposed to look upon me as an equal and this is pretty hard to do this is going to take my generation the next generation and now it is becoming a realization with the baby boomers

8558305 on a prospective basis only beginning with admissions for the 2009 fall semester
8558306 even a freshman has made conscious decisions about courses theyre going to take and how it impacts their grade point average
8558307 im hopeful that the higher education coordinating board will wait for a brand new cohort to implement this
8558308 based on my interpretation it says yes go forth and make this happen in 2009
8558309 we conclude that the coordinating board is required to implement its standard method on a prospective basis only and has the latitude to provide for a transition period
8558310 based on our initial reading of the attorney generals opinion it is our understanding that the uniform grade point average calculation does not appear to apply to currently enrolled high school students
8558311 were very supportive of a uniform system for class ranking
8558312 we feel like it will allow students across the state to be compared fairly
8558313 led by a team of internet advertising veterans and engineers brightroll has served billions of advertisements since we got started
8558314 support services continues to be a major driver of growthand the middle east is still booming
8558315 following the strategic acquisition of alfred mcalpine infebruary we are the largest support services company in the uk
8558316 we expect good double digit growth in earnings next yearand the 17 percent increase in our interim dividend to 4 1 penceunderlines our confidence in the future
8558317 despite a slower macro outlook in uk construction which weestimate accounts for only 10 percent of earnings carillioncontinues to guide to materially enhanced earnings in 2009 driven by continued growth in the middle east and the extractionof mcalpine synergies
8558318 sales volumes of vehicles in indonesia in 2008 areestimated to rise quite drastically to 575 000 600 000 units the previous record of car sales was 533 900 units in2005
8558319 that estimation is based on the fact that vehicle sales inthe january july period have already reached 353 501 units
8558320 in view of the subdued economic outlook operating ebit earnings before interest and taxes is estimated to come inslightly lower year on year
8558321 net income is expected to rise significantly given theelimination of certain special items and lower tax expenseversus the previous year
8558322 we have no dorm last year yes this year no

8558328 i remember playing in the final and as i said in my programme notes before the game i want those days back
8558329 i want to be playing in finals winning trophies and medals again no matter what competition it is in the last time i won anything was the play off final but bolton should be a team that is getting to the latter stages of these competitions
8558330 we let ourselves down against northampton and that is the whole squad not just the team out on the pitch
8558331 no disrespect to them they were up for the game and ill take nothing away from their achievement but it is a game we should have won
8558332 maybe it is a wake up call for us and it means we have to put all our efforts into the next couple of months
8558333 maybe come december i might be saying it was a blessing in disguise that we went out of the carling cup if we are fighting for a european spot
8558334 it was a massive chance for us to do something outside the premier league and maybe get into europe through this route
8558335 but it wasnt to be and now all our attention is on the league because that is all we have got until the end of december when the fa cup comes into play
8558336 it is up to us now to make sure we stay up with the big boys we need to keep up in the top eight and have a good look at ourselves
8558337 the last two games we have had mark bunn and shay given get man of the match
8558338 you could say it is a testament to us but we are losing games and we cant let bad luck get to us we have to start putting the ball in the back of the net its as simple as that
8558339 there is nothing pushing us to do a deal urgently
8558340 the company reported for a thirteenth consecutive quarter arise in sales and profit due to the effective reduction ofcosts

8558345 yet again we are hearing the worrying news that there has been another attack on fire fighters
8558346 this is very concerning that the fire service is being prevented from doing their job by those that are attacking them
8558347 the fact that they were trying to get to a fire that was started deliberately at an elderly womens house makes it extremely troubling

8558408 everybodys excited about this game because its bluefield graham even though we played last week
8558409 its a big game the biggest crowd the most excitement
8558410 i moved here in third grade and ive come to every game since
8558411 i think its important to everyone because of course we always want to beat beaver its probably the most important game
8558412 i think ive been to all of them since i can remember
8558413 id go with my parents and i just remember it being so exciting
8558414 we work so much harder because this is the first time that people can see us at games
8558415 i think it really means a lot to the boys and to us and to the community that this game is played because its what everybody knows around here its the beaver graham game
8558416 my first beaver graham game was when i was six or seven
8558417 my dad used to always go to them and one day he took us to it and it was really exciting and fun to watch
8558418 one of my friends was like come to beaver graham with me
8558419 i didnt really know how big it was until i went
8558420 i like to make fun of her because she was a band geek at graham
8558421 bluefields homecoming was at the same time as graham i told her that ours was so much better and she went to the wrong one
8558422 my father went to bluefield and he was a cheerleader here too so i want to follow what he did
8558423 but my father actually graduated from bluefield but he has been a football coach teaching here for a long time
8558424 we go over all the cheers to make sure that absolutely everyone knows them
8558425 we try to get everyone pumped up try to get everyone excited and then we just try to get everyone spirited
8558426 weve been practicing almost every day so we can get our cheers down and dances lined so we can do them really good at the game
8558427 get the football players excited and make sure they go and play their hardest when they get out there
8558428 i think we can cheer em on to the best of our ability and let them know that were here to support them and hopefully well go out and win
8558429 we make sure that a couple weeks before the game that were ready to get out there and we know exactly what to do and how excited we need to be for it and just make sure everyones ready because it is a big deal
8558430 weve practiced every day to get our dances and our routines down
8558431 weve been to two camps and weve just been practicing a lot
8558432 as soon as the last game ended i just started thinking about the next season
8558433 i need it and i really didnt even play in spring ball and i didnt like that either i want to play
8558434 weve got a pretty tough schedule but were all human
8558435 we all came from the same place but im just ready to get out there and play
8558436 i think on every play everybody is going 110 percent and looking real good
8558437 i treat every day like its live pads or no pads
8558438 it does feel kind of weird because i am so used to them being there
8558439 im so used to being the younger guy and now im playing that mentor big brother role
8558440 it is kind of weird but at the same time i like it but i miss those guys
8558441 we lost two great guys last year but i think were going to be really decent on the defensive line a lot better than people thought
8558442 our linebackers are great and if we can hold up the blocks and get them through the holes theyre going to do it
8558443 first and foremost i want to commend mike joseph because it looks real good out there
8558444 everybody is in shape theyre running faster to the ball everybody is looking real good
8558445 the athletic part is there weve just got to run the playbook
8558446 it feels real different but it feels different in terms of being in shape
8558447 its been like that all summer its making us feel like this in camp i think if he had been here last summer we probably would have felt the same way things are a little different better i like it im enjoying it
8558448 the defense is always going to be faster than the offense learning in any level because the offense is way more complex than the defense
8558449 the offensive guys out there are learning and its a little different theyre doing a lot of motion and crazy stuff like that but were not really preparing for them as a team
8558450 these were the first guys that recruited me and my brother and after i committed to west virginia a lot of other schools started focusing on me
8558451 i didnt pay them any attention because this place felt all right for me and it worked out perfect for me no complaints at all
8558452 i dont care how we win how pretty how dirty just win thats it from august to january
8558453 this is the best it has been for a couple of seasons its a real honor to win this award but the greatest feeling is to be 1 0 after our first game
8558454 im proud of matt for all his hard work during the off season and in summer practice
8558455 he has gone all out to make himself better and to help our team hes managed to pick up a step too
8558456 on the kick return for a touchdown for instance a couple of george wythe players had an angle on him but matt somehow got up into another gear and kept going
8558457 but when we got that big run back and score right back it really helped us that was important
8558458 when you have colton cook corey beavers and brandon pauley in the passing scheme and cody lockhart throwing the ball behind our offensive line i know im going to be open some those guys are making a difference
8558459 he works hard and helps the younger players improve he is always doing something positive especially with the underclassmen to make us better players he is a good man to have on our side
8558460 some players might not go all out since they already have a scholarship or maybe back off to avoid injury but matt plays 100 percent all the time a coach cant ask for more than that
8558461 i think i have and our team has 13 more games this season to keep improving that is what this year is about for tazewell no matter what week it is
8558462 theyre just a fine offensive team and defensively theyre very aggressive and have great intensity and effort
8558463 really the key to this football game is will concord match the intensity and effort of carson newman
8558464 its so that you force your football team to learn the proper game tempo and game speed at which to play at a championship level and i think that carries through from this football game throughout the season
8558465 the thing ive found about our players is they rise to the level of competition that they have the more you challenge them the more you get out of them and our young men i think are up to the challenge
8558466 weve maintained our focus mentally i think our coaching staff has done the best job yet of preparing each of the different position groups theyve taken responsibility and held themselves accountable for that preparation
8558467 he really in a way directs the rest of the receivers and is a stabilizing force

8558473 ive been to games where it seemed like someone got leg cramps on every play but ive never had a team with so many
8558474 we give them gatorade and water we run sprints we didnt have cramps in two scrimmages and we played both of them in the heat of the day
8558475 i looked up some stuff on the subject and it also depends on who could have a vitamin deficiency
8558476 it includes magnesium chloride levels salt intake its a combination of things

8558479 im really excited this is my senior year my last beaver graham game so i cant wait
8558480 probably some of the team doesnt even know where were ranked
8558481 we dont really pay attention to that we just go out and play hard and practice hard and just try to get better every day
8558482 theyre young and its their first year playing so theyre really pushing each other to try and get better i think theyll work real hard
8558483 weve got a lot of good skill and young line that is coming together every day in practice they are getting better and they really want to learn to try and get better im real excited about them
8558484 i had played defense in middle school and my ninth grade year and i really hadnt played it since then
8558485 coach fred simon thought i could play some safety and i believed in myself that i could and he gave me a chance and im just trying to make the most of it
8558486 it means a lot because i went to school with some of those guys over there and played with them
8558487 it means a lot to me and im real excited for friday this is my last year and i cant wait

8558500 it didnt come easy i didnt just walk in and they put me in the starting lineup
8558501 its exciting its been a long run especially for me and brett
8558502 weve paid our dues and it is our time to shine were going to go out there and compete every week and i think well be just fine
8558503 were going to keep the same mood were going to pick up where we left off last fall and just keep going and just keep getting better
8558504 we just play each game the best we can i think with our coaching staff and coach frank beamer were going to always have a shot
8558505 im very excited for me personally i am very excited because this is my last season
8558506 my last season playing for this defense and playing for coach beamer and playing in this great stadium im just excited to get it going
8558507 im just going out here giving it my all every day in practice
8558508 im trying to get through this camp get ready for the preseason and well take it from there if youre going to slack off here youre going to be at another school
8558509 you have to work hard all the time you just go out and play the best you can
8558510 it was an experience it was fun i enjoyed every moment of it
8558511 just being out there you have fun as a backup but actually being out there as a starter and have your name called out on the video board before the game it was just exciting
8558512 we will be fine here we all push each other freshmen push the seniors and the seniors push the freshmen
8558513 were here as brothers and we just push each other so its not all going to be on the shoulders of the seniors were just going to push each other
8558514 i think well be fine especially with coach foster being an outstanding coach
8558515 a lot of people dont know what to expect just because we had 10 or 11 seniors but there is always a guy to come in and replace you
8558516 im just being consistent at this level you have to be consistent week in and week out especially if you want to win
8558517 anybody can go out there and put on a uniform but if you actually want to perform and win games you have to be consistent
8558518 you never know in the acc a couple of years ago it was wake forest
8558519 you never know who will have a surprising year the acc is so competitive it could be anybody and hopefully were in there but you never know who it will be
8558520 its been fun its just like were playing out in the backyard again but instead were playing in front of 60 000 people so its fun
8558521 we have some laughs and some memories to talk about once we leave here
8558522 im not trying to get too much into that but if we just go out here and take care of business and play ball and be aggressive and be dedicated to what we have to do i dont see no reason why we shouldnt

8558541 recent estimates indicate that if trends continue the way they are developing countries will face a 75 increase in the number of cervical cancer cases because of growth and aging of the population in the next two decades but it doesnt have to turn out that way
8558542 the discovery of hpv as the cause of cervical cancer has shaken a field that was stagnating and we are now in a new era where developing countries no longer have to be left behind
8558543 efforts are needed now to adapt the current price of the vaccines so they meet what individual countries can afford the solution may be tiered pricing according to gross national income per capita and according to the scale of country efforts

8558580 obviously lag will be a huge problem for online play were working on it its quite difficult for 3d street fighter at the moment
8558581 in order to prevent the lag were thinking about trying to balance it up at the user interface level and input timing we still havent got a complete plan as yet were still working on it thats all we can say at the moment
8558582 there is too much at stake we cant be hanging on
8558583 id stress that its going to be difficult but if we get through this round the next game will probably be the most important game in the history of pats
8558584 i think the profile of the club definitely gets a lift and its great for everyone me the players the people that work at the club and the fans especially its great for everyone

8558598 i think it is extremely unfortunate that they moved forward without making a strong statement about dui laws
8558599 it doesnt make sense to move forward without that tie
8558600 if they lowered it arbitrarily it wouldnt necessarily be effective in reducing high risk drinking
8558601 there would have to be a lot of work on the front end to get it down
8558602 were trying to get people to support the general idea of debate
8558603 its an issue that most americans have seen as settled over the past 25 years
8558604 an informed and dispassionate public debate over the effects of the 21 year old drinking age
8558605 misguided initiative that uses deliberately misleading information to confuse the public on the effectiveness of the 21 law
8558606 that many of our educational leaders would support an initiative without doing their homework on the underlying research and science
8558607 but the current answer is also not an effective solution to the problem
8558608 i support this initiative because it will allow our colleges to engage in real education of our students about responsible use of alcohol as well as model moderate behavior
8558609 treating college students as adults will help them to make more responsible decisions
8558610 weve seen some very dramatic changes over the past four years
8558611 as an institution of higher education our first responsibility is to educate students
8558612 its not calling for a lower drinking age not calling for an 18 year old drinking age
8558613 and i dont think those adjectives are at play right now
8558614 the decision about cme is really part of a series of policy decisions on the broad topic of conflict of interest that have been ongoing since 2004 2005
8558615 we began with our decision to ban gifts from industry in 2006 this was followed by other revisions in our conflict of interest policies for clinical practice
8558616 there were lots of concerns appearing at the same time congress and various other groups had expressed concern
8558617 we thought it would be reasonable for stanford to have a committee and evaluate the story for industry support for cme at stanford and then to serve that up to the dean with our options
8558618 the decision to develop the new policies is in response to the options developed by the cme task force
8558619 so this has really been a continuing and evolving assessment about industry relations and not a response to some new or precipitous event
8558620 i do not think that the quality of cme will be harmed
8558621 but i do believe that the integrity of our educational programs and their freedom from any bias will be better achieved with these new policies
8558622 current cme is traditionally lecture based whats the newest and greatest as opposed to how do we improve the health of this group of patients
8558623 i think rob jackler associate dean for cme has plans that we will shift content irrespective of funding to better education of improving outcomes and quality and less emphasis on medical facts
8558624 many of the clinical chairs were very concerned about that losing funding and i imagine they remain concerned
8558625 most people would say that its a likelihood that funding would go down
8558626 i was just wondering when someone gets injured say falls from a tree or god forbid gets shot or stabbed what happens to them
8558627 if i found a man shot on my doorstep i would give him some water and some bread
8558628 but what about his life is the hospital called does anyone take him to the hospital
8558629 oh no no no no calling the hospital will bring the police here they will beat us and arrest us
8558630 but if there is no hospital care does anyone do anything do they survive
8558631 i was conscious to say that i am opposed to many of the current governments policies
8558632 i sometimes felt that i was actively distancing myself from my identity as an american
8558633 another volunteer and i wanted to start a dental health project
8558634 we asked at the clinic if they had ideas of where we could get informational material they told us that they actually already have lots of materials for dental health as well as rabies maternal health and other projects all the materials were just sitting there because there was no one to use them
8558635 she was the only nurse on duty for a hospital condemned with gunshot wounds stabs drugs and alcohol
8558636 it is one of the most ambitious projects ive ever done independently and even if it is not fully successful i know that i am at least making some benefit and that i will learn a lot through the process
8558637 its so easy to get comfortable at stanford and caught up in your life there
8558638 theres the potential to learn a lot from time in a medical setting abroad theres also the potential to contribute a lot but if you want to do either of these you will have to be very proactive
8558639 any time the organization makes money its just a huge sigh of relief
8558640 the tanzania visit was just supposed to be a one time project but during my semester at sea i met people and talked to them and started thinking about what was larger than just myself
8558641 the seeds started to germinate in terms of what i was passionate about
8558642 we got a group of 25 students to return the next summer and in 2004 we hit the ground
8558643 in the first few years a lot of my family thought oh shes just doing her thing
8558644 but then they realized i guess this is kind of serious
8558645 i just loved all the extra resources more than everything else
8558646 going back to school makes you realize how much is at your fingertips stanford makes it really easy not every student gets that from their college
8558647 school forces you to question your place in the world
8558648 it makes you really skeptical of how much you can do and how youre going to do it it can feel frustrating and just inhibiting but ultimately the professors and general academic environment and international development pushed forge to be as solid as it could be
8558649 even as a 25 year old she works all the time you dont find that in many people especially if they dont make that much money she also stopped out of college and finished her degree while working full time hers was just such a unique situation
8558650 no he querido hacer una faena a un colega a un club como el villarreal pagando una cl usula de rescisi n no es nuestro estilo faltaban seis o siete d as para terminar el plazo de fichajes no hemos querido depositar esa cl usula

8558658 what is clear is that b triples have been operating in victoria on victorian roads now for 13 years without incident
8558659 following that successful trial what were encouraging governments to do is to have a network identified for the use of b triples which are higher productivity and safer vehicles
8558660 we did a joint assessment report in june we only found a very few isolated communities which have not received any support at all so we immediately supplied them with aid but that doesnt answer the more important question who may have got aid at some point in the past and needs more aid now
8558661 what you see is that many people are having problems getting back to normal life again we get a lot of people complaining of headaches and insomnia almost no people with physical injuries are turning up now thats totally different after an earthquake when theres a steady trickle of injured people reporting to medical treatment stations for quite some time afterwards thats different with a cyclone you either survived or youre dead in this case thereve been no outbreaks of cholera or other epidemics either
8558662 if the un organisations worked together they would have known which villages have not received any food yet they might need more cooperation from one agency to another

8558670 there is going to be no let up in hunting down those who have to face the consequence of the law but the forces on the ground will definitely exercise great sensitivity to the observance of ramadan the government will not allow those who are object of this manhunt to hide behind ramadan to escape liability before the law

8558701 the solution may be tiered pricing according to gross national income per capita and according to the scale of country efforts
8558702 we dont have a system here the government does not have a solution
8558703 if we did not have foreigners here i dont think the afghan national army or police would come out of their bases
8558704 if just 20 or 30 police had come round from the side they could have stopped them
8558705 its a very tough situation for people like me who helped the government
8558706 i receive calls and they ask are you still alive
8558707 the government also warned him the taliban insurgents were plotting his assassination and yet he maintained that they are not powerful
8558708 i dont think so it is the government that is weak
8558709 but when we see this kind of attack it seems they are very powerful
8558710 i would suggest it wasnt as strong as it could have been

8558718 australia is not immune to sexual slavery it hasnt stopped the sad tragedy of this is we are still acting for women this situation is going on on a daily basis in australia its behind closed doors and run by very well organised international crime syndicates
8558719 its got to do with education and a lack of staffing and a lack of resources
8558720 we know if residents have more one on one attention we wouldnt need as many sedatives
8558721 its better to manage them through reducing the use of tea and coffee and giving hot milky drinks rather than giving sleeping tablets
8558722 its important to try other strategies rather than move straight on to medications that help people sleep and sedate them
8558723 its a slow process but one we have to do properly to ensure safety
8558724 were not out of he woods yet the trucks will remain on the road
8558725 i think they wanted to set an example with us and show the lacrosse world that yeah theyre the weaker links so we should slaughter them
8558726 but unfortunately for them they took us lightly and we shocked them two goals we could have had it
8558727 im proud of the way they have reacted throughout this tournament to all the naysayers
8558728 im happy but at the same time we dont want our guys to get complacent they know they can play better still and hopefully they can do that against the shamrocks
8558729 scoring a goal in a tournament like this is huge for anybody
8558730 putting a couple more just put the icing on the cake my first goal it was a long time coming it was neat to get that one
8558731 when i drove up to my street it was nice house nice house nice house
8558732 the house was a rat hole grass a foot long racoons out back digging around the garbage it was just brutal

8558734 it was pure training no outside distractions just boxing and sleeping kind of like when i first turned pro in 2000 when i was living in the gym

8558736 my message to steve has been fight your fight dont do any stupid mistakes
8558737 what you really get worried about on the inflation side is when you have these kinds of increases in food and energy prices feed into higher wage demands
8558738 higher wage inflation kicks off a wage and price spiral the data were seeing suggests that just isnt happening
8558739 youve got western canadas oil and gas sector still pushing along and the oil and gas numbers are significantly higher than were seeing in manufacturing
8558740 in manufacturing if anything theyre going to be looking for ways to minimize wage costs
8558741 2352 by masturbation is to be understood the deliberate stimulation of the genital organs in order to derive sexual pleasure
8558742 both the magisterium of the church in the course of a constant tradition and the moral sense of the faithful have been in no doubt and have firmly maintained that masturbation is an intrinsically and gravely disordered action
8558743 the deliberate use of the sexual faculty for whatever reason outside of marriage is essentially contrary to its purpose
8558744 the sexual relationship which is demanded by the moral order and in which the total meaning of mutual self giving and human procreation in the context of true love is achieved
8558745 ich halte es mit klaus kinski man muss nicht die leute umbringen um b se zu sein
8558746 while we are capable of meeting current demand there is a backlog of high priority patients
8558747 in that context the decision to outsource to an australian hospital with the capacity to perform that surgery within the next three months makes sense
8558748 we want to take every opportunity to put a face on stanford so that the students we really want have a harder time saying no to us
8558749 and we also want to make sure that the students we are saying yes to are really the right students for stanford
8558750 i have gone to numerous send off parties for newly admitted stanford undergraduates and i often hear students trying to decide between stanford and other universities saying that they have had more personal contact with other universities that offered interviews
8558751 also for students from the east coast who may have concerns about the move an alumni interviewer can answer questions about the west coast and assuage the fears of students and their parents
8558752 the alumni can be a goodwill ambassador of sorts for the university
8558753 alumni interviews are just one part of our oval outreach volunteer alumni link efforts
8558754 we recognize alumni as a great largely untapped resource for our office especially in places far from california where we often dont have as many local resources as our peers
8558755 alumni will be able to play an important role in corroborating the other information we have in the admissions file as well as bringing to light information that might not otherwise be apparent in a written application
8558756 but every final admission decision rests with the admission committee
8558757 the small size of the pilot allows us to implement a rigorous systematic evaluation of each interview report
8558758 in the spring of 2009 we will analyze the hard data and also survey the participants in the interview process
8558759 wed like alumni to approach their meetings with applicants as less of a formal interview and more of a conversation a back and forth exchange in which the alumna us shares his her experience of stanford and in turn discovers what is outstanding about the applicant
8558760 in money laundering operations in which proceeds were transferred through the united states of america into canada and vietnam
8558761 there are businesses that were seen whether or not they were used at this particular time for money laundering purposes remains to be determined
8558762 we are closing gateways used by criminals for their illegal activities through the dedicated persistent and sometimes dangerous activities of our law enforcement officials who should be applauded for their efforts
8558763 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side
8558764 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8558765 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8558766 we would not have marriage equality in california if it werent for del and phyllis they fought and triumphed in many battles
8558767 through it all their love and commitment to each other was an inspiration to all who knew them
8558768 i think in these matters its best to proceed with all due care and deliberation and of course people are always innocent until proven guilty
8558769 on information currently to hand there are serious questions whether donations intended for one purpose may have been put to a different purpose
8558770 if they had the courtesy to talk to me this matter would have been cleared up in a few minutes
8558771 we dont intend to decrease our fare prices when the atf prices drop in september we will wait for the atf prices to stabilise before we think of passing the benefit to customers
8558772 there is a possible drop in atf prices by 10 12 per cent which could translate to about rs 300 400 in fares but we will not immediately cut our fares
8558773 our basic fare structure will remain consistent in the next 45 days between september to october we are neither increasing our fares inspite of the fact that festive season is coming up
8558774 the cybermission is important and it will go forward for the air force
8558775 the issue is in what context form and national framework this is not just about the air force it has to fit with the strategic command and the broader national security community and were going to make sure all those pieces fit together as we proceed
8558776 the military is thinking more about the non kinetic effects of warfare
8558777 it makes sense to have the guys delivering most of the precision ordnance from the air to have control over both the kinetic and the non kinetic aspects of the operation
8558778 traditionally the air force has carried out strategic bombing strategic cyberwarfare could be seen as an extension of that mission
8558779 fifty years later they are still squabbling over which is the lead service in space
8558780 the national security agency may have tapped into a foreign command and control system while the air force simultaneously has plans to take it out
8558781 i would love to say there should be an information warfare czar to coordinate these types of activities but we often find there is not good coordination even at the higher levels
8558782 to sit the responsible managers down together to coordinate activities jointly
8558783 there should be a simple easily implementable kernel to the lisp that

8559008 you dont get anything when you come to these places it was scandalous typical of referees a ridiculous decision
8559009 we played very well im delighted with the players but they didnt deserve the ref spoiling the game for them people might think it is sour grapes but we didnt get a decision all night and izak reid is now distraught
8559010 we are ever confident that it will get done but we have always said it will go to the wire
8559011 we will keep moving it on and we hope that he will be joining us here at chelsea there were two players luiz felipe scolari identified one was deco and one was robinho and we have already seen the impact deco has made on the premier league i think the squad is strong and capable of competing in all competitions without robinho but with him it is an added dimension
8559012 he doesnt want to join either of them and we are now discussing the next move to see what we do
8559013 were obviously keen to bring him to the club if we can
8559014 if the opportunity presents itself well try to pursue it but were not further down the road as yet the situation before we flew was the same it may have moved forward or it may have gone backwards but until i put the call in i wont know
8559015 were very hopeful if it doesnt happen it wont be for want of trying
8559016 we needed to strengthen our defence and anton is a great signing hell bring quality and competition for places which is what we want hopefully we can take him to another level here at sunderland he has come through the ranks at west ham and maybe just needs a change

8559033 he has improved his first touch and his link up play which was vital for his progression
8559034 he can be decisive in any game against anybody if the team has a good collective display and you can get him involved
8559035 for a while he has worked on a lot of things and without losing that one on one ability he has looked to have improved and found that right balance between individual play and the team play i have always said we have to be patient with him what he did today was the brand of a goal finisher and you cannot teach that he has that naturally
8559036 it was a big game for us and i felt we were well organised disciplined and focused we were never really under threat
8559037 it was important not to make mistakes we were patient and scored our goals the response was clear togetherness focus and efficiency
8559038 we want to play with the best and to do that we had to qualify for the group stage it was a big mental test the whole team was sharper and physically much better than on saturday and that is why it made it easier they man marked all over the pitch and did not take many risks when they had the ball they were more focused on possession we had to be well organised as they played a little bit with our patience
8559039 he brings calm and confidence to the side and overall we had a good balance today in the side cesc could have stayed on he always wants to play but he was probably more disappointed that they did not have a go at us i took him off as we play again on saturday and recovery time will be short

8559223 the extent of influence may not be equal for all aspects of society and culture although the fact that there is an influence at all suggests that psychosis is only fully understandable in light of the wider social context
8559224 we dont want all out war with russia theres no question of launching an all out war against russia
8559225 the question though for russia is whether it wants to suffer the isolation the loss of respect and the loss of trust that comes from that
8559226 even if the military is firmly in charge of pakistans nuclear programme where is the civilian component in decision making
8559227 ultimately there will have to be evidence of a strong civilian oversight for the world to accept that we are moving in to a new and more reassuring phase maybe after president musharraf politicians gain enough clout in time that they become full partners in managing and securing the nuclear programme
8559228 there is no indication that the military does not exercise full control over pakistans nuclear assets

8559232 xjtag is an absolute necessity for any company that is designing complex circuits that feature high pin count bga or chip scale devices xjtag is easy to use and incredibly fast which has enabled us to shave weeks off the development schedule for our rfeye module thereby leaving our development team free to develop rather than sitting around painstakingly debugging boards
8559233 xjtags appeal is also its versatility it is designed to be used right throughout the product lifecycle from design and development through to the factory floor and beyond
8559234 xjtag can also test both jtag and non jtag devices which means that test coverage is very high we can get to over 80 of devices on the rfeye boards via the jtag chain whats more xjtag provides the ability to re use and port test scripts between circuit boards which saves us loads of time

8559243 while it takes upward of 50 000 to invest with a commodities trader you can still participate by investing in commodity related exchange traded funds etfs or stocks that invest in commodities such as energy and mining also consider mutual funds that invest in a mix of stocks and commodities
8559244 i have never seen so many markets exhibiting such powerful trends
8559245 the difference in todays market may be the influence of energy in particular oil on other commodities which is causing strong inflationary pressures but dont forget
8559246 investing should be done for the long term markets eventually adjust and bull markets fade but a good trader can and should benefit from increasing as well as decreasing price trends
8559247 you can support us or leave to our fate but if they come for us and all hope is gone we will turn the middle east into a radioactive wasteland until the end of time

8559264 cualquier duda acerca de por qu rusia invadi georgia se han disipado
8559265 reconociendo ilegalmente los territorios georgianos de abjazia y osetia del sur dmitry medvedev el presidente ruso dej claro que la meta de mosc es la de redibujar el mapa de europa usando la fuerza
8559266 esta guerra nunca ha sido sobre osetia del sur o georgia
8559267 mosc est usando su invasi n preparada durante a os para reconstruir su imperio conseguir mayor poder en el suministro energ tico de europa y castigar a aquellos que creen que la democracia puede florecer en sus fronteras
8559268 donde occidente actu para prevenir la limpieza tnica la limpieza tnica de georgia est siendo usada por rusia para consolidar su anexi n militar
8559269 el pr ximo paso en el gui n de la invasi n rusa de desinformaci n y anexi n es un cambio de r gimen
8559270 si mosc puede expulsar al gobierno de georgia elegido democr ticamente entonces puede intimidar a otros gobiernos europeos

8559320 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity

8559328 ik vind niet dat het bij de taak van journalisten hoort om dan zelf maar op dievenpad te gaan maar ik vind wel dat ze relevante informatie die de bestuurders geheim willen houden ongeacht de herkomst openbaar moeten maken

8559330 actually it was normal diplomatic dialogue no criticism no protests and it was conveyed in a very constructive way we actually exchanged our opinions on the situation
8559331 what is clear is that b triples have been operating in victoria on victorian roads now for 13 years without incident
8559332 following that successful trial what were encouraging governments to do is to have a network identified for the use of b triples which are higher productivity and safer vehicles
8559333 the vehicle was going to pick up prisoners and as it reached a bridge an explosive laden car exploded and nine of our policemen and two passers by were killed
8559334 the higher oil price doesnt help the transport sector either

8559340 its a package that doesnt require the support of the opposition and doesnt require legislation
8559341 yesterday we had no plan b today we have a plan b
8559342 this was always their plan b a plan b that yesterday he said didnt exist
8559343 i just dont think he can be trusted on any of this and i think thats what the community made up their mind on some time ago
8559344 what we are seeing is morris iemma and michael costa treat the parliament and the people of new south wales with the same contempt with which they have treated their own party
8559345 hes completely misled parliament he misled the people of new south wales
8559346 im not giving a lesson on accountancy but you do write money off over the term of a contract
8559347 what we pay is in an investment during that period you have a player who is doing a job and in this industry you buy and sell players
8559348 you have to look at these things pragmatically sometimes these things dont work as well as you want them to
8559349 remember we got deco for 8million and that looks to be the buy of the season
8559350 australia is not immune to sexual slavery it hasnt stopped the sad tragedy of this is we are still acting for women this situation is going on on a daily basis in australia its behind closed doors and run by very well organised international crime syndicates

8559352 james has a three year contract i do not want to talk about losing him
8559353 he is absolutely top notch around the club around the training ground he is getting better and better every game
8559354 my optimism gets less the nearer we get to the deadline 1st september
8559355 i am really happy to play in a team like milan
8559356 for me this is a dream come true everything has happened really fast in a week
8559357 everything here is incredible the people are very easy going and they have made me feel like im at home
8559358 to have become european champion with the under 17 national team and of course at the age of 18 to have arrived to a big club as arsenal
8559359 in london i have learned a lot it has been a life school and manager arsene wenger has helped me
8559360 today i can say i have reached a superior level by coming to this club i want to give 100 and improve every day
8559361 this team wants to return to the champions league and i will do everything i can to help
8559362 we needed to strengthen our defence and anton is a great signing
8559363 hell bring quality and competition for places which is what we want hopefully we can take him to another level here at sunderland
8559364 he has come through the ranks at west ham and maybe just needs a change
8559365 it was hard leaving west ham because i have been there for 16 years but after meeting roy keane i knew it was time for a change
8559366 this is a great challenge for me and i feel it is an exciting time at sunderland i think the move will do me good
8559367 i have one more player in mind and then that is the end of it for a few months at least
8559368 ena je priznala da ju je njezin dvije godine stariji momak zlostavljao zbog ljubomore i sumnje da ga vara

8559371 with the some of the restrictions associated with the recent beijing olympics now behind us we anticipate continued strong output by chinas steel industry with associated demand for high quality manganese ore
8559372 it would give cricket a global audience and help stimulate our push into markets like china and north america
8559373 you either do something about it or you stick your head in the sand
8559374 weve got to get back to working together dominate around the ruck and not give away too many penalties
8559375 weve got to be a lot more disciplined than we have and stop putting a lot more pressure on ourselves like we have been
8559376 its mainly us forwards we havent been square at the marker or leaving early or grabbing legs in tackles weve just got to be disciplined
8559377 i definitely support it i can understand why theyve done it and i totally support it
8559378 ten years ago there was one korean player on the tour now theres 40 or 45 plus the japanese
8559379 its important to note that this whole policy is directed at international members its not about the korean players
8559380 everyones been talking discrimination and its all about getting korean players off the tour and really its the wrong thing to assume its not about that
8559381 the fact is there are a lot of korean players and a few japanese and some of them not most cant speak enough english
8559382 its important that they are able to communicate with the sponsors with their playing partners and even with rules officials
8559383 its not like theyre just left to do it on their own the lpga are going to provide professional services to allow them to work on it and become better
8559384 if you have a look at the numbers overall they show that the domestic economy remains pretty robust
8559385 its down to the fact that the mining boom is having a significant impact but its not just mining you are seeing it across other areas as well with transportation and construction remaining quite strong
8559386 the important factor is that there are other economies around the world that are noticing a pretty significant slow down but were in a much more enviable position
8559387 it is reassuring for the reserve bank that the death of the australian economy is not at our doors yet
8559388 this sort of gives them some light at the end of the tunnel weve seen weakness in consumer sentiment weve seen weaker business sentiment numbers but really it hasnt translated into a weaker investment number yet
8559389 really the supply side of the economy is pretty well primed to grow quite rapidly and absorb the inflationary pressures so wages will remain in check
8559390 it gives the reserve bank the option of making that rate cut come next week
8559391 i think theyve compounded the problem and i think thats why wayne swan really has been the worst treasurer in australias history
8559392 its just unbelievable that labor could trash business confidence so quickly and comprehensively
8559393 the boks wouldnt be in this position if there was a director of coaching who helped map out a style of play
8559394 the job requires someone whos been at the top of the game and who can offer advice and set out a structured plan for the springboks
8559395 i dont want to be the coach but im concerned about the way the team is playing
8559396 i havent spoken to saru about it but i would be interested to hear what they have to say when they hear im interested
8559397 if ever there was a powder keg about to explode it is the springbok camp where on centre stage is a passionate but misguided coach who doggedly refuses to concede that he has got it wrong
8559398 you have players who are privately seething and on the point of rebellion these guys are fed up with being led on a wild goose chase
8559399 it has been reported that springboks captain victor matfield was given three different game plans by the three coaches in the set up
8559400 the lack of fuss with which this has been accepted shows that de villiers has liberated us from evaluating players on anything other than their playing credentials
8559401 we probably want a few more games before that but thats the way it is
8559402 weve got one game before so well have to go back to our states and work pretty hard and try to do the best we can there to prepare as well as we can for india
8559403 its always hard to prepare for india which has such different conditions than here so it is going to be tough i think we will manage
8559404 playing one day cricket there i know how hard it is
8559405 but to play test cricket with the wickets and playing five day cricket its going to be extremely hard but its a challenge im looking forward to
8559406 theyre a fairly young side and theyre going to go pretty hard
8559407 were going to do the same thing were not going to give them an inch and hopefully its going to be a good series
8559408 recent events in georgia cast the shadow of war and nuclear threat over foreign minister stephen smiths decision on the russian nuclear treaty
8559409 it is clearly not appropriate and should have no place in australias future
8559410 that wasnt the aim of this meeting the agreement has been signed and russia doesnt see any connection between what is going on in the caucasus and co operation in the field of peaceful atomic energy
8559411 we of course are strictly against any worsening of relations between australia and russia
8559412 mr smith stated that australia respects the territorial integrity of georgia and believes that russia should abide by ceasefire arrangements and return to the positions they occupied before the conflict
8559413 mr smith has said that he will be conveying australias protest over the situation in georgia to the russian ambassador in australia
8559414 but the minister must now go one step further and show russia that there are consequences to its actions and its trampling over georgias sovereignty
8559415 australia should move to reposition our representation away from moscow of the nine former soviet states who still receive australian representation via our moscow embassy
8559416 its very pleasing hes obviously had a long stint out of the senior team hes had a frustrating run in the last 12 or 15 months
8559417 were all pretty pleased hes back not least presti himself
8559418 every indigenous people will resist alien settlers as long as they see any hope of ridding themselves of the danger of foreign settlement

8559478 notwithstanding the dire warnings of the cassandras of doom who predicted widespread violence and electoral rigging in order to justify the defeat of the opposition parties nothing of the sort happened
8559479 the massive popular mandate for president mahinda rajapaksas policies was further underscored by the fact that the upfa had won all 27 electorates in the 4 districts of anuradhapura and polonnaruwa in the ncp and kegalle and ratnapura in sabaragamuwa and secured more than 50 of the votes cast in every one of them
8559480 the expectations of violence that were based on the incidence of violence in the last three days of the campaign in particular were fortunately not met cmev also acknowledges the positive impact of the actions of the police in those areas where its presence and commitment was reinforced
8559481 the relatively high voter turnout of around 65 and the general enthusiasm demonstrated by the electorate to cast their votes were positive affirmations of their continuing belief in the value of the democratic system
8559482 we the ltte in hiding were starving in maduru oya sometime back a young sinhala woman carrying an infant brought me food and drink i inquired from her about her husband and she said the ltte killed him her reply made me speechless her husband was killed by the ltte and she was still offering the terrorists food and drink it was then that i decided to give up terrorism
8559483 regardless of what he looks like hes still a child hes not a monster
8559484 they kept telling us he wasnt going to survive but he did he kept fighting and kept getting better and better he had all sorts of infections and he made it through all of it he made it for seven years well almost seven years
8559485 because hes gone we dont have many pictures left of him from before the fire
8559486 every picture that we have is like gold to us
8559487 this picture here shows him eating this is his first meal after the fire the hospital told us he would never be able to eat so these pictures are everything to us
8559488 we were so excited when he started to get better we just went picture crazy these pictures are not offensive theyre very very special
8559489 personally i would like for them to apologize to us first of all
8559490 this deal has furthered the vision we have at aci real estate which is to bring world class luxury living to dubai the ferretti group has been a leading luxury brand for decades now we at aci real estate want to blend ferrettis expertise into our real estate projects and provide our customers with the best of both worlds
8559491 the whole world is coming to dubai and at aci real estate we have found our match this strategic venture is a result of mutual professional admiration and recognition of our common values
8559492 the plan is to consult with court managers to determine in each court what is the best way we can achieve the savings we need while having the least impact on public access to the courts
8559493 the kinds of questions were asking are should all the courts be closed the same half day each week does it make sense to have some courts closed at different times were pretty much into that kind of micro planning at the moment
8559494 its definitely not going to be to anybodys advantage to close it everything will just get backed up i dont think its such a good idea
8559495 the court finds that the ordinance as written is too ambiguous to be enforceable
8559496 we feel this ordinance regulates quality of life issues which are of ultimate importance to residents in our unincorporated areas
8559497 our intent was not to put any catering trucks out of business but to ensure fairness to our residents those who live in homes right in front of or across the street from where trucks do business everyday all hours of the day or night

8559534 the facts are that james transfer request was actually handed in on wednesday august 20 at which point it was asked by newcastle to keep the matter private
8559535 the request was given because the player was looking for an improvement on his contract that reflected his development and his value to the club
8559536 to clarify the situation james did sign a contract 12 months ago however this agreement was reached with the club nearly 12 months previous at the point at which newcastle had agreed to sell james to aston villa on transfer deadline day 2006 before cancelling the agreement at the 11th hour
8559537 since then he has played over 80 games for newcastle all james wanted was a deal that reflected his development and that was in line with newcastles transfer valuation of him
8559538 whilst james does have three years left on his current agreement it is common practice that when a young player signs a long term contract this is reviewed and improved on a regular basis with a players development but equally it protects the clubs position in regard to their transfer value
8559539 although the transfer request was handed in seven days ago james has been professional in keeping the matter private whilst giving strong performances for newcastle
8559540 some people have branded me and hull cheats but thats ridiculous
8559541 if id played for another club in the competition before lining up for hull it would have been a different matter
8559542 i didnt have a clue i was breaking any rules when i played against rochdale and widnes but must admit was worried by all the fuss when it was spotted
8559543 i was panicking for the boys in case we were booted out
8559544 i dont think hull should have been kicked out and i would still feel the same even if it had been another player and club in the same situation
8559545 we didnt deliberately break any rules it was an error and its a shame if this overshadows our big day
8559546 other clubs have committed more cynical offences in recent years and not had to pay such heavy fines
8559547 it was an unacceptable error and we did make a mistake but took our punishment on the chin
8559548 i hung around with the wrong crowd and got arrested a few times for nicking cars and doing stupid stuff like that ive been locked up but never sent down
8559549 tony then dropped me and i missed out on the play offs and the grand final win over st helens

8559609 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

8559632 they level the playing field for all parties and the rules are clear for everybody
8559633 we have an increasingly difficult parliamentary situation because we have increasingly divergent views on a range of issues whether its the economy the environment the criminal justice system the view of our country in the world
8559634 those will obviously all be issues on which the various parties will contrast their positions when we get into an actual election campaign

8559769 it does show just how jittery people have become about the economy and their own job
8559770 these poll findings show just how many people are getting worried about losing their job in the current economic slowdown
8559771 the economy will inevitably slow this year and next given the credit crunch and the impact of higher oil food and commodity prices but there is a real danger that if everyone thinks that the downturn will be deeper than it needs to be it will become a self fulfilling prophecy
8559772 these findings add to the growing pressure on the government and economic policy makers to put growth first by doing all they can to restore confidence and boost investment

8559813 bella arriverei ad odiare me stesso se dovessi farti del male
8559814 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razzionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita scomparsa dietro lorizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi stelle niente aveva pi senso
8559815 torner talmente presto che non avrai il tempo di sentire la mia mancanza prenditi cura del mio cuore te lho lasciato
8559816 una cosa mi era chiara e la sentivo in fondo allo stomaco al centro delle ossa dalla punta dei capelli alla pianta dei piedi e nel mio petto vuoto chi ama ha il potere di distruggere e io ero stata distrutta sbriciolata
8559817 il tempo passa anche quando sembra impossibile anche quando il rintocco di ogni secondo fa male come il sangue che pulsa nelle ferite passa in maniera disuguale tra strani scarti e bonacce prolungate ma passa persino per me

8559821 for sure i received calls from england to ask me about my situation in september
8559822 i just spoke with my agent luis aparicio and saying i did speak with wigan or whatever other club is a lie
8559823 we know weve got ourselves off the hook but we were not guilty of complacency
8559824 its just that we seemed to lose all our rhythm against a team which scored two quick goals and kept coming with their tails up
8559825 the facts are that james transfer request was actually handed in on wednesday august 20 at which point it was asked by newcastle to keep the matter private
8559826 the request was given because the player was looking for an improvement on his contract that reflected his development and his value to the club
8559827 the defeat did highlight that we need a lot more strength in depth and hopefully that will come before september 1

8559961 the toxic combination of bad policies economics and politics is in large measure responsible for the fact that a majority of people in the world do not enjoy the good health that is biologically possible
8559962 there are examples where health inequalities have narrowed but in too many cases we have seen a widening
8559963 but that means the magnitude of inequalities is flexible if the gap can widen it can get narrower

8559965 the key message of our report is that the circumstances in which people are born grow live work and age are the fundamental drivers of health and health inequity

8559968 people need the opportunity the possibility to take control of their lives but the conditions need to be right to allow them to do that
8559969 the uk is at the forefront of tackling health inequalities but the challenge of reducing the gap in life expectancy is still very much an issue
