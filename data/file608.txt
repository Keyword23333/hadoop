6080233 im an innocent man and my book will show you that
6080234 glitter had been warned that he could legally only stay in the country for 12 hours my boss is getting impatient with him now
6080235 but that seems a poor option at the moment as the vietnamese authorities will probably just send him right back
6080236 i dont want any sex offenders in this country but the point is vietnamese officials have deported him to the uk so as we do whenever sex offenders return to this country we need to plan for what happens when people return
6080237 never mind his individual case anybody who is returning to the uk in these sorts of circumstances would be met at the airport by police officers would be served with an order which effectively puts them on to the sex offenders register
6080238 one of the things we have learned generally about sex offenders is they do want to travel to places where they can exploit children
6080239 if there is evidence the person is travelling abroad to abuse children we can get an order that stops them travelling there should be more of those
6080240 in every single case the court has to make the decision but this is the type of case where i find it pretty hard to imagine it is legitimate for him to travel abroad again
6080241 i think its right that we use police time to monitor sex offenders
6080242 if you are a british citizen you have the right to use the nhs whatever we think about an individual and this is a pretty despicable person
6080243 pretty hard to imagine it would be legitimate for him to travel abroad again
6080244 we are now waiting to return him to england as soon as possible

6080257 these three talented skilled and experienced communications executives bring proven track records to their new positions
6080258 they have made important contributions to northrop grumman throughout their careers and i look to them to expand their impact in their new leadership positions
6080259 dave brings to the forefront a unique combination of leadership and communication skills which are required to be successful in the extremely broad and highly competitive market space that our business operates
6080260 he has continuously demonstrated strong performance since the sector was formed in 2006 and his personal commitment to excellence and that of his communications team have been key factors in helping the broader organization achieve our key objectives
6080261 under katies leadership the communications function has been transformed into a valued strategic and tactical business partner helping the operating divisions achieve their key business objectives
6080262 her extensive communications expertise and experience and positive leadership influence will serve the organization well going forward
6080263 dans extensive experience across the full range of communications disciplines will continue to serve us well
6080264 his expertise demonstrated at both the corporate and business unit levels suits him ideally to this new role
6080265 the tennessee blogosphere is pretty mutually supportive for the most part
6080266 and so in that vein ill point out that his moniker is
6080267 friday the 13th is considered a day of bad luck and it seems fitting for albertans to use this day to send a message to premier stelmach that theyre not happy with the secretive pay hike
6080268 the premier seems content to sweep his secretive pay hike under the rug and albertans should let him know loud and clear they arent happy
6080269 we understand albertans are busy so its not feasible for them to drive to edmonton to protest these pay hikes in person
6080270 but with a phone protest it only takes a minute to make a quick phone call to the premiers office
6080271 i think its a golden opportunity to brand alberta and do something innovative and fabulous to be proud of our province
6080272 it has to do with the fact that the wildrose alliance has wild rose in their name and the governing progressive conservatives dont want a free ad on the back of everybodys car
6080273 i think mr stelmach is scared and i think its funny
6080274 it wouldnt be so much a change of licence plate so much as a change in nationality
6080275 because those are words that ring in the american national anthem on american licence plates in the american declaration of independence
6080276 i dont get involved in things like this i dont have time i am an adult if it were my kid i would make time
6080277 sorry about that i was just about to step into bath
6080278 are you sure you want to be telling me that
6080279 hi i am jane morgan i am running in the election and i am a little surprised at the variety of signs on your yard
6080280 nope in fact i called the liberals and told them to remove it they told me it is outside of property line and is on public space
6080281 well it certainly looks like it is in your yard
6080282 i know and everyone thinks is support them who are you running for
6080283 well go for it you are the only one who has come to my door
6080284 well there are several and frankly i dont have time for that

6080289 a few weeks ago when the game featuring aerosmith guitar hero aerosmith came out there was more than a 40 percent increase in their catalog sales i expect youll see that again when metallica gets the same kind of treatment in a few weeks
6080290 when death magnetic comes out in september you can actually download the new album the same day it comes out and play it on your guitar hero iii
6080291 this is a chance for something thats been a competition to actually be an ally if you will
6080292 if youve ever played air guitar more than likely you werent doing it to a michael jackson song you were doing it to an aerosmith song

6080298 i am deeply convinced that one of the best things we have in italy is our cooking
6080299 italy is one of the few places in the world that you move 10 20 miles and you eat something completely different
6080300 we have such an enormous tradition about the food and we have to absolutely preserve it
6080301 eating traditional local foods is an experience that brings satisfaction to the palate but above all is enrichment for the soul
6080302 see her lipstick thats the color you should be wearing your red lipstick reminds me of my mother its too old

6080306 merlot is good and no single variety can be singled out as good or bad
6080307 this is america but it will soon be a world culture people need to go out and try something new
6080308 he is forced to pour his high quality wine into a sea of mediocre merlot and has to find his place in the world again
6080309 but when a fire comes through the forest out of the destruction theres opportunity for new growth

6080363 but the tories said it showed the government had lost touch with reality
6080364 while the british public is having to tighten its belts the government is spending taxpayers money on a completely frivolous project
6080365 this shows how detached the labour party has become from the concerns of the british people
6080366 as we approach this historic finish line i am pleased that decades of hard work unprecedented public and private partnerships and countless hours of consumer education are working

6080370 you can only use amplification when you know what youre trying to get and thats the problem
6080371 when you want to discover something unknown amplification is a very deficient technique because you keep discovering the things you already know so how can you discover the unknown

6080378 group material exhibitions staged in more recent years in cultural institutions such as the whitney museum of american arts and the dia center for the arts bring together the works of diverse artists and display them in relation to each other often deliberately contradictory objects from mass culture in addition to providing a bricolage of visual stumuli each exhibition interrogates the age old distinction between rareified art and real life by asking for whom is culture is really intended and in what ways it might come truly to reflect the diversity of the community
6080379 the clinton and bush foreign policy teams acted on the basis of two false premises
6080380 one was that russia is innately aggressive and that the end of the cold war could not possibly change this so we had to expand our military alliance up to its borders despite all the pious blather about using nato to promote democracy the belief in russias eternal aggressiveness is the only basis on which nato expansion ever made sense especially when you consider that the russians were told they could not join the other premise was that russia would always be too weak to endanger any new nato members so we would never have to commit troops to defend them it would cost us nothing they were wrong on both counts
6080381 on the night of aug 7 saakashvili ordered an artillery barrage against tskhinvali and sent an armored column to occupy the town he apparently hoped that western support would protect georgia from major russian retaliation even though russian peacekeepers were almost certainly killed or wounded in the georgian assault it was a huge miscalculation
6080382 was foolish and possibly criminal but unlike putin he has led his country in a broadly democratic direction curbed corruption and presided over rapid economic growth that has not relied as russias mostly does on high oil and gas prices
6080383 you guys have been at practice every day weve been communicating

6080394 hana is developing a breakthrough design that lets consumers connect the online libraries of hd content to their tvs
6080395 instead of watching online content on their pc or having to run new wires to their tvs the 1394 over coax standard will let consumers easily connect all of their hana enabled services throughout the home using only the coax wire and communicating with the devices through a single remote this solution creates a simple whole home networking solution that anyone can use by enabling 1394 to operate over coax consumers will be able to use the fcc mandated 1394 port on their hd stbs to distribute cable content to other rooms as well assuming their cable provider supports it
6080396 together hana and 1394 will allow consumers to share content anywhere within the household with no configuration necessary setup is as simple as connecting a single cable
6080397 the hana and 1394 over coax standard solves challenges of moving multiple hd video streams while maintaining content security and consumer friendliness

6080404 it was obvious to us that migrating to a tapeless workflow was the way to go since we are talking about the core of our workflow here it was important for us to find a dependable partner to enable us to troubleshoot potential problems quickly and reliably dvs is this partner

6080423 the reason i do the work i do on darfur is because of my experience as an olympian i and any other athlete or person of course but this is an olympics story who chooses to speak out about issues of conscience when people are losing their lives has every right to do so that freedom was said to be implicit in the olympic charter and it appears that the ioc and certainly china has no interest in protecting it and that i find outrageous

6080426 every public school needs effective methods of discipline but beating kids teaches violence and it doesnt stop bad behavior
6080427 corporal punishment discourages learning fails to deter future misbehavior and at times even provokes it
6080428 when you talk to local school officials they point to the fact that its quick and its effective and thats true
6080429 it doesnt take much time to administer corporal punishment and you dont have to hire someone to run a detention or an after school program
6080430 we need forms of discipline that makes children understand why what they did was wrong
6080431 teachers may have overcrowded classrooms and lack resources such as counselors to assist with particularly disruptive students or classroom dynamics
6080432 corporal punishment is not effective at the junior and senior high school levels and i do not recommend its application
6080433 it can be useful for elementary students especially with amateur clowns as opposed to hard core troublemakers for this reason i am opposed to abolishing spanking in elementary schools because we have systematically eliminated the tools with which teachers have traditionally backed up their word were now down to a precious few lets not go any further in that direction
6080434 most parents like this because it takes care of the punishment it gets the kids back in class it doesnt disrupt instruction its like the quick and dirty way of dealing with discipline problems
6080435 it works on some and it doesnt work on others
6080436 if youre one of the individuals that it does work on yes it will become a deterrent
6080437 i dont think its the schools place to make decisions like that
6080438 im not necessarily in favor of that kind of punishment in the house either but i feel like if somebody makes that decision it should be the parent
6080439 these dolls are not toys they are fine collectibles to be enjoyed by adult collectors

6080445 as long as it doesnt hit you over the head
6080446 i think its important to show what kids really use
6080447 t is very important that we ensure the public has a reasonable amount of time to provide input on our proposed changes to school board governance
6080448 because of vacations and summer schedules we decided our deadline may be difficult for some groups and individuals to meet
6080449 i think it is important that all potential school board candidates be fully informed about our proposed changes before they make the decision to run for election

6080459 we were the unlikeliest lot and that is precisely why god has chosen us
6080460 ich glaube dass ich einen ganz guten job gemacht habe so ein erstes match ist nicht gerade einfach noch dazu wenn man eigentlich der favorit ist
6080461 das 4 1 spricht eine deutliche sprache selbst wenn ich nicht gleich meinen rhythmus gefunden habe insgesamt bin ich mit meiner leistung zufrieden allerdings sind auch noch steigerungsm glichkeiten vorhanden
6080462 gegen vladimir samsonov habe ich bei der em letztes jahr in belgrad mit 0 4 verloren das will ich nicht noch einmal ich kann hier befreit aufspielen und will das match m glichst eng gestalten und lange offen halten
6080463 seigneur tu as dit que tu octroyais deux vertus chaque peuple mais les fran ais en ont trois est ce pour cela quils se placent au dessus des autres

6080469 we store them very very carefully in the hopes that someone someday may decide that we can use them again
6080470 youd have to talk to every one of the 10 072 election jurisdictions across the country
6080471 after 2000 everyone thought you could throw a bunch of money at the problem and make it go away right away elections aint that kind of thing
6080472 there has been no evidence of any tampering on these machines
6080473 i think were the only county in the country that has that contract stipulation
6080474 i have a huge inventory of machines that i am not able to use
6080475 who wants to buy a system that has been decertified especially when other states are following suit
6080476 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
6080477 the mccain campaign i think is being pulled in two directions
6080478 on the one hand this race is largely a referendum on obama and whether or not hes going to pass the leadership threshold in the eyes of voters so being aggressive against obama on questions of leadership and trust and risk are important but at the same time i think they need to be very careful because mccain is not at his best when he is being overly partisan and negative
6080479 he suggested in his speeches here and there that i turned my back on comprehensive reform out of political necessity
6080480 there are honest differences between them they want to take the country in different directions and well talk about it
6080481 and the beauty of his words has attracted many people especially among the young to his campaign i applaud his talent and his success all americans all americans should be proud of his accomplishment i know i am
6080482 my concern with senator obama is on big issues and small issues what he says and what he does are often two different things and that he doesnt seem to understand that the policies he offers would make our problems harder not easier to solve
6080483 nearly a million dollars for every working day hes been in office
6080484 for tax hikes that would have impacted those making 32 000 a year
6080485 who can you thank for rising prices at the pump
6080486 it wasnt until the last weeks of the primary that clinton and her campaign really took the gloves off on obama and as it happens it was too little too late
6080487 obama is at his best when he talks from the mountaintop and clinton showed that the best hope for an opponent is to pull him back down to earth mccains campaign quickly decided not to wait as long as she did
6080488 i think the campaign does have to be careful about its tone
6080489 ya no responde ni al tel fono pende de un hilo la esperanza m a yo no cre jam s poder perder as la cabeza por l porque de pronto ya no me quer a porque mi vida se qued vac a etc
6080490 d someguy hey thought youd like to know your shoe is untied
6080491 hello mr sullivan we found something strange in your window youre not going to believe this but somebody jammed an empty cigarette package down into your door frame i dont know what they were trying to do but there it was when we opened it up

6080493 mr sullivan we did the tune up replaced the rotors and pads patched your tire and were working on getting that window up however the bushings are shot on your control arm

6080498 in a business where scale matters the complementary product portfolios contributed by the parent companies will deliver significant scale and synergies by leveraging and expanding the existing strategic cooperation
6080499 this was the first match i have ever played where i was truly nervous because if we had lost i would have been devastated
6080500 its a weight off our shoulders i was doing everything not to think about the match i was going online watching tv going to the supermarket
6080501 renato struggled with dalhasussers block and that made him change his strategy and make a lot of mistakes it was a bad performance

6080515 credit concerns in the us financial sector are still stalking investors here
6080516 even if investors buy the dollar temporarily they do so only because other major currencies are not attractive
6080517 you see your status as secretary of state of the usa is fast becoming as pathetic as your status as national security advisor was back in the days of 9 11 when you failed to provide any security whatsoever for your people

6080526 i think the test runs will be fine we have to run it in just like a car and first we have to commission the modern safety equipment
6080527 i still have to pinch myself that after 18 years we have done it
6080528 tornado has been the talk of the railway enthusiast community for years but now shes finally ready to run the whole world is taking notice
6080529 it is something we have been excited about right from the beginning when the idea was first germinated back in 1990
6080530 it was a nightmare actually something i dont like talking about really
6080531 but it was something ill never forget it was hard
6080532 it will be like that forever one side will not work but the other side will
6080533 but she can talk thats the main thing and she can sing as well
6080534 they are mainly looking for new voters all those republicans for a day amp young voters they are anticipating all the money that will come flowing in
6080535 if you are thirsty come to me and drink have faith in me and you will have life giving water flowing from deep inside you
6080536 it was one of the toughest races ive ever done
6080537 this would definitely go down as my best win not only because it was history and my home ground but because i drove one of my best ever races
6080538 i want to dedicate this to my family because as you can see ive had some troubles over the last couple of weeks and its been really tough
6080539 but as always your family are there when you need them
6080540 its difficult to say its a work in progress were doing a good job and ive just got to keep building on it were in a good place now but theres a lot of competition
6080541 the last couple of weeks ive been flat out with working very hard just a lot of travelling many different things and different emotions building
6080542 ive had a couple of bad races and coming here i was just thinking it would have been nice to get some points and maybe a win i thought a one two would be possible
6080543 my minds always been right i just had a lot on my plate really its nothing too serious just life in general
6080544 some of my personal life working very hard just before the race i spoke to my brother and said i just hope i keep it on the track and he said dont worry about that youre a master in the wet that was great to hear that
6080545 the most overwhelming experience it took a lot out of me just to work out what was going on
6080546 to be honest the most draining thing was not wanting to let down the fans that whole build up
6080547 there are no get out clauses other than the fact we have to be at the suitable standard by that time
6080548 we have a plan we have the investment ready so we will be there
6080549 if were not ready in the same way that if anybody else wasnt ready then im sure bernie ecclestone would look to do something as he cannot jeopardise the grand prix
6080550 but as there arent any other alternatives we will be there at 2010
6080551 i think everyone will be surprised at how little needs to be done to get donington park ready to host a formula one grand prix
6080552 we already host the moto gp and host crowds in excess of 90 000
6080553 we have a track that is not far off from being suitable for f1 at the moment we only ran a grand prix in 1993 we have to build a new pit paddock and infratstructure

6080570 favorite people who work at the white house but who are not in the spotlight
6080571 the press here does a fantastic job of adhering to journalistic standards and covering politics in general

6080588 gay people have to stay in touch with their roots and those roots are old hollywood movies and books like valley of the dolls whether they realise it or not

6080597 people we met on the trails were always asking about the plants so we thought why not write a bit of information and make it available to the public
6080598 we felt that people are more likely to remember the plants they see during a walk if they correlate it with a story or an interesting fact
6080599 with such a diversity of land and micro climates combined with the changing of seasons its easy to imagine the variety of plant species growing in this city park all of it is easily seen along the inviting trails

6080608 this erotic romance by ms da costa is one of the best i have ever had the pleasure to read and i am looking forward to reading many more by her
6080609 more pleasure than you could ever imagine ive become addicted
6080610 a pretty amusing if silly sex romp that will most likely fit the bill if you are looking for something naughty to read
6080611 with her usual strength of character sense of fun and powerfully passionate prose portia da costa shows us that even the lifeless hearts of the undead can still beat with the stirrings of romance
6080612 hotbed is a perfect showcase for portia da costas inestimable talent
6080613 suite seventeen contains all portias trademark treats from the arousing narrative a wicked blend of deviant episodes and an undercurrent of pragmatic and poignant romance
6080614 i would have stayed up all night long to finish reading this book i just cant get enough of portia da costa
6080615 continuum is an intelligent articulate foray into an erotic world lurking just beneath our civilised society
6080616 witty engaging narrative strong characters and description so vivid the scenes rise three dimensionally from the page
6080617 it is an interference in our internal affairs and we strongly oppose it
6080618 we appeal to people of jammu as well as kashmir to enter into dialogue and resolve the issue and work for maintaining and preserving composite culture communal harmony peace and tranquillity
6080619 we will certainly meet amarnath sangrash samiti leaders and persuade them to enter into talks

6080625 for anger to be substantial enough to preclude the attorney from knowing or understanding what he was doing it would have to be substantial enough to the point that disability proceedings or interim suspension would be appropriate anger to a lesser degree could be probative along with other circumstantial clues as to the attorneys actual knowledge and intent in committing the misconduct

6080627 obama may dislike hillary but will conclude he has no choice but to get over it if he hopes to leave next weeks convention in denver with a unified party and a decent shot against john mccain in the fall the polls show 25 percent of her supporters have not gotten on board
6080628 my loyalty is to the democrats winning barack obama is going to have a serious problem getting elected for good reason the party needs to face the fact that without hillary clinton on the ticket the democrats will probably lose
6080629 if he obama determines that hillary after all is the best choice to help him to win and to govern they are capable of pulling off what would be the greatest head fake in american political history
6080630 it was like a reawakening it was like being born again for me
6080631 the nursery brought the baby down with connie and held him up to johns face
6080632 and john just cracked the biggest smile on his face the unit got quiet and then you just heard people crying it was a beautiful sight

6080636 soy la misma mujer sencilla de siempre que hace cola atiende su casa sigo igual aunque internamente me siento ahora m s humana que antes lo alcanzado hasta aqu me ha permitido trazarme un objetivo en la vida seguir contribuyendo desde cualquier trinchera a eliminar el analfabetismo esa es la injusticia social m s grande que he visto en la vida porque cada analfabeto est asociado al hambre a la miseria al desempleo a condiciones infrahumanas y cuando t le das una cartilla y un l piz esa persona te besa y te abraza como si le hubieras dado lo m s grande del mundo entonces como es tanto el amor que he recibido creo que tengo que seguir pagando as con amor
6080637 en aquel momento solo sent que hab a hecho realidad una idea del comandante cumpl a una misi n y nada m s como hacemos todos los cubanos
6080638 solo durante la realizaci n del primer congreso mundial de alfabetizaci n un encuentro de los educadores que trabajamos en bien de la humanidad comenc a comprender la real magnitud pol tica de la tarea la idea verdadera de fidel que no es solo alfabetizar sino vindicar a los excluidos de la tierra lograr un movimiento social que los una como seres humanos transformar el mundo en ese congreso casi me sorprendo aunque nunca averiguo cu ntos alfabetizados ya hay por el m todo yo s puedo ni por cu ntos pa ses anda no pregunto para evitar el susto
6080639 soy la misma mujer sencilla de siempre que hace cola atiende su casa sigo igual aunque internamente me siento ahora m s humana que antes lo alcanzado hasta aqu me ha permitido trazarme un objetivo en la vida seguir contribuyendo desde cualquier trinchera a eliminar el analfabetismo esa es la injusticia social m s grande que he visto en la vida porque cada analfabeto est asociado al hambre a la miseria al desempleo a condiciones infrahumanas y cuando t le das una cartilla y un l piz esa persona te besa y te abraza como si le hubieras dado lo m s grande del mundo entonces como es tanto el amor que he recibido creo que tengo que seguir pagando as con amor
6080640 con su mano sobre mi hombro y t sabes cu nto pesa esa mano es algo muy grande ya sinti ndome por dentro el compromiso que aquello significaba me dio varias sugerencias pensando en el uso de la televisi n para alfabetizar hacer una cartilla de cuatro o cinco p ginas y para elaborarla combinar los n meros con las letras y empezar por la palabra casa
6080641 aun sin partir de ning n supuesto pedag gico o cient fico l sab a que las personas iletradas conoc an los n meros y ese fue el argumento la palabra casa deb a ser la primera explic porque se pod a traducir f cilmente a otros idiomas y porque de alguna forma tambi n el analfabeto conoce lo que es si no la tiene sabe cu n necesaria resulta y si la tiene lucha much simo por mantenerla
6080642 porque imag nate t combinar los n meros con las letras es realmente algo dif cil ya hab amos hecho una cartilla muy amplia para la radio y aunque l no lo expres cuando conversamos sent que no le satisfac a porque era demasiado amplia al sugerirme una de pocas p ginas yo estaba percibiendo una cr tica muy sutil muy delicada pero una cr tica
6080643 organic entonces los n meros de acuerdo con la frecuencia de uso de cada una de esas consonantes y a las vocales en el mismo orden que se conocen les otorgu del uno al cinco
6080644 hubiera sido f cil adoptar el m todo para ense ar la lectoescritura en la primaria donde tambi n hay un orden para el aprendizaje
6080645 despu s de numerar del uno al cinco a las vocales la primera consonante que aprender an asociada al n mero seis decid que ser a la l de trazo f cil para aquellos que nunca han tomado un l piz y entre sus manos torpes de tanto trabajo rudo les parece un instrumento demasiado fr gil y a la vez impresionante
6080646 este m todo persigue ser amigable optimista crear un estado emocional favorable para elevar la autoestima y garantizar as un aprendizaje r pido eficaz a partir de los conocimientos de los propios participantes
6080647 en venezuela espec ficamente les llamamos patriotas participantes porque hay que ser un verdadero patriota para incorporarse a los 102 a os a un proceso de alfabetizaci n o a los 80 a los 70 cuando todo el mundo te ha dicho que no se puede
6080648 todav a no hab a elaborado el manual del facilitador quien ayuda a alfabetizar cuando salimos para venezuela luego de una bell sima despedida que nos hizo nuestro comandante
6080649 sin pedirle permiso al comandante ra l cuando le en un cartel su frase de s se puede decid tomarla al verla me dije es optimista da confianza y toda misi n que cuba emprenda debe llevar ese signo la esperanza y el convencimiento de que es posible hacerlo

6080843 i had a little bit of experience when i went to new trier township high school in the chicago suburb of winnetka ill there was a short lived band i was in called collective moss
6080844 we only played two gigs we were the worlds worst cover band we were just awful
6080845 but i could read music and thats how i learned the tracks for the rocker i would tape the score on the drum set and learn to play that way this made it easier for me to pick up the rhythm

6080849 theyre not cerebral i have a tendency in my life to be more cerebral and a bit reserved but hes a big puppy dog a physical person and a talk first think later type with his heart on his sleeve it was lot of fun to plunge into that
6080850 there was no specific drummer who i based my character on
6080851 it was a compilation of watching the heavy metal drummers on youtube i recommend that to anyone start researching hair metal drummers
6080852 there are similarities between dwight schrute and fish and there are differences
6080853 but there has to be enough similarities so the office fans will line up when the rocker opens to see the guy who plays dwight play a heavy metal rocker dude it was just a blast to enter into that whole genre of music
6080854 ive been very fortunate because dwight schrute comes from the writers and creator greg daniels they arent interested in doing things the normal way things have been done
6080855 they want to find different facets and different sides to all the characters
6080856 when you see dwights vulnerabilities people respond to it and are more likely to tune in then we get to make more episodes

6080873 peace advocates anatol rapoport and leonard johnson a retired canadian general compare our society to the cells of a body in the process of committing suicide all the cells keep operating normally each doing its own job even as the person writes a suicide note puts a gun in his mouth and prepares to pull the trigger

6080886 this will give him the opportunity to impress me more and possibly gain a longer contract
6080887 losing yantorno is a big blow but kissock is an exciting young player
6080888 education is a companion which no future can depress no crime can destroy no enemy can alienate it and no nepotism can enslave
6080889 i know whats real and whats not real so it doesnt bother me
6080890 i dont regret anything i did im picking things up every week
6080891 give us a chance to show what we can do we havent played to our full ability yet

6080903 i was involved in working with the kids during the digital imaging course which was organised in conjunction with wheelworks
6080904 there were also two courses organised to teach local children about digital music software which was of great interest to the young people and possible future djs
6080905 our aim was to get the children off the streets and learning worthwhile skills as part of our annual summer scheme
6080906 although we arrange many events for local youngsters like going to the cinema etc this is the first time we have introduced the kids to what wheelworks has to offer
6080907 but hopefully it will not be the last as they learned so many new skills and had so much fun the great thing about the project was that the children did not even have to leave the area as the artcart came to us
6080908 the artcart is wheelworks unique mobile arts vehicle delivering a range of arts based projects to young people directly in their own communities
6080909 on board young people have access to the latest software computers and equipment and work with professional wheelworks artists
6080910 thirty children took part in one of the three part programme which introduced them either to digital imaging or digital music
6080911 our digital imaging workshops involved the youngsters learning the basics of using digital cameras and adobe photoshop software to make their own enhanced image on our state of the art imac computers
6080912 many of the children have never used the software and were delighted to learn many new skills some of them even said they would like to get a new camera and take up photography
6080913 the volunteers worked very hard to produce a colourful and creative piece of art for the borough
6080914 ards borough council is delighted to be involved in this project in recognition of the ards tts legendary status both at home and abroad
6080915 it is after all an important part of motor sports history and indeed was considered to be one of the best courses in the world by some of the best drivers
6080916 it is also however a significant part of our areas own history and connected with our long proud and on going association with motorsport in all its forms from today locals visitors and future generations will be reminded of the historic ards tt races every time they enter conway square
6080917 i decided to climb a tree and hide there i chose a tree that is not a favorite of elephants i knew them since we used to receive lessons on animals and the trees they prefer
6080918 a change in the relative prices of the factors of production is itself a spur to invention and to invention of a particular kind directed to economizing the use of a factor which has become relatively expensive
6080919 a wonderful hotel in a fantastic part of the world
6080920 this wonderful restaurant imho is the best place to close a deal

6080923 michael had not worked for over six years due to suffering from sociophobia and a downward spiral of depression
6080924 sociophobia is an extreme fear of socialising fear of embarrassment in social situations
6080925 it is intrusive and has a markedly debilitating effect on relationships in extreme cases a sociophobe may begin to avoid all social situations and become housebound
6080926 the jobcentre were sensitive to my needs once i saw carole my adviser things started to click into place i was guided at the right pace
6080927 michael was supposed to start by doing a few hours a day but not only did he work full time but he volunteered to do extra shifts and nothing was too much trouble for him he turned up early every day and he loved it
6080928 its hard work but fulfilling there is nothing i dislike working with animals is more comfortable and less complicated
6080929 there are so many things that im getting from the job the dogs really appreciate what i do for them
6080930 at the same time muslims already living on the continent are having three times as many children as their white european neighbors
6080931 we really need to make a statement to the community that we believe the bible thou shall not kill
6080932 we go to the abortion clinics and tell people there are other alternatives to educate people you dont have to do this
6080933 if mr lawson didnt expend so much ink shilling for developers then i might agree that he deserves an homage or two he may indeed be the kind of business reporter that mr kotz claims i cant tell for all of the apologetics he writes on behalf of development and for his unsubstantiated insinuations about community leaders who advocate balance in growth
6080934 i felt some pressure during the performance but i tried to tell myself that it was training not a competition
6080935 chen and wang won the synchronized platform event last week heymans had the top rated opening dive
6080936 musica e arte sotto le stelle 2008 che animer la fortezza vecchia di livorno leggi tutto
6080937 it is disappointing to me it is not a statute but a rule perhaps we could look at the quick ability to amend the rule i think the citizens who have been violated through an illegal background search deserve to know what happened to them
6080938 it is mere rashness to seek death but it is cowardly to refuse it
6080939 to pray for the other publicly as a post soviet evangelical church is therefore an important step on what must still be a long road toward reconciliation given the many many negatives that have circulated
6080940 and we believe we will be able to find contact with one another and continue our dialogue
6080941 no great theological chasm exists between registered churches and unregistered churches many chinese christians attend both
6080942 however there is a difference between registered and unregistered churches in political attitude
6080943 for the lords sake accept the authority of every human institution
6080944 the political attitude of the unregistered churches reflects the theology of the book of revelation they assume that the chinese government being communist in ideology is pagan and satanic most unregistered churches do not believe that christianity should collaborate with a government that does not love or honor god
6080945 with bible printing and devotional and theological books coming off the presses chinas christians are in the most hopeful and open society they have known in centuries they have limited freedoms but are doing much more with their adjusted freedoms than many other places are
6080946 chose to ignore local and national leadership and began covert work
6080947 so they and some others chose cloak and dagger secret christian witness in china which is absolutely unnecessary christianity is one of five officially recognized religions in china
6080948 where the sbc foreign mission board failed was early on in 1984 when they promised to work with the ccc and be there to help in any way they could
6080949 went that way without informing me i was viewed as too close to the ccc national leadership and not trusted as a covert agent
6080950 k h bishop ting told me what they were doing and asked me to do something our leadership was surprised that k h knew and were not happy with me
6080951 they wanted us to go and we did i see it as another element of the fundamentalist takeover of the sbc
6080952 i am told that those sent to unreached peoples particularly to countries where missionaries are not admitted or not welcomed sometimes misrepresent themselves as specialists who have no relation to mission boards though in fact they have been sent and are supported by mission boards
6080953 this is the kind of dishonesty which cannot be squared with christian ethics
6080954 such practices cannot be condoned to assume that one has to forsake truth to have access to people where missionaries are not admitted is not only shoddy ethics but also poor theology
6080955 the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church
6080956 in such a vast and populous country the tolerance for religious practice varies greatly
6080957 but you can never count on that being permanent its a cat and mouse game and its dangerous
6080958 an agent of the government house church leaders do not regard the tspm and the china christian council ccc as authentic representatives of the chinese church hence it is hard for them to be reconciled with their betrayers who are still betraying them
6080959 the tspm recently asked the public security bureau to shut down all house church meetings and arrest house church leaders and traveling evangelists
6080960 bishop ding also started a theological reconstruction campaign among the official seminaries the purpose is to change the focus of teaching from justification by faith alone in jesus christ to justification by love in doing good deeds under the guidance of tspm and the state administration of religious affairs sara religious messages are to be made compatible with socialism pastors are discouraged from preaching about jesus divinity miracles or resurrection so that believers and non believers can be united together to build a prosperous socialist china
6080961 all of it is lies k h is not that kind of man
6080962 pleading for the government to spare the students and not do anything rash
6080963 because bike zhang met the americans and destroyed the harmony of the beijing olympic games
6080964 bishop ting now a very old man went along with the three self policy in china when mao first promoted it in the late 1950s
6080965 the worst was yet to come the cultural revolution swept aside those who compromised just as it did those who refused to compromise the parallel with stalin and the russian orthodox church in 1929 is uncanny so ever so slowly the three self movement and the new unregistered churches emerged in the late 1970s it was the latter who now showed unbelievable fortitude in the face of continuing persecution the number of new converts justifying the stand they had taken but the three self churches made progress too less spectacular perhaps but progress nevertheless
6080966 the position with the roman catholic church is more clear cut the government controlled church which has had to cut its ties with the vatican does not have the moral authority found with the persecuted church whose bishops the vatican appoints cardinal zen in hong kong stands firmly behind the latter a thorn in the flesh for the beijing authorities
6080967 comparison with former soviet union is very tenuous after the 1917 revolution the russian government saw the church as one of its main enemies the orthodox church had extensive land holdings etc in china christians never had such a huge presence christianity in china was not then and is not now as highly institutionalized as in russia
6080968 there are places in china particulary in inland china where the local government leaders are not following the national policies so there are abuses of religious freedom but the tendency in the western media is to accentuate the problems china aid and others think the only way the church can exist in china is to confront the government
6080969 bishop ting presided over the most extraordinary time in the chinese church in the 20th century he helped recreate institutions developed theological education printed bibles and religious literature he did so by cooperation not confrontation
6080970 for he himself knows our frame he is mindful that we are but dust

6080992 it would have been nice if we could have said that on stage but we think it was a good recognition for us that we care for our core fans and not just the new people who are now discovering nintendo
6080993 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god your playing small does not serve the world there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you we were born to make manifest the glory of god that is within us it is not just in some of us it is in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others
6080994 trust yourself create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement

6081019 this libertarian awakening has had a strong influence on me i was particularly inspired by congressman ron paul
6081020 i am a canadian citizen currently living and working in hong kong last month i wrote a song called liberty it was inspired by dr ron paul and is dedicated to all the people of america you can listen to or download a copy from my website
6081021 i am an airline pilot not a professional musician but i believe that something big is definitely happening and ron paul is inspiring people from all over the world not just the united states

6081028 argentinas crushing 3 0 win over brazil in their olympic games semi final was another demonstration of how the two great football rivals have swapped roles in the last few years argentina often associated with pragmatic defence and gamesmanship have adopted a stylish passing game while brazil have exchanged their previous flamboyance for brute force and counter attacks
6081029 excessively high rate of accidents among temporary short term and low qualified workers
6081030 we are still of the view stubborn as we are that we have not seen the end of the problems and therefore financials have not made a relative bottom
6081031 we still have in this country thousands of banks we dont need thousands of banks pick your favorite european country you can count the number of banks on one maybe two hands

6081041 it may well be we will take measures the ioc took the measures with the olympic games we could also do similar things and take out sanctions with regard to the world championships
6081042 that makes it bittersweet id have been really upset if shed won gold the penalty you should pay if you take drugs is not to compete at the olympics
6081043 the ioc was very clear in the lead up we would work in concert with all the anti doping bodies
6081044 we feel the deterrent effect plays a part in what we see here the athletes know the ioc means business
6081045 i got the call that they were in front of german brothers marina
6081046 i get up to german brothers and theres no boats in sight
6081047 it was very very loud and there was lots of lightning

6081078 the rebuilder uses a tiny electrical signal to wake up nerves that are temporarily dormant or asleep due to past oxygen deprivation the rebuilders patent pending signal is a precise copy of a healthy nerve signals but stronger this healing signal travels from one foot up that leg across the synaptic junctions and nerve roots in your lower back and then down to your other foot then it reverses the polarity and this nerve impulse then travels back to your original foot
6081079 another factor to consider is the negative side effects that your prescription medicines may have on your neuropathy these powerful drugs work by interfering with the signals from your extremities so that the brain does not receive these signals this is performed at the nerve roots of your lower back this may help the pain for a while but soon your body will accommodate and require a higher dose

6081088 our board of directors remains committed to capital preservation during these times of challenging industry conditions and as a sign of that commitment unanimously elected to forego payment to serve on the board
6081089 the decision to suspend dividends was not taken lightly especially given security banks history of continuous quarterly dividend payments for over eleven years however we believe maintaining a strong capital position is a priority at this time and eliminating our dividend will improve our capital position by conserving approximately 1 million of capital per quarter

6081300 this is a lone demonstrator the leaflet does not request contributions or break capitol police regulations the applicant has an application on file with special events any questions should be directed to special events us capitol police
6081301 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6081302 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6081303 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6081304 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6081305 the acquisition of london mining brasil along with our investment in mpp ensures that our iron ore base is further diversified in the face of tighter supply for raw materials
6081306 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6081307 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6081308 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6081309 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6081310 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6081311 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6081312 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6081313 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6081314 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6081315 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6081316 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6081317 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6081318 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6081319 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6081320 who are open to doing something on the production side
6081321 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6081322 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6081323 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6081324 i think that in back of my mind i was hoping that one day i would feel well enough to see if the place was here
6081325 the tone of the august discussion confirms that the interest rate debate remains finely balanced for now
6081326 accordingly there is little here to suggest that other members are about to join blanchflower in voting for a cut in the very near future
6081327 nonetheless with inflation close to a peak and the economy heading towards recession we still think rates could be falling by year end and will eventually drop much further than the markets expect
6081328 most members of the committee judged that the current stance of monetary policy was broadly appropriate and that bank rate should be maintained at five percent this month
6081329 inflation was likely to move further above the governments 2 0 percent target in the coming months the outlook for activity growth had continued to worsen but some build up in the margin of spare capacity was likely to be necessary to ensure that inflation returned to the target in the medium term
6081330 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6081331 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6081332 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6081333 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6081334 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6081335 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6081336 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6081337 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6081338 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6081339 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6081340 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6081341 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6081342 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6081343 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6081344 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6081345 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6081346 fue el primer conflicto armado que se sigui casi en directo
6081347 a veces pensaba que lo har an antes los americanos y acabar amos tir ndonos de los pelos
6081348 how many times could you even whip a horse in a 4 furlong race
6081349 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6081350 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6081351 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6081352 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6081353 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6081354 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6081355 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6081356 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6081357 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6081358 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6081359 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6081360 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6081361 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6081362 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6081363 when we go out to eat we try to be economical and we buy less groceries
6081364 theres a reluctance to let go of your money in case there are too many other bills to pay before the months over
6081365 were finding that the rate of people coming into continuing care retirement communities has slowed dramatically mainly because of their inability to sell their houses
6081366 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6081367 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6081368 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6081369 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6081370 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6081371 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6081372 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6081373 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6081374 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6081375 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6081376 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6081377 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6081378 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6081379 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6081380 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6081381 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6081382 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6081383 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6081384 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6081385 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6081386 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6081387 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6081388 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6081389 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6081390 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6081391 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6081392 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6081393 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6081394 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6081395 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

6081397 some investors are concerned about potential government interference and regulatory changes increased competition and the lack of current geographical asset diversification

6081399 higher oil and oil product prices and a break on federal taxes helped profits spike 29 to 8 78 billion reals 5 46 billion u s revenue during the quarter jumped 30 to 54 57 billion reals approximately 33 9 billion u s
6081400 while increasing product prices added to the top and bottom lines production increases were additionally beneficial total output increased to about 2 39 million barrels of oil equivalent per day

6081407 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6081408 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6081409 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

6081505 the political parties are moving at snails pace and are rather conservative

6081509 i would say that the most significant course i took at the university of chicago was a badly conceived one that was in effect a history of the development of the novel this course was ill taught by an under confident instructor not yet thirty the reading equivalent of a marathon in ten weeks the course went at the rate of a novel per week from the princess of cleves through ulysses with stops along the way for jane austen stendhal dostoevsky flaubert mann and proust what do you suppose a boy of twenty gets out of reading swanns way my best guess is somewhere between 15 to 20 percent of what proust put into it
6081510 the endless details set out in novels the thoughts of imaginary characters the dramatization of large themes through carefully constructed plots the portrayals of how the world works really works these were among the things that literature carefully attended to might one day help me to learn

6081574 at the same time we are pleased to aid our sister community in providing tax incentives to two major east longmeadow employers in support of their continued investment in their facilities to help retain and expand their businesses
6081575 it is a tool that will help foster competitive advantages for doing business here
6081576 businesses in east longmeadows industrial garden district will have opportunities for example to use the eta status to expand operations and in turn create jobs since a significant amount of the workforce there is from springfield the economic benefits will be realized in the city as well

6081592 the outraged women of mount isa felt that the mayors comments were archaic and it is totally not the image that we want to project for our city
6081593 i wont be resigning because im quite comfortable with what i said
6081594 mount isa my city has taken the olympic games off the front page of papers all over australia and the world and ive never heard of that happening before people have supported me everywhere and at the moment i feel like im sitting on the top of mount kosciusko
6081595 the country has produced some of the worlds most prominent feminists germaine greer carmen callil lynne segal
6081596 in fact if theres one aspect of the mount isa story that really stands out for me its the womens response as we went to press they were organising a protest rally on the lawns of the civic centre now thats the spirit
6081597 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
6081598 the evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain
6081599 no evidence sufficient to support the claim that an observed association between abortion history and mental health was caused by the abortion per se as opposed to other factors
6081600 global statements about the psychological impact of abortion can be misleading
6081601 we aim to be the most competitive marketplace online and this new incredibly low pricing helps us achieve that goal

6081606 as the only standards body that touches every travel industry segment opentravel plays a primary role in the distribution of information and inventory
6081607 participation in industry events provides a forum for opentravel to hear what its members and the broader industry are talking about this supports the continuing efforts of opentravel to educate the marketplace regarding the benefits of implementing their standards
6081608 we are regular participants at the travel distribution summit events and we find many of our conversations include the topic of distribution strategies standards and technologies
6081609 opentravel standards form the basis of industry leading distribution solutions so it seems natural that our members would be widely represented on the speaker list at an event dedicated to electronic distribution in the travel industry

6081624 it did not take long for the discussion to center on the olympics with espn executives questioning nbcs decision to tape delay programming from michael phelps races on the west coast to the opening ceremony
6081625 when we put a live bug on sportscenter it means live right now at espn it just would not be part of our dna to tape delay the most important sporting event of the day
6081626 im glad to see that nbc has adopted that approach with the olympics because it validates the approach weve taken for years
6081627 espn is interested in bidding for the next round of olympic games 2014 and 2016 which will take place before october 09

6081639 environmentalists always claim to be stakeholders but every day that they succeed in delaying the use of ddt and other insecticides another 3 000 to 5 000 people die from malaria those victims and the half billion who get this disease every year who lie in bed shaking with convulsions who cant work or go to school who end up with permanent brain damage from malaria they are the real stakeholders its their views that count
6081640 people are the cause of all the problems we have too many of them we need to get rid of some of them and this referring to malaria deaths is as good a way as any

6081643 gentlemen at a time when in all probability the whole united colonies of america are upon the verge of a glorious revolution and when consequently the most important questions that were ever agitated before the representative body of this colony touching its internal police will demand your attention your constituents think it necessary to instruct you in several matters what part to act that the path of your duty may be plain before you
6081644 we have seen the humble petitions of these colonies to the king of great britain repeatedly rejected with disdain
6081645 a reconciliation with them appears to us to be as dangerous as it is absurd
6081646 touching the internal policy of this colony it is essentially necessary in order to preserve harmony among ourselves that the constituent body be satisfied that they are fairly and fully represented the right to legislate is originally in every member of the
6081647 it is essential to liberty that the legislative judicial and executive powers of government be as nearly as possible independent of and separate from each other for where they are united in the same person or number of persons there would be wanting that mutual check which is the principal security against the making of arbitrary laws and a wanton exercise of power in the execution of them it is also of the highest importance that every person in a judiciary department employ the greatest part of his time and attention in the duties of his office we therefore further instruct you to procure the enacting such law or laws as shall make it incompatible for the same person to hold a seat in the legislative and executive departments of government at one and the same time that shall render the judges in every judicatory through the colony dependant not on the uncertain tenure of caprice or pleasure but on an unimpeachable deportment in the important duties of their station for their continuance in office and to prevent the multiplicity of offices in the same person that such salaries be settled upon them as will place them above the necessity of stooping to any indirect or collateral means for subsistence we wish to avoid a profusion of the publick moneys on the one hand and the danger of sacrificing our liberties to a spirit of parsimony on the other not doubting of your zeal and abilities in the common cause of our country we leave your discretion to promote such exertions in promoting any military operations as the exigencies of our publick affairs may require and in the same confidence of your fervour and attachment to the publick weal we readily submit all other matters of publick moment that may require your consideration to your own wisdom and discretion

6081651 there has been a lot of doubt within the international community that there are health outcomes of health tests and patient centred consultations within primary care
6081652 in denmark general practitioners are gate keepers to the entire health system almost all danes are ascribed to specific general practitioners such findings suggest that clinicians and policy makers should now consider implementing health tests and consultations more widely
6081653 our findings provide a basis for opening up new therapeutic approaches to protect neurons from inflammation and toxicity induced neurodegeneration
6081654 selective cox 2 inhibitors were thought to be a promising medicine in treating neurodegenerative diseases stroke cancers and inflammation related diseases like arthritis however the occurrence of a series of cardiovascular complications in patients receiving cox 2 inhibitors has led to their recent withdrawal from the market and limits on their usages our research has shown that the use of endogenous cannabinoid 2 ag may avoid such side effects therefore elevation of endogenous 2 ag levels by facilitating its production inhibiting its decomposition or directly supplying 2 ag may result in treatment advances to prevent the devastation of disorders like stroke alzheimers and traumatic brain injury
6081655 sponges have one of the most ancient lineages and dont have nerve cells
6081656 so we are pretty confident it was after the sponges split from trunk of the tree of life and sponges went one way and animals developed from the other that nerves started to form
6081657 what we found in sponges though were the building blocks for nerves something we never expected to find
6081658 what we have done is try to find the molecular building blocks of nerves or what may be called the nerves ancestor the proto neuron
6081659 we found sets of these genes in sponges when we really didnt expect it
6081660 but what was really cool is we took some of these genes and expressed them in frog and flies and the sponge gene became functional the sponge gene directed the formation of nerves in these more complex animals

6081684 the southern ocean is a hotspot for climate research because its circulation is critical to understanding the earths climate and its huge ice sheet is sensitive to climate change
6081685 southern elephant seals are wide ranging predators that roam all over the southern ocean even under the sea ice in the wintertime a time when conventional ocean observation methods are unable to gather data
6081686 i think this is an extremely exciting new approach for ocean observation which has now been extended to seals roaming the seas around both poles as part of the international polar year ipy
6081687 im flattered that sen schuring has finally embraced energy ideas ive been talking about for months but im disappointed it took him this long to realize people are concerned about high gas prices unfortunately his plan still doesnt provide enough short term solutions to our high gas prices and i think voters will wonder whether someone who raised their gas taxes and has taken 20 000 from oil executives is really serious about making the big energy policy changes we need

6081697 for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins
6081698 therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life
6081699 here is the resulting dialogue when a woman in the audience reminded her of jesus
6081700 do you think that if you are somewhere on the planet and you never hear the name of jesus but yet you live with a loving heart you lived as jesus would have had you to live you lived for the same purpose that jesus came to the planet to teach us all but you are in some remote part of the earth and you never heard the name of jesus you cannot get to heaven you think
6081701 does god care about your heart or does god care whether you call his son jesus
6081702 jesus cannot come back until that gospel is preached in the four corners of this earth so you know figure it out
6081703 ok i cant get into a religious argument with you
6081704 for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse
6081705 behold the former things are come to pass and new things do i declare before they spring forth i tell you of them
6081706 howbeit when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come he shall glorify me christ for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you all things that the father has are mine therefore said i that he shall take of mine and shall show it unto you
6081707 i think we do we have different routes of getting to the almighty but i want you to understand i want your listeners to understand i dont get to decide who goes to heaven the almighty god decides who goes to heaven and i am on my personal walk
6081708 i believe in an almighty god and i believe that all the world whether they be muslim christian or any other religion prays to the same god i believe there is a universal god i believe the god that the muslim prays to is the same god that i pray to after all we all came from abraham i believe in that universality
6081709 those who through no fault of their own do not know the gospel of christ or his church but who nevertheless seek god with a sincere heart and moved by grace try in their actions to do his will as they know it through the dictates of their conscience those too may achieve eternal salvation
6081710 but what about those faiths the mormons and the others that you mentioned believe in christ they believe they will meet christ what about those like the jews the muslims who dont believe they
6081711 how do you feel when you see a lot of these strong christian leaders go on television and say you are condemned you will live in hell if you do not accept jesus christ and they are forceful and judgmental
6081712 well they have a right to say that and they are true to a certain extent but i dont thats not my calling my calling is to preach the love of god and the forgiveness of god and the fact that he does forgive us thats what the cross is all about what the resurrection is all about thats the gospel and you can get off on all kinds of different side trends and in my earlier ministry i did the same but as i got older i guess i became more mellow and more forgiving and more loving
6081713 because strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leads unto life and few there be that find it
6081714 neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved
6081715 in acts 16 30 31 a prison guard asks paul and silas this question when he sees that the power of god had broken their prison bands
6081716 he who has the son has life and he who has not the son of god has not life
6081717 jesus said unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man comes unto the father but by me
6081718 then said jesus unto them again verily verily i say unto you i am the door of the sheep all who ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the sheep did not hear them i am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture
6081719 salvation is defined as rescue from shame to glory it is salvation from guilt to pride from fear to love from distrust to faith from hypocrisy to honesty so lack of trust or a lack of self worth is the central core of sin

6081725 in its struggle against terrorism france has just been hard hit
6081726 my determination is intact france is committed to pursuing the struggle against terrorism for democracy and for freedom
6081727 this is a just cause it is an honour for france and for its army to defend it
6081728 serious measures notably in the air were taken to support and extricate our men caught in an extremely violent ambush
6081729 there were very violent battles that lasted several hours and an operation is still ongoing in the zone
6081730 what are the goals of this war how many troops will be needed to achieve its stated objectives what has been achieved by the military action and the reconstruction effort waged since 2001
6081731 these soldiers were doing their duty but they did not die for france they died in an unending war that the united states is waging in that country for its own interests
6081732 will have to explain better to the french what is the role of their soldiers there what they do there
6081733 he went for a scan and it confirmed there is no serious problem there
6081734 callum is only going to miss days rather than weeks so that is great news
6081735 there was pressure on us especially after losing opener gautam gambhir before the match
6081736 the most consequential zoom shot in the history of cinema
6081737 on may 26th memorial day i might add face it youre not getting an extension or pay up deadbeat
6081738 you guys have better things to do im not the guy
6081739 i cant even compare it to any football fields ive been to
6081740 i wanted so badly to get to the next round but the race was slow i felt all right but couldnt close with those guys

6081742 using language that is obscene offensive or of a seriously insulting nature to another player umpire referee team official or spectator
6081743 i accept that in international cricket there is a lot of passion but that does not excuse players talking back to umpires in an aggressive manner as happened in this case
6081744 that is unacceptable and i hope this decision and the fine imposed demonstrates that fact
6081745 ich mache seit 15 jahren actionfilme cobra 11 ist in 120 l nder verkauft da machen wir sechs film minuten am tag da schaffen wir auch 23 minuten f r eine daily wir machens auf video
6081746 originally it was going to be called bag it up and then it was going to be called the shock of the lightning and then it was going to be called standing on the edge of the noise
6081747 i couldnt think of any ideas and then somebody had taken bits of the lyrics out and dig out your soul was what came up i was like you know what titles become themselves
6081748 definitely maybe the bands 1994 debut isnt a great title
6081749 but if the album is good enough itll become itself
6081750 its a movie that would definitely lend itself to seeing further adventures
6081751 lets do death race 2 i had a terrific time working with this group of people pauls terrific if they want to make another one then im in
6081752 we did the movie that is the beginning of roger cormans original death race 2000 the genesis of the death race that is portrayed in that 1975 film
6081753 if you watch this movie you can imagine how that would develop into what roger portrayed
6081754 but there are aspects to the first movie that we havent really addressed in this movie
6081755 for example in the first movie you run people down for points in this movie certainly lots of people get run down you just dont score points if we did do another movie i would like to address that if this develops into a franchise it would be slowly building towards what rogers movie was it feels like that movie actually takes place about 20 years after the events of this movie
6081756 they the police told me privately they hate the fact he lives in wiltshire and they dont want him on their patch
6081757 the passage is about election sure but its about group election not individual election its about god ordaining that there will be a church not that individuals will be saved
6081758 what shall we say then is there injustice on gods part by no means
6081759 it depends not on human will or exertion but on god who has mercy he has mercy on whomever he wills and he hardens whomever he wills
6081760 why does he still find fault for who can resist his will
6081761 i know you might think that its unfair of god but im telling you that his choice isnt based on your choices or your actions verse 16 it is based solely on his choice and im guessing that you might conclude from that well if thats the way it is how can it be fair that god would find fault i have an answer for that
6081762 if thats the case do the objections that paul addresses make sense
6081763 what obama represents is we as a people are a part of the american dream
6081764 the message is for a kid from in marcy projects right now to say maybe i can be the president
6081765 not just for us blacks but also with all americans i think theres so much our president can do obama seems like a human being i say that because a lot of presidents dont seem like human beings they seem like straight up businessmen who care about nothing but the business
6081766 were a small part of it but were showing our support to show that we are aware of whats going on and where its going
6081767 we really want change we really need it its not the same no more
6081768 listen to what hes saying hes saying what i wanna hear just like my favorite rapper if an mc is saying what i wanna hear imma go buy his album if a candidate is saying what i wanna hear imma go vote for him i can vote by the way watch me im going to register to vote
6081769 i think the first thing the hip hop community has to do is let the man become president
6081770 they gotta work in other ways to get him in the white house its not really about doing a song right now he has to separate himself from that stuff hes in a political race everybody should kick back for a minute see what happens in november if he becomes president he wouldnt have to separate himself as much from some of these statements because obama cant come as hard core as ludacris as far as his message right now he cant do that us rappers might have to hold our tongues for a few months
6081771 all it takes is for a mutha er getting out there being real ghetto and people will be like we dont wanna f with obama theyll wanna smash on him because of what somebody else said someone speaks for himself and its baracks fault what did luda say thats baracks fault is it baracks fault what im saying i dont wanna be the reason he dont get the presidency
6081772 the most problematic hip hop gets 90 percent of the coverage in the non music press
6081773 hip hop is associated in so many peoples minds with crime drugs and misogyny so obamas faced with a constellation of problematic images the question is how do you send a message that doesnt wind up demonizing somebody
6081774 its cool to make a couple comments but be careful about what you say because theyre gonna try to pin it towards him
6081775 we know its so much tension around politics right now theyre trying to take him down maybe everybody needs to chill out a little bit im not sure how much barack mixtapes are helping him i dont think no person is doing a mixtape addressing baracks political views
6081776 i dont think luda or anybody ever thought it would be that big i heard the freestyle the minute it came out and in his defense thats what people do on the mixtape circuit ive put out multiple mixtapes where i might not actually feel a certain way about somebody but ill say a punch line to give them that shock value its nothing new to the mixtape circuit i dont think he really wants mccain in a wheelchair the lyric reads mccain dont belong in any chair unless hes paralyzed its just a freestyle thing it was crazy they took it that big
6081777 during this election young people from all walks of life have responded to senator obamas message of hope and change for the future with great enthusiasm
6081778 and that includes those in the hip hop community individuals who are talented intelligent and entrepreneurial in spirit but who in the past have felt that government and politics dont really work for them
6081779 senator obama wants to engage the hip hop community more in the political process because issues including education jobs and health care are as important to this generation as any other we will be talking to the hip hop community more throughout this campaign and letting them know they have reason to put their trust in senator obama because he will work to fundamentally change their lives
6081780 the hip hop experience is for some the black experience and the campaign has been very inclusive and has been one that has welcomed voices from all over the country
6081781 with the hip hop community its been an interesting conversation because on the one hand we know the hip hop community has reflected a great deal of whats been happening in our inner cities for a long time and the systemic challenges that face that community senator obama has a plan as part of his overall call for change that will address those challenges the voice of the hip hop community will be reflected in this campaign with senator obamas plan for inner city communities
6081782 these situations are a case by case basis when and where and timing
6081783 the hip hop community has clearly embraced senator obama and they see him as someone who can effect change in a dramatic way the key with us as we go through the next few months is identifying opportunities where we can work together to communicate the senators message
6081784 i thought about hip hop associations harming obamas chances i really did
6081785 so in the concert i always say this is not sponsored by obama i make it very clear to say that cause i know obama associated with this guy from f in marcy projects i know thats coming any day i think about that often i mean what do you do what do i do i have to support the guy but i dont wanna hurt him i aint like the preachers and all those guys i dont wanna make the inappropriate statements and keep going im the guy that will fall back
6081786 you gotta speak what you feel you gotta be respectful though
6081787 like anything you do you cant come to anybodys show and be disrespectful if youre supporting them so you dont speak on nobody and act a fool
6081788 in some ways you have to assume most of the hip hop community will be behind him because they dont have a choice because their vote aint going to mccain
6081789 but if he uses this kind of secret code the dirt off the shoulder saying you and i both know it but i cant afford to say so it could work for him
6081790 rappers have to realize that supporting obama publicly is like a corporate meeting come support us but dress for the occasion
6081791 if a king goes out and fights wars with his people his people will do anything for him
6081792 if youre just a king in your castle and you calling shots then the respect from the people will never be there we dont see our leaders with us in our situations on a heavy heavy level
6081793 a lot of people may not feel me on this but you gotta feel me if you real im not voting for obama
6081794 i dont like obama obama is a traitor he turned his back on everybody he turned his back on reverend jeremiah wright reverend wright has been with him since the beginning ludacris has done stuff in his support he speaks the truth but obama feels that a certain demographic may not vote for him because of it so he turns his back on luda he invited bernie mac to come in and do his roast or whatever it was called bernie mac said some things that were offensive thats what bernie mac is known for what does he do turn his back on bernie mac whos he gonna denounce next im not even voting this year if i did vote it would be for mccain i like to know the enemy barack i dont know
6081795 unless its something that happened with chris when it gets that serious its time to speak out
6081796 really my thing is i talked to the cats and its sad what people will do when theyre in the position of dont have
6081797 people will say omarion is still out there and in the pubic
6081798 i used to rock with them dudes and now when i see them its not like that
6081799 its gotta be like i look at you funny or you look at me funny if somebody has done something to disrespect you as a man i feel like i have to protect myself so now when i see them after everything that happened how do i be nice how do i be cool im a spiritual dude and a part of me is forgiving but there is so much that has been done you get tired of that this whole next album youll see a whole new omarion
6081800 a release is different from a drop when an artist is dropped usually they havent brought any revenue to the company as you know ive been with that company for a long time roughly over six years throughout b2k and my solo albums revenue was still brought in an artist like me could never get dropped how did i get dropped and i still ended up in a great situation usually when you hear drop it means oh hes over its a wrap its unfortunate that stuff like that gets put out there everybody likes to associate especially me being such a cool dude with negative things are you kidding me
6081801 hes a great producer and hes really at the top of his game right now
6081802 i cant ask for a better person to guide me we did ice box it wasnt enough for us to really build a solid relationship but ive got to spend time with him and we have a strong relationship its the biggest blessing that has happened to me musically
6081803 were just picking each others brains to see what can be done differently
6081804 my energetic style and aggressiveness when i perform i dont think thats necessarily been captured for the length of an album i always felt like i had joints like touch even entourage where its upbeat but it hasnt been captured in an album all these crazy new dances all these different things i wanna do when i look at my peers in the game they capture the true essence of who they are i kinda felt like throughout my career i had just blots of that
6081805 he was under pressure on debut especially against murali and mendis but he played them really well he took up the challenge and responsibility and showed some character
6081806 hes been performing consistently over the years back home and on india a tours it was reversing and turning a bit and at one end we had a batsman badrinath but the other end was open
6081807 it was badrinaths first game and he had the pressure of scoring thats what gives you confidence and the more experience you get the better you dont need to play 100 games for that even 25 such games will give you much more experience the more you are in these conditions the more comfortable you will be in the future it is good preparation but it takes its toll too you need to really concentrate
6081808 well im losing some hair but it is a pleasure to go out there under pressure and perform
6081809 thats what youre supposed to do at this level people expect you to score and its a privilege a win is always good because the morale goes up and you start believing you can deal with pressure once youre square you can look into the opponents eyes and tell them that if we play good cricket we can definitely beat you
6081810 ive been playing for four years and ive seen him bowl like this he has moved way ahead when it comes to his fielding as well hes there more than 100 he bowled really well in england too and its really good to have someone like him
6081811 at times when a bowler doesnt get wickets people tend to say hes a weak bowler but it is about the effort put in you wont always have a good day unless you bowl in partnerships you wont get wickets if zaheer struck praveen kumars impact was also good he bowled really well with the new ball
6081812 it was a deceptive pitch with something in it for the fast bowlers
6081813 in tough hot and humid conditions they bowled consistently but i dont think they will get such conditions in the coming matches

6081816 we are grateful to zimbabwe cricket for confirming the decision taken by its officials during annual conference week
6081817 this allows the icc the opportunity to plan with certainty the icc world twenty20 as well as giving scotland the side set to step up in zimbabwes place plenty of preparation time ahead of the tournament
6081818 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition
6081819 i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same

6081823 this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to have everyone who works in politics in one place
6081824 itll be a rare opportunity to have such hands on work between googlers and users
6081825 in terms of general interest around the election were only seeing it grow
6081826 the online component will hopefully make the convention a bit more personal and a bit more on demand
6081827 politics has been the top news category on yahoo news for six straight months so theres no question were seeing a strong interest in it
6081828 yahoo is in a much different position to provide deeper coverage of the convention than we were four years ago
6081829 these are partnerships we didnt have and we werent getting the video coverage like this four years ago
6081830 we do consider our technical support and expertise were providing to the conventions our first priority in helping them put on a first rate convention
6081831 we are excited to work with enterprise systems in bringing this critical enabler for vdi implementations to the market
6081832 itll be a little different coming to a place ive never seen before a course where i didnt win last year
6081833 itll be kind of weird that its not the course where i won
6081834 its not like i win every other week out here
6081835 ive only had four wins in 15 years for me theyre a special occasion
6081836 i was trying to do my best for the crowd it makes me happy so happy i felt that i could not go out without the world record because of the support the crowd gave me i remember my feelings from athens and i wanted to feel that again
6081837 you can set russias recent invasion of georgia and israels concern over irans nuclear aspirations on the back burner not that these topics lack importance
6081838 the stage is not adequately set for the highly publicized ezekiel 38 and 39 russian iranian nuclear equipped consortia of nations to invade israel psalm 83 comes first and then ezekiel 38 follows on its heels like a goliath shadow there are two distinct invasions of israel one building upon the other with both occurring sequentially in the middle east

6081928 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6081929 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6081930 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6081931 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6081932 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board
6081933 era a terceira vez que aquele substantivo e aquele artigo se encontravam no elevador um substantivo masculino com aspecto plural e alguns anos bem vividos pelas preposi es da vida o artigo era bem definido feminino singular ela era ainda novinha mas com um maravilhoso predicado nominal
6081934 all the negative attacks from the mccain campaign seem to have been paying off
6081935 in every election its kind of like the worse of two
6081936 when only one nuclear bomb could destroy a city like minneapolis
6081937 senator mccain its time to get serious about reducing the nuclear threat
6081938 out of an abundance of respect for both parties we will not allow attack ads of either persuasion to be prominently displayed in our concourses our customers and employees complained and we responded we will not be a party to petty political attacks on either side
6081939 nuclear weapons are scary and thats why we need to pay attention to them
6081940 but to say that the billboard is anti mccain is ludicrous in fact both mccain and obama largely agree with us that we need to rid the world of nuclear weapons these are not attack ads they are a strong reminder to both candidates that this is a very serious issue they need to address northwest airlines is trying to censor free speech and i dont think thats their role
6081941 the cold war ended nearly 20 years ago but the united states and russia still have many thousands of nuclear weapons and each keeps more than a thousand on hair trigger alert ready to be launched within a matter of minutes
6081942 this creates a real risk of an accidental or unauthorized russian launch against one or more american cities we need a public debate about u s nuclear weapons policy and thats why we launched our media campaign
6081943 toward true security ten steps the next president should take to transform u s nuclear weapons policy
6081944 sparks and syncoms new support along with this renewed support from our existing partners assures that clear will now be able to proceed to complete the clear national network and then expand to other non airport venues
6081945 this marks an exciting new phase in clears growth and in the development of the voluntary credentialing industry
6081946 with clear now accepted in 18 airports the company has already built the largest airport security fast pass business and it is well on its way to providing the nations travelers the best most effective way to get easy access to their flights
6081947 clears fast growth with their security verification system will continue to change the way people think about identity credentialing and fast access to venues with security bottlenecks ranging from airports to sports and concert arenas and beyond we are excited to work with steven brill and his team as they continue to build on their market momentum
6081948 syncom is delighted to partner with clear a business that is at the forefront of an exploding market opportunity in voluntary credentialing
6081949 the pika is the american wests canary in the coal mine
6081950 as temperatures rise pika populations at lower elevations are being driven to extinction pushing pikas further upslope until they have nowhere left to go
6081951 climate change is likely to drive a third of the worlds species to extinction worse its the species living on mountaintops which until now have been free from human impact that will be hardest hit
6081952 the american pika is an obvious example of such a species at considerable risk from climate change
6081953 not in the purview of the commission or department to effect
6081954 the california fish and game commissions attempt to bury its head in the sand rather than deal with the impact of global warming on wildlife is an embarrassment to our state which is a leader in climate policy
6081955 the commission is not allowed to abdicate its duty to protect californias plants animals and wild habitats and neither is the u s fish and wildlife service
6081956 this is just the latest in a long line of problems that have plagued the construction of this nuclear power plant
6081957 last week leaked documents showed that basic safety procedures were not being followed now we learn that bouyques has banned their employees from reporting their concerns about safety problems to the outside world and even to the finnish buyer of the plant tvo employees violating this ban have received official warnings and at least in one case even been fired on top of this areva does not allow any information about the nuclear project to travel outside the construction site the nuclear giant clearly hopes this misguided tactic will divert the worlds attention from the project but they are wrong greenpeace demands an immediate end to all construction work and an independent group of inspectors to be brought in
6081958 the commercial church the new face of religion in america
6081959 what we see in many emergency rooms are symptoms of problems that afflict the health care system as a whole and affect everyone
6081960 if we want to reduce unnecessary use of emergency departments we need to reassess patients ability to find primary care providers and be treated in a timely fashion
6081961 only half of california doctors participate in medi cal which means access is more difficult and an emergency room visit is more likely for these patients
6081962 weve always believed that even the most advanced cell phone is only as good as the network it runs on

6081964 i am designating the los angeles and santa cruz rivers as special cases and therefore epa headquarters will make the final determination of their jurisdictional status under the cwa clean water act
6081965 it is refreshing to see epa show some spine on a politically charged pollution issue
6081966 the reverberations from this action extend beyond these two rivers across the west
6081967 cleaning up the clean water act will be high on the agenda of the next congress
6081968 langage de programmation avec le site le plus moche du monde
6081969 in addition increases in the frequency of spanking are associated with increased odds of abuse and mothers who report spanking on the buttocks with an object
6081970 this study demonstrated for the first time that parents who report spanking children with an object and parents who frequently spank children are much more likely to report other harsh punishment acts consistent with physical abuse
6081971 striking a child with an object is unacceptable and may be dangerous
6081972 a violent education corporal punishment of children in us public schools
6081973 every public school needs effective methods of discipline but beating kids teaches violence and it doesnt stop bad behavior
6081974 corporal punishment discourages learning fails to deter future misbehavior and at times even provokes it
6081975 minority students in public schools already face barriers to success
6081976 by exposing these children to disproportionate rates of corporal punishment schools create a hostile environment in which these students may struggle even more
6081977 he took me into the office and gave me three licks he made me hold onto the wall and he paddled me it hurt for about two hours it felt like fire under my butt
6081978 the other kids were watching and laughing it made me want to fight them when you get a paddling and you see everyone laugh at you it make you mad and you want to do something about it
6081979 what made me so angry hes three years old he was petrified he didnt want to go back to school and he didnt want to start his new school i was so worried that this was going to constantly be with him equating going to school with being paddled
6081980 i went into the principals office he gave me a chair and said hold onto the chair the paddle had holes in it then he just did three swats i was hit on my buttocks there were holes in the paddle to make it go faster it hurt very much there were definitely red marks and then swelling almost welt like markings it didnt last for more than a couple days it left me feeling very humiliated i think there were several levels of emotion physical pain mental humiliation and being a female at that age it was like there was this older man hitting me on the butt thats weird even at that age i knew it was inappropriate
6081981 ive heard this said at my school and at other schools this child should get less whips itll leave marks students that are dark skinned it takes more to let their skin be bruised even with all black students there is an imbalance darker skinned students get worse punishment
6081982 i see corporal punishment as a form of slavery beating on the slaves was how the headman got them to do something were focused so much on making kids do what we want think about the mental capacity that this kind of treatment leaves our children with we are telling them we dont respect them they leave that principals office and they think they dont consider me a human being that young person loses self respect
6081983 there is enough concern now that the local politicians have most of them were enthusiastic in their support a year ago now they either have become neutral or have come out against most recently and said they do oppose it because they feel their questions have not been answered thoroughly
6081984 they were expecting to see more definitive information related to their concerns
6081985 from their perspective the eis didnt address the concerns to the degree that they were hoping for
6081986 you cant always get what you want business ideas slosh through my head like water in a washing machine and the path is quietly revealing itself as time wears on and smells really clean
6081987 i think maybe both is happening at the same time
6081988 it doesnt take a lot of courage to go to martinsville to talk about trade
6081989 on balance picking someone from virginia will be a net benefit to the ticket
6081990 its hard to see how hed bring strength to the ticket in the national security area
6081991 it is really not just a historic occasion but an extraordinary one
6081992 our countries poland and the united states will be more secure
6081993 were talking about a missile defense system that couldnt possibly be aimed at the russian nuclear deterrent
6081994 russia has thousands of nuclear warheads this is for small missile attacks of the kind that iran might launch
6081995 when the smoke has cleared after the battle we will stay neighbours
6081996 committed to the security of poland and any us facilities on the territory of poland
6081997 by accelerating our enterprise growth and executing well across the portfolio hp delivered a strong third quarter performance

6082000 there are no safety implications it is a question of dealing with minor issues before they become serious
6082001 one of the reactors was shut down as standard procedure but repairs to the plugs took longer than originally thought
6082002 the other was then shut down to enable work to be carried out on the supports
6082003 it is unusual for both reactors to be shut down at the same time and no electricity to be generated at all
6082004 we have no electricity being produced and we also have to pay for the repair work
6082005 also we have contracts with customers to supply power and so we have to buy supplies in and we are charged a premium rate
6082006 we cannot say when the reactors will be back online but its fair to say shortly i think we are on the home strait
6082007 new zealand has not arrived at a final position on this
6082008 but like a number of countries we do have reservations about aspects of the content of the draft exemption recently circulated to the nsg
6082009 we dont agree with either indias testing of nuclear weapons or its continued possession of those weapons

6082013 i was paying 2000 a month i would take care of all his medical issues expenses extracurricular activities anything to do with my son and that was the agreement and i never missed a payment
6082014 i pay it through the georgia department of resources office of child support services
6082015 my banker wires the funds to dhr they wire the funds right to her account however long that takes she needs to discuss that with them and not put me out there bad like that
6082016 we are going to find out if last weeks drop in gas supplies was an aberration because of the hurricane edouard
6082017 what we are seeing is a global slowdown in the economy and that is contributing to the weaker demand numbers that we have seen
6082018 that concept is starting to change these high prices are having an effect on global growth and it will slow down demand going forward
6082019 now people are looking at the market with more reality
6082020 already a firm favourite with the likes of high contrast
6082021 it was a nightmare actually something i dont like talking about really
6082022 but it was something ill never forget it was hard
6082023 it will be like that forever one side will not work but the other side will
6082024 but she can talk thats the main thing and she can sing as well
6082025 theirs is an operation that everyone will be studying for campaigns to come
6082026 obamas success online is as much about how our society has changed how our media ecology has changed just in the past four years
6082027 in one afternoon my dad is reaching friends who in the past would have taken him a whole year to be in contact with thats not necessarily obama thats the internet
6082028 but you have to give credit where credit is due obamas internet team is doing a hell of a job taking advantage of all these changes theyve basically leapfrogged not just the clinton and mccain campaigns but also the mainstream media when it comes to reaching their supporters
6082029 i like to say that we at the dean campaign were the wright brothers
6082030 this is not an extra chair this chair belongs to
6082031 early on we wanted to capture the sense that this campaign is not just about obama
6082032 i like how obama always says blacks whites spanish asian
6082033 he says all the races so you can see that hes not focused on one group of people
6082034 i guess ive kind of been rebelling from my cnn days where video had to be a certain length a certain format with a certain sensibility where i came from theres a lot of concern about ratings and about what they think people everyday people are interested in watching
6082035 here we dont worry about how many views our videos get thats not the priority one of our goals is to get people talking about whats going on in their lives and why theyre supporting barack and hopefully not only will they watch the videos but also comment on them and forward them to relatives and friends and co workers
6082036 but i have about eight strong volunteers probably closer to 10 strong volunteers
6082037 we dont have control over what people think of the videos we just put them out there
6082038 to me texting is the most personal form of communication
6082039 your phone is with you almost all the time youre texting with your girlfriend youre texting with your friends now youre texting with barack
6082040 watch barack debate tonight live on cnn 7pm edt reply back with your name and your thoughts during amp after the debate
6082041 please reply to this message with your five digit zip code to receive local obama campaign news and periodic updates
6082042 south carolina was a defining moment in what we were going to do with text messaging not just with young voters but with all voters
6082043 help barack get out the vote in pennsylvania if you can get to pa between now and 4 22 reply to this msg tvl and your name ex tvl ann please fwd msg
6082044 some people only go to myspace its where theyre on all day some only go to linkedin our goal is to make sure that each supporter online regardless of where they are has a connection with obama
6082045 then as much as we can we try to drive everyone to our site
6082046 as great as barack is if the campaign hadnt been constituted in this idea of investing in our everyday supporters and helping them organize among themselves i wouldnt have been as excited about the job
6082047 making sure the events are happening as planned that the hosts have resources that they count how many people actually show up
6082048 we were able to build a state by state organization during the primaries because of the internet
6082049 now we have to continue building on that in addition to making sure we keep getting our message across and asking our supporters to help us debunk any rumors and lies out there
6082050 that way women are calling other women people who list the environment as their top concern reach out to people who do too
6082051 i wanted to be a part of the campaign instead of just writing about it
6082052 you can see the main difference between the obama and mccain campaigns by going to their web sites
6082053 go to mccains pretty standard looks fine but go to obamas at the very top theres a quote
6082054 im asking you to believe not just in my ability to bring about real change in washington im asking you to believe in yours
6082055 because of the internet obama has built a movement hes leading a cause mccain is running on his r sum hes leading a campaign
6082056 now whats going to win a cause or a campaign we dont know
6082057 em cujo apartamento aconteciam os principais encontros da bossa nova
6082058 this is the definitive expression of the partnership between aston martin and jaeger lecoultre im delighted that we have been able to premiere this technology in such an elegant solution it is the first time horology and automotive engineering have been combined in this way
6082059 no no you misunderstood me i said there is a tiny pianist in the box
6082060 well uh you know i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or uh a scientific perspective uh answering that question with specificity uh you know is is uh above my pay grade
6082061 in relation to foreigners holding demonstrations in beijing in support of tibet independence competent authorities have the right to handle these things according to law
6082062 id also like to emphasize that in china activities that support tibet independence will be strongly condemned by the chinese people and will not be welcomed
6082063 im afraid my wife isnt safe we think the olympics should be held but i am just not in the mood to watch it
6082064 in china as in other countries applications for demonstrations must go through legal procedures
6082065 they wanted to see us stuck in jail so the olympics would look better
6082066 this contract is a major milestone in constructing the port in an economic climate where the building industry is experiencing a sharp slow down this is great news for essex and the uk in general
6082067 london gateway is vitally important for todays uk economy it will deliver the most efficient and technologically advanced port in the world and much needed deep sea capacity for the uk

6082070 this is not an extra chair this chair belongs to
6082071 on august 16 the freezer containing the alleged corpse arrived with the searching for bigfoot team
6082072 the ice was being thawed slowly and the following day we were up early to discover that some hair was now exposed i extracted some from the alleged corpse examined it and had some concerns
6082073 within the next hour of thaw a break appeared up near the feet area
6082074 as the team and i began examining this area near the feet i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
6082075 later that day we were informed that mr whitton and mr dyer had admitted it was a costume
6082076 it is nice to realize that you can compete against your own wife
6082077 how much has the sharemarket actually risen if you take out the dishonest largesse appropriated by those in the know
6082078 our investment is at an equity level in the listed entity in the longer term one of our aspirations is to have our foot on our own equity gas production at the asset level rather than through a company
6082079 i hope that australias increasingly important role as a supplier of clean energy resources such as lng uranium and renewable technologies will also be part of our ongoing discussions
6082080 the chinese market is incredibly important for the australian economy
6082081 in 2007 the chinese visitors contributed almost 9 of australias total inbound economic value spending approximately 2 billion this was an increase of 16 on 2006
6082082 everyone seems to be piling back into the resource stocks which are up about 3 7
6082083 it has gained a little bit more than it lost yesterday when it was down 2 7
6082084 theres an appetite out there to invest somewhere but no one is sure where to invest local financial stocks were down in early trade but started to rally towards the end
6082085 quite honestly its a tough market but the business did run well
6082086 the use of jargon is most common in people with a type a personality
6082087 the type a person is a quick thinker however they can be anxiety driven
6082088 overall were confident that the full year growth will be faster than the first half
6082089 the economic environment is uncertain and a changing competitive dynamic in the paint sector in australia will be further compounded by the introduction of imported paint by a major corporate retailer
6082090 a below theoretical win rate to the house of 1 27 which generated a negative impact of 6 5 million

6082093 these dudes will work for nothing and you can feed them an egg
6082094 as it actually is not as many americans imagine it to be
6082095 china is frequently cited as an example of the ills of globalisation
6082096 considering we tried to sell bejeweled outright to more than one industry giant back in the early days of our company and got no takers even after reducing our asking price to 60 000 this little game has done all right for itself
6082097 i vividly recall prospective buyers telling us its not even a game while showing us the door
6082098 considering we tried to sell bejeweled outright to more than one industry giant back in the early days of our company and got no takers even after reducing our asking price to 60 000 this little game has done all right for itself

6082100 we are making hundreds of millions of people worse off with biofuels because its pushing up food prices
6082101 conclusion is based on several critical errors in their analysis that when corrected lead to the exact opposite conclusion
6082102 biodiesel actually provides much more energy than is consumed in its production
6082103 the beef n cheddar marked a major milestone for arbys in 1978 and it continues to be a favourite even today
6082104 we want to thank our loyal customers for making the beef n cheddar a star on the arbys menu by offering it for just 30 cents less than what it originally cost 30 years ago
6082105 ninety per cent of the work is convincing people that the eyes are real
6082106 the subtlety of the timing of eye movements is a big one people also have a natural asymmetry for instance in the muscles in the side of their face those types of imperfections arent that significant but they are what makes people look real
6082107 theres always been control systems for different facial movements but say in the past you had a dial for controlling whether an eye was open or closed and in one frame you set the eye at 3 4 open the next 1 2 open etc this is like achieving that degree of control with much finer movements
6082108 for instance you could be controlling the movement in the top 3 4mm of the right side of the smile
6082109 there came a point where animators were trying to create a face and there was a theory of diminishing returns
6082110 if youre trying to process the graphics in a photo realistic animation in real time theres a lot of computation involved
6082111 within 24 hours of their arrival that they were here and staying with lee rohn
6082112 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defense site here in poland that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missiles from countries like iran or north korea
6082113 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6082114 it is a cause for regret that at a time when we are already in a difficult situation the american side further exacerbates the situation in relations between the united states and russia
6082115 the presence of the patriot battery which will defend our territory and the u s installation is a practical dimension of this watershed agreement
6082116 for poland and the united states this is just one more example of the deepening of our relations over the last 20 years
6082117 the increase in unemployment in the second quarter shows that the crisis in the economy is continuing as the figures are higher than in the first quarter of the year

6082119 sinn f in and others continuously warned the government that the over reliance on the construction sector and the property market was foolish
6082120 the government ignored all the warning signs that the economy was heading for a slowdown and failed to prepare for the recession even though all the economic indicators pointed to such an inevitability
6082121 rounded domes of light colored navaho sandstone tower over my head as i follow the gentle meanders of pleasant creek reflections of color from the sun drenched sandstone walls flow over rounded boulders in the creek as i walk through the cool shallow water i feel the gentle force of the current pushing me along tall sturdy cottonwoods lean over the banks of the creek and reach toward the water the sound of the water is everywhere like music this hike seems to possess a continuous unified and evocative composition a total integration of sensory information the melody harmony rhythm and timbre of this land stabs at my heart i am propelled forward by the natural beauty of this place a place so unique in erosional design and form that my mind struggles to fully grasp its meaning
6082122 meaning in a pile of rock am i fooling myself no such perfection in design is no accident such precise interplay of light color and form can be no accident artists struggle to capture that which already exists they attempt to imitate supplement alter or counteract the splendid work of nature some may come close through words colors or sounds but what can ever touch the true esthetic perfection of this land
6082123 the similarities are astounding there is harmony of all elements and coordination on a truly grand scale i see a supreme expression of art which easily stirs the emotions limitless diversity results in a striking contrast of textures from smooth free flowing contours to thunderous crescendos i often ride an emotional roller coaster of wild and chaotic tempos completely at the will of the creator yet often beneath the surface lies a haunting melody which permeates the very foundation of the whole
6082124 i arrived at 3 30 and by 6 30 was about 12 people away from the front the police cut the line around 5p and said everyone on line at that point would be served at 7 the police came out and said they were done serving that it wasnt the owners fault the chefs refused to cook past 7 and the chefs work for who exactly people were understandably upset since we were led to believe that if we were on the line by the cut off we would be served it was pretty cowardly of management to send the police to tell us it was over and i feel patsys management handled this very badly

6082139 we also expect to launch the southern african regional early childhood development forum finally symposium proceedings will be published for a wider national and regional audience

6082147 messages such as those sent by dowle could never be part of a therapeutic nurse patient relationship he has failed to act in a way that justifies the trust and confidence the public must have in a nurse
6082148 we consider this a very serious departure from the professional standards expected of a nurse towards a vulnerable female patient in the care of a mental health trust he failed to observe the boundaries that must exist between nurse and patient to a very significant extent

6082151 there is always this fear in hollywood that oh characters need to be likable and relatable and i dont know if thats necessarily the case i think that characters need to be human and they need to be recognizable but they dont have to necessarily be likable
6082152 that opens a whole world of comic possibilities i enjoy playing essentially unlikable characters and really committing to it and digging in

6082165 si no reaccionem ens trobarem amb una nova aena l nica novetat de la qual sigui una partici privada que no aporta res de nou i per contra que el paper de la generalitat de catalunya i de les ccaa sigui francament rid cul per no dir vergonyant
6082166 si es vol seguir el model socialista que no respecta els acords del parlament de catalunya i no permet que els aeroports de girona reus i sabadell siguin traspassats a la generalitat o si els socialistes admetran que han de presentar un model que vagi m s enll daquest 30 de participaci privada daquest 19 que com a molt poden tenir les ccaa i que no permet la participaci dajuntaments i cambres de comer

6082188 cardiac arrest and stroke are the leading causes of adult disability and alaskas arctic ground squirrel may lead to improved therapies for patients

6082197 we welcome many of the reports recommendations believe and truly believe that this consultation document is a timely contribution to the debate about the future of maternity services in the east of england the college agrees with the premise that healthcare in the region needs to change and nowhere is this more relevant than in relation to maternity and newborn care
6082198 faced with a rising birth rate and an increase in more complex births it is a gross understatement to say that 160 midwives are needed with an emerging baby boom we need at a conservative estimate at least 610 more midwives in the region
6082199 we welcomed many of the reports other recommendations and proposals such as for postnatal services but some of the proposals are vague and further consideration is needed in respect of the level of support given to women and their families
6082200 how can we expect midwives to cope when we are in the midst of a baby boom and their workload is racing ahead of staff numbers
6082201 the government in february has made a commitment to providing 4 000 new midwives the equivalent of 3 400 full time midwives across the country by 2012 we also need trusts in the region to make maternity services a priority so that mothers and babies get the service they need and deserve morale among midwives is low we want to see midwives valued and cherished and rewarded in their pay packet for their skill and dedication the challenge for the trusts in this region is to make maternity services a priority and show that maternity services really do matter

6082206 astrocyte polarization as opposed to hypertrophy may be due to the fact that t cells engage in a very focused attack and the astrocytes respond in a directed polarized manner we know that the astrocytes respond in this polarized manner but we are continuing to investigate precisely why
6082207 we believe this is part of a defensive astrocyte response that may serve to destroy the attacking t cells
6082208 when a t cell recognizes an astrocyte infected with a virus or identified as a foreign cell it launches an attack in response the astrocyte polarizes toward the t cell and may actually end up engulfing the aggressor if so this could be a novel unique mechanism of defense by brain cells against immune cells
6082209 t cells immunological synapses induce polarization of brain astrocytes in vivo and in vitro a novel astrocyte response mechanism to cellular injury
6082210 typically when neuropsychological tests are used for diagnostic purposes an individuals level of performance on specific tests is measured against healthy individuals to determine cognitive impairment
6082211 however this approach does not take into account intraindividual variability in cognitive function
6082212 we know that level of performance on tests of memory attention and executive function predicts dementia however this study showed for the first time that the degree of variability in performance across neuropsychological tests measured within a person improved the prediction of dementia above and beyond ones level of performance on each test alone
6082213 of the 897 participants there were 61 cases of dementia 6 8 percent identified during the follow up period which on average was 3 3 years
6082214 this figure is in line with what wed expect for the incidence of dementia in this population

6082234 using niquitin when i was quitting was a massive help and im not sure if i would have come this far if it wasnt for the lozenges i quit with a mate who offered me huge support but combined with the lozenges its got to improve your chances of quitting successfully and for good popping one of these in my mouth when i get that urge for a cigarette takes away my craving and puts my mind on something else which is very important

6082259 i would anticipate there is about 500 000 in property that we will never collect tax on
6082260 i dont want to give the impression that there is 1 5 million out there thats not the case
6082261 at least on a one time basis we will collect 500 000
6082262 while actual appearances and trial on a tax title petition are minimal tracking and due diligence on each of the filed cases will yield prompt and effective results to the town and the taxpayer
6082263 our intention is not to take possession of property and sell it
6082264 we already pay an extraordinary amount of money in attorney fees
6082265 we do not have a comparable figure that will inform us about another firms productivity
6082266 if we have hundreds of thousands in delinquent taxes i think this is critical
6082267 we dont know how they will perform unless we hire them
6082268 its the broadness of their portfolio and international mix that allows them to do better than rival msgs

6082270 the market has come to accept the fact that the government has got to do something
6082271 the biggest threat to the economy is the fragility in the financial system which stems largely from the deteriorating performance of residential real estate credit

6082291 this statement seems to show that cms is finally making the connection between its misguided directive and the real kids it could hurt
6082292 reality is the bush administration should not be applauded because nothing has changed
6082293 through this directive they are still committed to denying childrens access to health care
6082294 most states believe that if cms wants to make a change they should issue regulations or seek legislation
6082295 can be blamed on the passage of time more than anything
6082296 would have to either cover fewer children or raise more revenue perhaps by bumping up the tobacco tax increase that it already proposes
6082297 given how delicate the balance between coverage and costs was in the existing bill such a move could cause problems

6082305 medicare web site is somewhat difficult for people to use
6082306 when e health tools are designed designers really have to think about a broad and inclusive group of users and what their needs and abilities are
6082307 we really have to think who we are designing these web sites for what their needs are and what their capabilities are
6082308 we cant assume that everyone has a sophisticated level of computer skills
6082309 without that information we question the usefulness of the study
6082310 cms has worked to organize and format these tools in a consumer friendly manner by conducting both qualitative and quantitative research of the web site tools with multiple audiences
6082311 the information gathered from testing is used to make improvements to the web site our research is ongoing and the web site continues to make enhancements on an incremental basis
6082312 it would be nice to have an administration more committed to people understanding what their rights are
6082313 the administration could provide better quality services with more accuracy
6082314 in fairness its also true that congress and the bush administration has made so much of medicare so complex that even folks with the best of intentions are going to be misdirecting consumers
6082315 its absolutely true that the complexity that president bush has brought to medicare during his two terms in office has been unfortunate
6082316 at this time there was an impression given to the intelligence community of get the job done regardless of the methods
6082317 violated or ignored the law over long periods of time and have advocated and defended their right to break the law
6082318 undertaken the secret surveillance of citizens on the basis of their political beliefs primarily through secret informants but also using other intrusive techniques such as wiretaps microphone bugs surreptitious mail opening and break ins
6082319 these findings provide further evidence that the health system is falling short of where it needs to be to ensure health and economic security
6082320 we need a new administration to make universal and affordable health insurance available
6082321 what is notable is how this is spreading up the income scale
6082322 even adults with insurance reported problems in getting needed care
6082323 even in 2007 when the economic slow down hadnt really taken hold you found that 29 percent of those with medical bill problems or accrued medical debt reported being unable to pay for basic necessities like food heat rent
6082324 we want to appeal to any passengers that were on the x84 service who joined it between leeds bus station and otley
6082325 ich m chte hier nur die cr me de la cr me der internationalen klassikszene
6082326 genau genommen ist faust ja keine oper sondern ein oratorium
6082327 es ist ein fantastisches werk das ich sehr liebe und das auch mit popul rer musik wie etwa dem mitrei enden rakoczy marsch aufwartet ich finde dass sich faust noch dazu in so hervorragender besetzung mit kurt streit in der titelpartie bestens f r eine er ffnung eignet
6082328 angesichts der inszenierungen die man heutzutage sieht sollte man opern in den n chsten jahren ohnehin nur konzertant auff hren
6082329 because chinese researchers receive much smaller paychecks than their western counterparts shanghai based wuxi is able to lower the cost of this research
6082330 we have often heard major western pharmaceutical companies complain of the extraordinary cost of discovering and developing drugs
6082331 more costly than the laboratory infrastructure is the burden of paying for armies of highly trained highly paid chemists researchers analysts and physicians wuxi has become the secret weapon of many big name global pharmaceutical companies
6082332 china educates tens of thousands of engineers chemists and technologists and outsourcing that expertise has become a growth industry wuxi became a leader in this trend in 2000 and has gone on to attract an impressive roster of clients
6082333 the firms senior management team consists of ph d s and mbas with experience in drug and medical device r amp d wuxi management has more than 200 patents pending or granted and has published more than 800 scientific publications
6082334 wuxis u s based facilities are all fda registered including a 63 000 square foot facility in st paul minnesota a 46 000 square foot testing facility in atlanta and a 75 000 square foot facility in philadelphia
6082335 wuxis china based operations provide services to more than 80 pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers including nine of the top ten pharmaceutical companies
6082336 each of wuxis top 10 customers over the last three years continues to be its customer today a fact that speaks well of the firms skill effciency and respect for intellectual property
6082337 for the first quarter of 2008 wuxi reported q1 revenues were 69 higher than revenues for the same quarter a year ago at 57 1 million the big winner was laboratory services a division that saw its revenues rise by 77 to 38 5 million
6082338 the shares have plummeted since the companys 2007 ipo along with a general retrenchment in the shanghai composite index which fell from unrealistic highs this made wuxis post ipo blues worse than usual additional pressure was added by rumors of an upcoming secondary offering
6082339 the company has delayed indefinitely plans for a secondary offering while world markets remain turbulent meanwhile with its heady increase in earnings wuxi is attractively valued with a pe multiple of 22 2 were calling this company a buy up to 20

6082341 sempre bom lembrar que a m postura pode ser adotada num sof ou mesmo na cama assistindo televis o ou dormindo sentado por exemplo o que tamb m provocar dores

6082344 dans le cadre de notre r le d ducateur la lutte contre lhomophobie est mon sens un enjeu essentiel
6082345 il nest pas garanti que tous nos professeurs ou tous nos encadrants sachent dire des choses utiles
6082346 nous pouvons videmment dans nos formations initiales sensibiliser les enseignants sur le fait que la lutte contre lhomophobie est un acte ducatif mais les conseiller sur les programmes je ne crois pas que cela soit possible
6082347 la solution passe par une personne r f rente les infirmi res font un tr s bon travail
6082348 football in the communities have a lot of courses going on throughout the year
6082349 its good to see so many young people enjoying football
6082350 im more than happy to spend the time talking to the kids about their game
6082351 youve got a lot of places around the planet where the only access to the digital content out there is through a notebook and a wireless card
6082352 of course military and technical cooperation is the main issue weapons purchases are very important
6082353 i think we should speed it up moreover the west and israel continue to put pressure on russia
6082354 on this issue we fully support russia georgia started this crisis but the west is blaming russia
6082355 the entire front line of the armys brass stepped down because of the war gal hirsch who was defeated in lebanon went to georgia and they too lost because of him
6082356 relying on israeli experts and weapons georgia learned why the israeli generals failed what happened in georgia is a message to all those the americans are seeking to entangle in dangerous adventures
6082357 parents need to be aware that a lot of the supplements for children contain only a very small number of vitamins
6082358 they look like sweets taste like sweets and in a sense they are sweets
6082359 grape antioxidant dietary fibre showed significant reducing effects in lipid profile and blood pressure
6082360 the effects appear to be higher than the ones caused by other dietary fibres such as oat fibre or psyllium probably due to the combined effect of dietary fibre and antioxidants
6082361 we believe that he should come clean and admit that he has misrepresented his vote in the past on this born alive infant protection act and that he should apologize to those that he has called liars
6082362 i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
6082363 i would have been completely in fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported which was to say that you should provide assistance to any infant that was born even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion that was not the bill that was presented at the state level
6082364 i think the american people need to know how extreme he is and the role that he played on this
6082365 the suggestion that obama the proud father of two little girls and others who opposed these bills supported infanticide is deeply offensive and insulting the bills senator obama voted against in illinois were crafted to undermine roe v wade or pre existing illinois state law
6082366 its basically a comet but it never gets close enough to the sun to develop a long bright tail of evaporated gas and dust
6082367 is the only place in the solar system that can produce these orbits efficiently
6082368 it could have formed like pluto in the belt of icy debris beyond neptune then been kicked to large distance by a gravitational encounter with neptune or uranus
6082369 however we think it is more probable that sq372 comes from the inner edge of the oort cloud
6082370 the release of terrorists and murderers without any return and the diplomatic amateurism of the olmert livni barak government
6082371 in the field of security what we see is one failure after another from the lebanon war through the agreements which followed the war through hizbullahs rearmament through the firing of rockets on our communities and of course through the tahadiya temporary ceasefire which allows hamas to continue arming itself now you can add the terrorists release to this ongoing failure
6082372 after picking the fruits of the growth we brought the government is about to lose it the tsunami is on its way this is bad news for israels economy security cannot be established without economy
6082373 ive heard of a memory of a fish but netanyahu thinks the people have a memory of only a few seconds
6082374 some 200 terrorists were releases two of them with blood on their hands unfortunately we have gotten used to terror organizations kidnapping soldiers and they demand to release prisoners if we released 200 prisoners its certainly better than releasing them in exchange for the kidnapping of soldiers
6082375 we wont give this award to anyone who tries to abduct soldiers this government will do everything in order to prevent kidnappings we hope kidnapped soldier gilad shalit returns home we will have to pay there as well we are bolstering the pragmatists
6082376 i heard netanyahu and no one is taking his credit for leading the economy this government still maintains the line how can we face the global changes in economy
6082377 these are the pragmatic elements the israeli government is bolstering
6082378 this approach shows how students of all skill and ability levels can be exposed to and benefit from being physically active
6082379 we traverse the rock climbing wall play ping pong power walk and much more
6082380 this is a model of excellence that should be copied around the nation
6082381 collaborating with parents and community stakeholders is one of the most important aspects of promoting healthy living this ensures that healthy lifestyles arent just talked about while in school but are actually practiced at home and in the community
6082382 this program shows the full benefits that can be derived from increasing physical activity
6082383 the noise level is low making this the ideal time for teachers and students to build positive relationships
6082384 anyone who has visited a school cafeteria knows that the loud and rushed atmosphere isnt conducive to healthy eating good digestion or nutrition education
6082385 weve found that educating children about making healthy food choices has influenced the choices that are being made at home
6082386 with all of the influences students are exposed to ensuring good mental health should be a high priority for all schools
6082387 we dont serve dessert or fried food and we offer a wide range of fresh fruits and vegetables
6082388 excellent and at first difficult choices are being made about the foods served by the school
6082389 helping the chil dren set personal goals and giving them valuable feedback about their progress can be a great motivational tool
6082390 this integrated model and focus on real life problem solving are outstanding ways to teach healthy lifestyles
6082391 learning at an early age to be self sufficient and to take personal responsibility for your own health and life leads to solid decision making skills
6082392 i love the games contests and promotions we know that when kids are motivated they do their best work and that learning goes beyond simply preparing for the test this program is instilling values that will remain with these students for a lifetime
6082393 community partners other disciplines sports cooking i wish schools across the country would use this program
6082394 its wonderful to incorporate family teachers and students into the program
6082395 this provides a supportive environment in which everyone can work together encourage one another and enjoy family time while being physically active
6082396 they were nice but you could tell they wanted us to leave
6082397 we warn the enemy against continuing its policy if it continues with the insistence approach shalit will be considered a second ron arad
6082398 abbas and fayyad are not interested in seeing the palestinian resistance achieve an honorable deal as they do not believe in the way of the resistance they only believe in the road of negotiations and in pleading with the enemy and manage to release prisoners whose jail term was close to its end like in the recent list
6082399 oh i just dont really feel like drinking these days yknow
6082400 please congratulate me because i just found out that the only real reason i do it is for praise
6082401 as we drive along this road called life occasionally a gal will find herself a little lost and when that happens i guess she has to let go of the coulda shoulda woulda buckle up and just keep going
6082402 as we speed along this endless road to the destination called who we hope to be i cant help but whine are we there yet
6082403 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6082404 i live like a recluse no one knows i exist
6082405 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
6082406 it was very brief we spoke for just a few minutes it was like meeting a complete stranger
6082407 huruma is a tough place last january during the elections there was rioting and six people were hacked to death the police dont even arrest you they just shoot you
6082408 although we clearly face more challenging macro economic conditions in fiscal 2009 the 12 months between 30 june 2008 and 30 june 2009 were well positioned to deliver continued if somewhat less robust growth
6082409 we realise that carols shoes are extremely difficult ones to fill as she has done such an amazing job on countdown over the past 25 years
6082410 however just as we found carol through an ad in a local paper we really hope we can do the same again and find another outstanding mathematical mastermind we know many countdown viewers have great heads for numbers so we are looking forward to seeing how talented they really are
6082411 we received a personal request in the matter from the king who is one of my friends this move was considered very carefully we are not releasing these prisoners we are remanding them to a jordanian prison for the rest of their sentence
6082412 we are re editing our film and are seeking permission from the bbc to incorporate current beijing footage into the 24 august edit

6082416 weve got to produce our own oil and gas right here in our country
6082417 sharp turnarounds for a man who has made the expansion of renewable energy a cornerstone of his career
6082418 a clear shift from his previous opposition to such measures
6082419 not every place that can support oil drilling should be drilled
6082420 egs enhanced geothermal systems could be the killer app of the energy world it has the potential to deliver vast quantities of power 24 7 and be captured nearly anywhere on the planet and it would be a perfect complement to intermittent sources like solar and wind
6082421 could conceivably be deployed almost anywhere and is essentially limitless in supply
6082422 there is no way that we can change the energy resources in our society without real leadership from the government
6082423 the current administration its sad to say has not provided that leadership
6082424 the government will really have to prime the pump for this to work
6082425 if you have a good idea its much better to share that widely and allow your suppliers to reach economies of scale by selling to others
6082426 but you need a level playing field compared to the people who pick germany or malaysia as their home
6082427 lets film every last thing written by philip k dick
6082428 most of the worlds transboundary river basins lack adequate legal protection
6082429 this essential treaty has languished in limbo for more than a decade largely due to the failure of nations in not signing up to what they long ago agreed to
6082430 because most of the worlds transboundary river basins lack adequate legal protection the world needs a global framework for sustainably managing and preventing disputes over those resources
6082431 this is the only such framework available in the timescale to help us deal with a growing water crisis
6082432 behind the world food crisis is a global freshwater crisis expected to rapidly worsen as climate change impacts intensify

6082434 the proposed development would provide a new use for a site which is currently vacant and detracts visually from the area

6082439 o boavista vai apresentar se em todos os campos para tentar ganhar
6082440 jogar no boavista tem que significar algo para os jogadores
6082441 o boavista uma marca que vende e conhecida na europa o boavista n o um clube de coitadinhos

6082444 i was bizarrely visible people would yell at me as if there was a light shining on my head the minute i wrapped i came home and dyed it back to red i was more strongly identified with my hair colour than i thought
6082445 i didnt really want to lead but i didnt go off like a hare and managed to control the pace so that i was ready to respond when those behind me sped up
6082446 i came through well even though i dont feel fantastic after my recent illness and the nerves will be gone in the semi finals i just hope to wake up 100 for those tomorrow
6082447 the change will not affect existing customers and new customers can still claim 12 months backdating if they apply before october 6 the changes are part of a wider package of measures to make claiming benefits simpler and more automatic and increase take up
6082448 i think on balance this represents a good package it is a trade off that is worth having
6082449 while progress has been made there is no doubt that we need to move forward quickly
6082450 the political process has suffered major delays and is far from where it should be
6082451 i dont see that 2050 goal as very helpful since its so far away
6082452 a 2050 signal is okay but doesnt give us a real basis for agreeing
6082453 great land grab threat at u n climate talks in ghana
6082454 when it comes to producing clean power were determined to make new york the no 1 city in the nation
6082455 we dont think of alternative power as something that we just import from other parts of the nation
6082456 we want their best ideas for creating both small and large scale projects serving new yorkers
6082457 if rooftop wind can make it anywhere this is a great city
6082458 pretty much the same level of difficulty as drilling an oil rig but you dont have to pump oil
6082459 you could imagine going as much as 15 20 25 miles offshore where its virtually invisible to land
6082460 nobody is going to see a wind farm off the coast of queens in the next year
6082461 the idea of renewable power in and around new york city is very realistic
6082462 the question is what type makes the most sense and in what time frame that is what we are trying to figure out
6082463 i dont worry about what people say the trends are i like to be different
6082464 ive not really had a whole lot to say to tell you the truth
6082465 as to when ill be back on the practice field thats still to be determined obviously the sooner the better for me my goal is to be back for the first game

6082467 we are not seeing any trends towards driving prices downwards there is however uncertainty about when the macro environment will turn around
6082468 tom was clinging to katie which is no surprise shes been his rock these past few months
6082469 he can no longer command top fees for his movies as his name isnt a guarantee of box office success any more and thats hit his confidence hard
6082470 so much so that he even considered giving up acting at one point
6082471 at the premiere they seemed mismatched katie looked every inch the glamorous starlet while tom looked needy diminished and much older
6082472 the highest levels of repayments seen in the last six years
6082473 this is extremely bad news for consumers who may be considering consolidating existing debts to try to drive down their monthly expenditure

6082546 the way mr zardari handled the issue of presidents resignation with wisdom is really admirable
6082547 the mqm has played a vital wild card today by announcing the name of zardari so early in the game
6082548 we thought musharrafs resignation will bring stability and calm but it looks like the turf battle between the coalition partners will set towards another era of instability

6082551 de trabajadora sexual o de monja yo decido el vestido

6082555 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6082556 we have held talks with the chinese for a year and the terms of the deal were changed to a service contract the chinese have agreed on that with a value of 1 2 billion
6082557 ballack ist nicht mehr unumstritten sein f hrungsstil wurde von teamkollegen als despotisch empfunden vor allem erfahrene mitspieler bem ngeln dass er sich w hrend der em nicht solidarisch verhalten habe und dass er seine sonderstellung die ihm als star und kapit n zugestanden wird nicht durch besondere leistungen best tigt habe
6082558 einige spieler waren bei der wm und in der em qualifikation sehr stark
6082559 aber es dr ngen junge spieler nach und es z hlt die leistung jetzt
6082560 bersetzt hei t das erstens ballack und frings beide bald 32 jahre alt waren bei der em selber nicht sehr stark und zweitens das leistungsprinzip das l w in einzelf llen durch das prinzip erfahrung aufgeweicht hatte wird wieder konsequenter angewandt
6082561 frings und ballack einst als kraftzentrum des deutschen spiels international ger hmt sind nicht mehr unanfechtbar
6082562 es tut sich was in einer mannschaft die bei der em noch stark bestimmt war von jenen profis die seit jahren das profil des teams gepr gt haben
6082563 jetzt gibt es einen neuen abschnitt und der l uft nach dem leistungsprinzip
6082564 ballack und frings sind zwei starke spieler die es zu verdr ngen gilt ich habe von beiden viel gelernt aber ich m chte sie eines tages abl sen
6082565 l w wird verd chtigt die wortwahl zuvor mit hitzlsperger und simon rolfes zumindest in teilen abgesprochen zu haben
6082566 eine verr ckte szene die ich leider noch ein paar mal im fernsehen gesehen habe es kann in so einer situation passieren dass man den ball nicht richtig trifft was nicht passieren darf ist dass man nicht nachsetzt und zum kopfball hochgeht da war ich zu perplex und habe gedacht jetzt treff ich das tor schon wieder nicht ich war verunsichert
6082567 das t rkische element im deutschen fu ball ist immer noch berschaubar anders als umgekehrt als die t rken 2002 dritter der weltmeisterschaft wurden waren die so genannten almancilar die deutschl nder bast rk davala und mansiz entscheidend an diesem erfolg beteiligt den kampf um die talente gibt es immer noch aber er wird nicht mehr so erbittert gef hrt beim dfb hei t es man akzeptiere wenn sich jugendliche f r die t rkei entschieden der verband kann sich das leisten in deutschland gebe es wieder so viele gut ausgebildete talente dass gar nicht alle f r deutschland spielen k nnten
6082568 dass der verband als nachfolger des gescheiterten trainers ren vandereycken niemanden anders als wieder vandereycken fand der eine neue chance erhielt sah nicht wie ein neuanfang aus vandereycken gilt als mann von gestern er pflegt einen eher defensiven langsamen fu ball der immer fter auch von den spielern selbst kritisiert wird
6082569 aquello que naci mediante mentiras y traici n oculto siempre termina pronto por el juicio del padre creador
6082570 of course military and technical cooperation is the main issue weapons purchases are very important
6082571 i think we should speed it up moreover the west and israel continue to put pressure on russia
6082572 on this issue we fully support russia georgia started this crisis but the west is blaming russia
6082573 the entire front line of the armys brass stepped down because of the war gal hirsch who was defeated in lebanon went to georgia and they too lost because of him
6082574 relying on israeli experts and weapons georgia learned why the israeli generals failed what happened in georgia is a message to all those the americans are seeking to entangle in dangerous adventures
6082575 i think that in russia and in the world everyone is now aware of israels role and its military consultants in the georgian crisis
6082576 and if before in russia there were people who thought these forces can be friendly then now i think no one thinks that way
6082577 30 seconds to mars non uno stupido progetto secondario che fa si che io mi finga un musicista e qualcosa che coinvoilge tutto il mio cuore e la mia anima
6082578 dans le cadre de notre r le d ducateur la lutte contre lhomophobie est mon sens un enjeu essentiel
6082579 il nest pas garanti que tous nos professeurs ou tous nos encadrants sachent dire des choses utiles
6082580 nous pouvons videmment dans nos formations initiales sensibiliser les enseignants sur le fait que la lutte contre lhomophobie est un acte ducatif mais les conseiller sur les programmes je ne crois pas que cela soit possible
6082581 la solution passe par une personne r f rente les infirmi res font un tr s bon travail
6082582 now the cement we produce will not make millionaires of some men far away and it will be used for our houses our infrastructure and our national development plan
6082583 the principles of dialogue nondiscriminatory treatment and in agreement with the applicable legal standards
6082584 while progress has been made there is no doubt that we need to move forward quickly
6082585 the political process has suffered major delays and is far from where it should be
6082586 i dont see that 2050 goal as very helpful since its so far away
6082587 a 2050 signal is okay but doesnt give us a real basis for agreeing
6082588 great land grab threat at u n climate talks in ghana
6082589 when it comes to producing clean power were determined to make new york the no 1 city in the nation
6082590 we dont think of alternative power as something that we just import from other parts of the nation
6082591 we want their best ideas for creating both small and large scale projects serving new yorkers
6082592 if rooftop wind can make it anywhere this is a great city
6082593 pretty much the same level of difficulty as drilling an oil rig but you dont have to pump oil
6082594 you could imagine going as much as 15 20 25 miles offshore where its virtually invisible to land
6082595 nobody is going to see a wind farm off the coast of queens in the next year
6082596 the idea of renewable power in and around new york city is very realistic
6082597 the question is what type makes the most sense and in what time frame that is what we are trying to figure out
6082598 there is no way that we can change the energy resources in our society without real leadership from the government
6082599 the current administration its sad to say has not provided that leadership
6082600 the government will really have to prime the pump for this to work
6082601 if you have a good idea its much better to share that widely and allow your suppliers to reach economies of scale by selling to others
6082602 but you need a level playing field compared to the people who pick germany or malaysia as their home
6082603 from over 300 nominations submitted by computer weekly readers our judging panel drew up across a range of categories
6082604 first mention must go to steve clayton whose blog geek in disguise having won first place in the company blogs category by popular vote was also named as the
6082605 egs enhanced geothermal systems could be the killer app of the energy world it has the potential to deliver vast quantities of power 24 7 and be captured nearly anywhere on the planet and it would be a perfect complement to intermittent sources like solar and wind
6082606 could conceivably be deployed almost anywhere and is essentially limitless in supply

6082612 let me see if i cant scarf that out of here
6082613 despite continued low levels of activity in the australian housing market borals australian ebitda was up 9 and accounted for approximately 96 of borals total fy 2008 earnings
6082614 ebitda from construction materials in australia was up 35 million to 489 million due to strength in non dwellings and infrastructure activity and price increases in most markets australian building products also delivered an improved result with ebitda up 17 million to 168 million with strong queensland and victorian housing markets offsetting a weaker western australia market and continued low levels of activity in new south wales
6082615 we expect that in australia we will see a further lift in construction materials earnings and building products will be broadly steady in the usa increased benefits from structured cost reduction programs will be delivered but we expect us earnings to decline further with housing starts of around 900 000 compared with 1 13 million in fy 2008 we expect continued competitive market conditions and input cost pressures in asia particularly in construction materials we will provide an update on trading conditions at the agm on 24 october 2008

6082629 the tower would appear disturbingly prominent or oppressive in scale
6082630 i got into a lot of fights for no reason
6082631 i just wanted the attention my younger brother and older brother always got the attention with me just being in the middle
6082632 it affected my education a lot because i was never in school i would be gone for 3 to 7 days for fighting
6082633 there are two sides of my family the church side and the family that was involved in gangs the church side would attempt to bring the gang related side and be involved with them but the other gang side thought they would try to convert them
6082634 at 14 is when i decided to turn my life around just before going to high school
6082635 i was always around the church side of my family without them in my life i dont know where i would be right now
6082636 the streets are pointless and will give you two things jail or six feet under
6082637 if you keep doing that its going to show on your record and you wont be where you want to be
6082638 i got into church big time when i stopped fighting and having a negative attitude
6082639 i can talk to dudley about anything girls school just everything
6082640 stay focused and go for you dreams dont let anything sway you and distract you
6082641 i can see a growth in him in terms of his dreams and his goals
6082642 yes i have a family now and yes i work two jobs and volunteer at a park to provide for my family
6082643 cela montre que les perspectives sam liorent pour ces femmes qui se trouvent d j au milieu de leur parcours professionnel
6082644 what do i want to be when i grow up
6082645 im not gonna say im never gonna do drugs again i just know im not a good person on drugs
6082646 it was the hardest thing for me when i realised i was pregnant and realised i wanted to have the baby i made a huge decision to make my life more stable
6082647 one thing i will say for you is that youve been the best head of house
6082648 tonight well celebrate passing the task ill try and get us a party and some food because weve got no dinner tonight
6082649 they are launching more complex attacks and have grown more assertive
6082650 this is a regional problem without political change in pakistan even 200 000 nato soldiers wont be enough
6082651 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
6082652 the only result of airstrikes is the killing of civilians
6082653 we do see evidence in the tactics and techniques used by the enemies in our sector indicating a foreign influence
6082654 that is why a strategy of counterinsurgency is necessary not only in afghanistan but throughout the region
6082655 reconstruction money has gone in the wrong pockets and ngos and government officials are seen as corrupt meaning some people in the provinces are turning to the taliban
6082656 the taliban controls the courts the police even the district government
6082657 i think that in back of my mind i was hoping that one day i would feel well enough to see if the place was here
6082658 im not looking to be a financial or grant administrator
6082659 the way you move you orient yourself around him without even thinking about it when he moves even a little bit you adjust your position at the same time like magnets or gravity youre like a satellite or something iv never seen anything like it
6082660 ill be back so soon you wont have time to miss me look after my heart ive left it with you
6082661 i know youre frustrated that hes keeping you locked up like this but dont give him too bad a time when he gets back he loves you more than you know it terrifies him to be away from you
6082662 just like the rest of us white skin gold eyes
6082663 hmmm youre quite adorable when youre jealous its surprisingly enjoyable
6082664 sleep my bella dream happy dreams you are the only one who has ever touched my heart it will always be yours sleep my only love
6082665 and the sound of your heart its the most significant sound in my world im so attuned to it now i swear i could pick it out from miles away but neither of these things matter this you thats what im keeping youll always be my bella youll just be a little more durable
6082666 edward theres no point to forever without you i wouldnt want on day without you
6082667 im not going to kill you now because it would upset bella but if you ever bring her back damaged again and i dont care whose fault it is i dont care if she merely trips or if a meteor falls out of the sky and hits her in the head if you return her to me in less than the perfect condition that i left her in you will be running with three legs do you understand that mongrel and if you ever kiss her again i will break your jaw for her
6082668 if thats what she wants then i wont object you might want to wait for her to say it rather than trust your interpretation of body language but its your face one more thing ill be fighting for her too you should know that im not taking anything for granted and ill be fighting twice as hard as you will she is mine
6082669 dont apologize never be afraid to tell me how you feel bella if this is what you need you are my first priority
6082670 it doesnt have to be a big production i dont need a fanfare you wont have to tell anyone or make any changes i just want it to be official that you belong to me and no one else
6082671 of course i am you dont have the faintest idea how much i wish i could do what youre doing for her mongrel
6082672 i have considered it in some ways you would be better suited for her than another human bella takes some looking after and youre strong enough that you could protect her from herself and from everything that conspires against her you have done that already and ill owe you for that as long as i live forever whichever comes first but im not stupid enough to make the same mistake i made before jacob i wont try to force her into that first option again as long as she wants me im here
6082673 the clouds i can handle but i cant fight with an eclipse
6082674 if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me
6082675 to the generation of their fathers where they shall never see light
6082676 what a cut must it be to the heart of that father whose sons life shall tell his conscience what a profane sons lips once told his father to his face
6082677 thou shalt beat him with a rod and shall deliver his soul from hell
6082678 0 cursed father oh cruel merciless mother whose examples have drawn me after you into all this you had time enough and motives enough to have warned me of this place and misery whilst my heart was tender and my affections pliable had it not been as easy to have put a bible as a play book before me to have chastised me when i provoked god by sin as when i provoke you about a trifle one word spoken in season might have saved my soul one reproof wisely given and set on by your example might have preserved me had it not been the same pains to have asked me child what wilt thou do to be saved as what wilt thou do to live in this world or had i but observed any serious religion in you had i but found or heard my father or mother upon their knees in prayer it might have awakened me to a consideration of my condition in my youth i was shame faced fearful credulous and apt to imitate had you but had wisdom as other parents have to have taken hold of any of these handles in time you had rescued my soul from hell nay so cruel have you been to your own child that you allowed me no time if i had had a disposition for any exercise of religion yea you had quenched and stifled the sparks of convictions and better inclinations that sometimes were in my heart o happy had it been if i had never been born of you or seen your faces
6082679 in whom was found some good thing towards the lord god of israel in the house of jeroboam
6082680 you must honor your parents but still you must prefer your god before them
6082681 i went by the field of the slothful and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding and lo it was all grown over with thorns and nettles had covered the face thereof and the stone wall thereof was broken down
6082682 i went by the field of the slothful and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding
6082683 i saw and considered it well i looked upon it and received instruction
6082684 it was all grown over with thorns and nettles had covered the face thereof
6082685 when i have a horse and a cow every man biddeth me good morrow
6082686 god will do his own work salvation is all of grace
6082687 that my mistress takes the sacrament for otherwise i should not know she had any religion at all
6082688 no i am not one of his disciples do not think so badly of him as to imagine that i can be one of them
6082689 i went by the field of the slothful and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding and lo it was all grown over with thorns and nettles had covered the face thereof
6082690 thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee
6082691 how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation
6082692 a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to sleep
6082693 i do not go into open sin i am moral
6082694 i told you what would happen you were afraid to prejudice your boy in the right way but the devil had no such qualms he has prejudiced him the other way and pretty strongly too
6082695 let us tread in our fathers footsteps for he was a happy and a holy man let us follow our mothers ways for she was sweetness itself
6082696 i went by the field of the sluggish church and it was all grown over with thorns and nettles and the stone wall was broken down so that one could scarcely tell which was the church and which was the world yet still she slept and slept and slept and nothing could waken her
6082697 tis even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight
6082698 yet a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to sleep
6082699 yes yes the far country is not a fit place for me i will not stay here long i mean to go home by and by
6082700 surely you do not object to my having a little more sleep
6082701 you have waked me so soon i only ask another little nap
6082702 it is rather late i know but it will not be much later if i take just another doze
6082703 it is the hottest part of the day i daresay if i had been up i should have gone to the sofa and taken a little rest from the hot sun
6082704 it is of no use to get up now for the day is almost over
6082705 i do not think it will matter much if i wait till the clock strikes i will rest another minute or two
6082706 and in hell he lift up his eyes being in torment

6082714 at the end of the day we are trying to reach the same goal
6082715 for self regulation to be sustainable brand owners must keep abreast of changes in community expectations by being actively engaged with key stakeholders such as the the environmental centre
6082716 advertisers must carefully consider their claims and the impression they are trying to convey and ensure that it is accurate and able to be substantiated the guidelines are helpful but the law boils down to whether the claims are true and whether they are likely to mislead
6082717 it was workshopped in advance it was designed to give telstra some traction in the telecommunications debate the remark did earn phil some critics and did in some peoples minds brand him as a buffoon but ultimately the comment achieved its desired effect he catapulted regulation from the business pages into the general news pages and attracted an audience that it wouldnt have attracted otherwise

6082736 i dont think were considered among the favorites for this race because therell probably be a lot of bunch sprints and only few opportunities for attacks i think that those teams with a strong time trial rider in the line up will try and keep the peloton together all the way to the final time trial and the same goes for the sprinter teams so we havent chosen a captain beforehand on the contrary this is a race where all our riders have a chance from the word go if you get the opportunity youve gotta grab it
6082737 lets wait and see as far as lars goes he crashed last week during the training camp and i dont actually know if hes one hundred percent but if he is hes definitely got a good chance in this race but were taking it one day at a time and hope to be able to create some action along the way and maybe stir things up a bit in order to create some variation
6082738 with haedo breschel and goss we should have a good chance in the sprints but there are other top sprinters in the race as well like daniele bennati liquigas and tom boonen quick step so itll be tough

6082761 in terms of general interest around the election were only seeing it grow
6082762 the online component will hopefully make the convention a bit more personal and a bit more on demand
6082763 politics has been the top news category on yahoo news for six straight months so theres no question were seeing a strong interest in it
6082764 yahoo is in a much different position to provide deeper coverage of the convention than we were four years ago
6082765 these are partnerships we didnt have and we werent getting the video coverage like this four years ago
6082766 we do consider our technical support and expertise were providing to the conventions our first priority in helping them put on a first rate convention

6082787 bush daddy has kept pestering me about the issue of living dismemberment probably thinking that this is what it means when psalm 53 5 says that god will scatter the bones of those camping against you bush daddy says this means that the limbs of the designated target will be duct taped and cut off each time the person revives another limb will be cut off and or shortened until he or she succumbs

6082905 we are not ready to enter the recording studio yet but what we got until now promises that the next album will be crushing and will definitely continue where tetra karcist stopped

6082915 since obama returned from his overseas trip it seems like mccain has thrown all the punches clearly the blows have landed in recent days obama is fighting back going after mccain on the economy the issue voters care about most mccain has changed the dynamic of the race heading into the two conventions that puts more pressure on obama to go to denver and effectively define himself and mccain

6082925 database archiving often fails to get the attention it needs compared to other critical activities related to production databases and data warehouses
6082926 an archival system becomes critical when you need to access archived information in response to a legal summons customer service issue security investigation or technical issue the value of archiving grows considerably as it becomes easier to access the archived data
6082927 with legal demands for access growing conventional approaches to database archiving are increasingly being found lacking they focus on lifting and shifting inactive data from production databases to improve application performance without considering how to optimize the way archived data is stored get your archiving right and you reduce storage costs and guarantee simple future proofed access get it wrong and at worst you could face prison
6082928 why database archiving should be part of your dbms strategy
6082929 it managers need to achieve a balance between the compliance demands for retention and the business demand for economical storage and retrieval current database management system technology is optimised for transactional processing data warehouses are optimised for analytics but both fail to adequately address archiving needs worse still the lines between archive stores and backup which have very different drivers and requirements are all too often blurred
6082930 forresters research clearly illustrates the need for the new generation of archive stores these deliver both massive reductions in storage footprints through data compression together with the security immutability and point in time query capability that enables quick simple and unimpeachable fulfilment of regulatory obligations

6082937 the ground seems to me to be shifting under the concept of privacy
6082938 i wrote a judgement a few years ago in which i said there seemed to me to be certain things that were self evidently private im not sure about that any more when you look at the kind of information people publish about themselves it makes you wonder
6082939 i used to think having a telephone conversation was normally private but you cant walk down the street without hearing phone conversations
6082940 the surplus that the rudd government put together is very important
6082941 its a buffer against international economic uncertainty and for the liberal party to try to blow a hole in that surplus is the height of economic irresponsibility
6082942 the liberal party needs to make a genuine attempt to reverse this insidious ongoing attempt to centralise more power including revenue raising power in canberra

6082973 is this delay so the parliamentary mandarins can press the mute button on any objectionable verbiage so it can be to use the title of the classic car movie gone in 60 seconds the victorian public is being led astray by being informed that this webcast is live when its a minute behind a minute is a long time in politics

6082979 i think there must be some other reason behind it if they are detained and educated for a year there must be some other reason behind it it cant just be because they are sending petitions to protest it is not possible for them to be detained thats my understanding

6083081 the coal river wind project is ambitious coal river mountain watch proposes to put 220 wind turbines each 292 feet high that combined could generate 440 megawatts across miles of the mountain at a cost of upward of 1 billion a study by windlogics appalachian voices and wind farm campaign coordinator rory mcilmoil 28 who has studied and analyzed wind energy for the past 16 months found that a wind farm could produce enough power for 150 000 homes more than the entire surrounding county has and create at least 200 jobs for the two year construction period and 40 to 50 permanent jobs to keep the turbines running underground mining according to the study would create at least another 200 direct mining jobs and potentially more if mountaintop removal were prevented given the current demand for coal from central appalachia the study acknowledges that while the four proposed mountain removal operation sites would generate far fewer jobs only an estimated 65 to 225 per year depending on how long the four permit areas were mined they would generate much more power however the study notes an important difference the mountain will yield only 14 years worth of coal from strip mining while a wind farm could operate indefinitely

6083083 futures markets exist to permit commercial interests to hedge their business risks for a fee a farmer or oil producer can put a floor under the price at which his product will sell the forward price is normally a bit lower than the current price but the contract protects the farmer from a catastrophic price slump such as may occur in for instance bumper years speculators buy the futures on the chance that the market price will be substantially higher they make a respectable profit on what is in effect an insurance function and a killing in years of drought flood and war this system works reasonably well so long as speculators do not actually control or manipulate prices for if they can drive prices way up they can obviously cash in while the farmer who has presold his crop cannot

6083097 ive used this theme in the past particularly about stroger fumbling stumbling suffering self inflicted media wounds his ridiculous haplessness reinforcing the political subtext the mayor of chicago thrives upon
6083098 that without daley to protect us we would get a stroger and the sky would fall
6083099 thats a political lie chicago thrives in spite of its politicians not because of them but it is a convenient falsehood artfully dropped into the news to help maintain the status quo
6083100 and emil jones the wily boss hog democrat gorging on patronage and the fruits of politics should have a new political job soon once his protege president obama finds one for him
6083101 i suppose emil jones could have stayed in the illinois senate and gotten more jobs and contracts for friends and family members
6083102 but jones on monday announced his retirement so it cant be said that he squeezed every dime he could out of the political system in illinois
6083103 in describing jones tenure as senate president one springfield reporter wrote that he long championed more money for school and education funding reform and made them his top priorities
6083104 i would have to say that jones talked about those things and how important they were for most of his 25 years in the senate
6083105 jones has made his preference clear he wants his son to take his senate seat
6083106 so at least one chicago child can thank jones for helping him
6083107 as for the rest of the kids in illinois they simply chose the wrong parents
6083108 you can get hung up on how clout in this town can take a nobody from nowhere and set him up for life with money prestige and a cushy job based solely on blood
6083109 or you can learn to respect an old chicago tradition
6083110 after their years of near irrelevance taking their orders and campaign cash from the soon to be retired emil jones the senate dems finally have a decision they can make all by themselves who will be their chambers new president
6083111 emil jones never was what his successor desperately needs to be
6083112 jones could have helped meet those crushing needs instead he lived by a simple credo spend other peoples money with abandon and let his jealousy of madigan the more powerful and cannier of the two entrap him in an alliance with the governor
6083113 you would think there would be outrage but outrage has fallen from fashion apparently i feel antique even complaining about it
6083114 at the very same moment barack obama an alumnus of the illinois state senate and a mentee of president jones is campaigning across america in behalf of change we can believe in and a new kind of politics here on the homefront we have his mentor playing the same old cynical game that treats public office like a family entitlement and the public payroll like a bequest
6083115 now president jones is pretty angry with us at the
6083116 what does emil jones iii have to say about his candidacy for his dads seat
6083117 senate president emil jones announced this week that he intends to retire after the fall veto session well thats a start in the right direction
6083118 it will surprise no one who reads this opinion page regularly that we are not fans of the 72 year old got to get me some food stamps jones who as time passed turned from harmless and sometimes entertaining into a bit of a power tripper turning state government into something of a personal plaything
6083119 that was fine if you were a friend or family member or contributor to jones and discovered that such relationships had rewards as the likes of jones wife and son and stepson and chicago state university and commonwealth edison did but if you werent you were out of luck at the taxpayer trough
6083120 arguably the last thing illinois government needs is yet another legislative leader from chicago
6083121 dont think badly of prof x because he didnt catch the glaring logical or factual errors in this paper dont think prof x necessarily agrees with my position
6083122 thanks for giving me whatever feedback you did dont feel like the flaws in this paper reflect badly on you
6083123 professor x read drafts of my manuscript and had a number of suggestions and criticisms some of which i responded to however even that does not free him from responsibility for any remaining errors or other things i may have said he could have destroyed my office and manuscripts burned my home or even had me killed that he did none of these things indicates that he is not committed to the total pursuit of the truth

6083126 thousands of cases of west nile virus have been reported worldwide but 80 of infected people dont show any symptoms
6083127 it is important to have highly sensitive and specific tests to diagnose infections and also to help track the ecology and epidemiology of west nile encephalitis
6083128 although the methods developed are for diagnosing west nile virus in horses the procedures can be easily modified to develop new antibody tests for humans and wildlife
6083129 it is essential to test wildlife for infection to determine the ecological and epidemiological aspects of west nile virus infections in nature so that we can try to control the disease by managing mosquito populations
6083130 we tested 43 privately owned horses for the infection the results showed that none of the horses with undiagnosed illnesses had been infected prior to the 1999 outbreak of west nile virus in connecticut usa
6083131 this kind of information is useful in confirming the epidemiology of the virus determining when it arrived in certain areas and how it spreads

6083164 baas monopoly control over the london airports has been highly detrimental to competition and consumers
6083165 baa has long ignored the needs of its airline users and the travelling public and provided inefficient gold plated facilities encouraged by an ineffectual regulator the caa
6083166 todays competition commission report is what we have been waiting for an honest and unbiased assessment of our airports
6083167 they have said what everyone knows that our airports arent working and that baa and regulation arent working
6083168 but lets not kid ourselves into thinking that the break up of baa will automatically result in a better deal for the travelling public
6083169 simply selling a monopoly airport from one greedy highly indebted capitalist to another will benefit no one part from the dealmakers in the city
6083170 gatwick will be sold to the highest bidder who will probably be highly indebted like ferrovial and like ferrovial will be expecting uk consumers to pick up the bill
6083171 we noted that a significant number of claimants would be asked to complete a form and we considered that because the ad stated that claimants could make a claim without having to fill out any forms the ad was misleading

6083173 you must make allowance for each others faults and forgive the person who offends you remember the lord forgave you so you must forgive others
6083174 for what what did i do that was so special
6083175 i certainly honor his service as a prisoner of war he was a hero to me and to hundreds of thousands and millions of others in the armed forces as a prisoner of war and he has traveled all over the world but he hasnt held executive responsibility
6083176 he hasnt been there and ordered the bombs to fall he hasnt seen what its like when diplomats come in and say i dont know whether were going to be able to get this point through or not

6083212 but mardi gras was on and new orleanians came from all over the country by plane and by car by minivan and bus from houston and atlanta from dallas and chicago and memphis and pittsburgh and st louis they made elaborate costumes in friends and relatives kitchens and brought them to town in the trunk of a rented car they flew in from albuquerque and salt lake city baltimore and d c and detroit they stayed in the hotel rooms that were available they stayed in friends guest rooms on couches on inflatable mattresses and futons or they camped out in their own houses with the mold on the walls or the blue tarpaulins covering the holes in the roof they stayed on the second floor they showered at a friends house across town they made do they figured out a way and when they ran into each other for the first time since the storm they embraced and heard as much of the others story as they could stand saying you are still here you are still alive the old new orleans funeral message the insistence upon the life that is left the reminder of how finite it all is how bitter and precious
6083213 im gonna take this money and move to new orleans and write my novel
6083214 it was right about that time that i first heard the wild tchoupitoulas and the wild tchoupitoulas had an effect on me that was similar to reading mailer for the first time i was big jazz lover a big blues lover but id never heard anything like that
6083215 all i needed to do was see the picture hear the chants i was riveted
6083216 a very rough romantic breakup that winter i was sitting at a table at the napoleon house and i wrote the first draft of the short story brownsville which later appeared in blues and trouble i remember this odd feeling of not having anything left to lose i was sick of myself at that point i was 31 and i remember being down here all that stuff i later wrote about in the post katrina manifesto why new orleans matters and something shifted in me and it was like i had found the sound something all my own
6083217 then i took the leap and moved down here in the fall of 1994
6083218 i was not thinking heh heh heh how can i write a novel of katrina
6083219 its not as if i didnt have a rich set of experiences or places and people and stories as we all did i was stewing in it for six months too
6083220 but in under two weeks i wrote 10 000 words and a complete synopsis and there you go
6083221 everybody in the book in some kind of way needs some kind of refuge either as a result of the storm or before the storm
6083222 at some point the characters need to find their way out of and readjust their relationship to a place of whats the word not acceptance not comfort not necessarily safety even
6083223 i think everybody who is in new orleans now had to make a choice to be here and it was not an automatic choice maybe for half of one percent of the people here it wasnt a question for everybody else it was a question
6083224 ive always felt that the difference between serious fiction and non serious fiction is that non serious fiction can lead you to believe that things dont have a cost if a bill is not presented for the choices a character makes its not serious in my view
6083225 i think to some degree it is hard for people to understand that a fiction writer turns everything in a book no matter how closely it might seem to resemble actual fact actual persons actual places into something imaginary even if a writer is writing a novel about his or her best friend in the course of that writing the friend turns into something else a character
6083226 it can be a fun parlor game to look for possible models for people and places in a novel but thats all it is if the novel is any good the people and places take on a special fictional life of their own
6083227 you can imagine how gratifying that is especially not being from new orleans to feel like youve made a contribution as a writer to a city i love more than anyplace else
6083228 you can write a lot of stuff and never have that sure a sense that people are receiving what youre putting out there you know
6083229 its a very unusual experience certainly in our time to be in a place or a society or a culture in which you can happily sign on to the collective elements of it but part of being part of that collective society is asserting your own individual self
6083230 look at all the second liners everybodys got their own little take their own little move their own way of swiveling that ankle just the way everybody has their own way of cooking red beans were very lucky its a precious and irreplaceable and rare experience to be part of a community where the sense of belonging comes from really being yourself
6083231 the clinton and bush foreign policy teams acted on the basis of two false premises
6083232 one was that russia is innately aggressive and that the end of the cold war could not possibly change this so we had to expand our military alliance up to its borders despite all the pious blather about using nato to promote democracy the belief in russias eternal aggressiveness is the only basis on which nato expansion ever made sense especially when you consider that the russians were told they could not join the other premise was that russia would always be too weak to endanger any new nato members so we would never have to commit troops to defend them it would cost us nothing they were wrong on both counts
6083233 on the night of aug 7 saakashvili ordered an artillery barrage against tskhinvali and sent an armored column to occupy the town he apparently hoped that western support would protect georgia from major russian retaliation even though russian peacekeepers were almost certainly killed or wounded in the georgian assault it was a huge miscalculation
6083234 was foolish and possibly criminal but unlike putin he has led his country in a broadly democratic direction curbed corruption and presided over rapid economic growth that has not relied as russias mostly does on high oil and gas prices

6083251 microsoft corp s unlikely alliance with linux software vendor novell inc
6083252 novell doesnt mind though in fact it thinks selling its soul to steve ballmer was a tremendous idea
6083253 i suppose the goal is to repeat the myth enough times that people start to believe it bill really got his panties in a twist over novell in 1988 when dr dos 5 as well as years before that
6083254 so where have these journalists been the last 20 years that they havent noticed that bill gates has been gunning for novell since the 1980s

6083273 were learning how to dress our pear apple or hourglass physique to best effect and maybe even how to relax and relish in looking good naked
6083274 but are we as savvy when it comes to dressing and accessorising our homes many of the same principles of proportion colour and style can be applied to one of our homes greatest assets the windows
6083275 like bodies its very unlikely that any two windows will be identical and even in the same house its very probable that theyll be a variety of different styles shapes and sizes
6083276 here are some rules and tips for highlighting their assets and minimising their flaws and if you are indeed tempted to practise how to look good naked then you really do need to make sure that your window at least is properly dressed

6083283 large scale efforts to manage the environment have a decidedly mixed record of success
6083284 old mines like the orphan were mined in the 1950s under no federal regulations whatsoever
6083285 most mines today are above the water table which makes chances of leakage practically nil what we have now is a well regulated industry
6083286 we already have the clean water act the national environmental policy act and others that require comprehensive analyses before any mining is done so there wont be impacts to the environment
6083287 at this time were still evaluating plans on an individual basis but a regional study is not something i can rule out
6083288 we hear from the industry and federal government that today we can do it safely
6083289 but thats not the way we do things today we understand and know a lot more about uranium radium and radon and the impacts of those so to say some things that happened in the 1950s and 1960s will happen again today is not a good comparison
6083290 when you take uranium and the other trace elements out of their resting places in nature and expose them to the environment
6083291 you expose them in higher concentrations to the environment and intensify their effects people dont appreciate the cumulative impact of mining in a consolidated area theres a very real threat
6083292 they would continue to be mobile through the aquifer and eventually discharge in springs impacting the human uses of water of these springs
6083293 statements that the historic operations at the orphan mine have been polluting horn creek are false

6083301 we had some verbal abuse from bnp members as they drove past but i dont think theyll be back here next year despite what the party says about the attendance we only counted 75 cars in the car park on saturday if they do try and hold the event here again the residents will do what they did before object to it and try to stop it taking place
6083302 the bnp has chosen for another year to hold the festival in an area where it is not wanted the people who live in this area are intimidated by the narrow views of the party they dont represent the views of the majority of the people it isnt what they want for their families
6083303 the views of the bnp are not credible they encourage racism and hate and stand for fascist values its not right they have been allowed to get a base anywhere which attributes them credibility
6083304 were very grateful to alan for letting us hold the event here were looking at a number of sites potentially for next year and havent decided where we want to go but this is a very central location very convenient the local people are very supportive and helpful so we may be back well see the labour party and its supporters are quite entitled to demonstrate and we are entitled to be here with our families enjoying ourselves as well

6083585 i think they saw a guy down the road who could be an every down defensive end i thank them for the opportunity they gave me against miami i wish i could have better capitalized on the opportunity if you look at yourself like that a pass rusher teams think hes one dimensional and cant hold up against the run
6083586 i expect every time i go into a game to make a play right now i feel im the kind of person that i dont need a certain play to keep my confidence up right now i feel like im right where i need to be steadily learning steadily progressing not trying to put too much added pressure on his shoulders my balloon wasnt burst
6083587 hes been really having a very good camp for us and has played pretty well the last couple of games
6083588 if he can continue to do that and do it every practice and every week then weve got something
6083589 when she chops at the ball the shots are long and have a lot of spin and she doesnt hit them high its difficult to hit them hard
6083590 this singles competition will be very tough well definitely face some difficulties so we can only take it one match at a time
6083591 of course id like to beat wang nan i have never won against wang nan before
6083592 but no matter win or lose i will do my best id like to show the crowd a spectacular match
6083593 maybe after winning the silver medal she was feeling more pressure
6083594 i actually havent been playing very well throughout this competition so i wasnt expecting to win today
6083595 i was just thinking i would compete as best as i could and in the end i played pretty well
6083596 im just taking everything step by step enjoying the ride
6083597 i really want to spend as much time with my friends and family as i can
6083598 its coming up on two months on the road i want to be able to see them and just relax
6083599 well my careers over lets toast all downhill from here
6083600 my friends in the car business so hes going to help me
6083601 ive been looking at some astin martins and some maseratis it would be pretty sweet to get an old school aston martin some of the old school james bond ones that would be sick
6083602 it kind of bugs me im always getting rocked i need to get my video game skills up thats for sure
6083603 i would rather it be three months but i wanted it to be five so that it was probably longer than he wants and when he comes back hes really ready to come back
6083604 hes on his own now he makes all the decisions outside the pool and i take care of the pool
6083605 in athens he had never had any personal freedom at all now hes had a lot and hes screwed it up and hes learned what that means hes done a pretty good job with it i had my doubts in the beginning that we were going to get there but now i think hes got it down
6083606 it sounds really cliched but its true hes really grown as a human being
6083607 that in itself is going to serve him well as he makes these decisions in the upcoming few months and few years
6083608 i think hell just want to be a celebrity whatever that means hell just have to keep improving if he wants to do that he handles himself so much better than he did i was just amazed at some of the answers he gave to a lot of these questions this time
6083609 im happy to help him out if he wants a hand with some of these things
6083610 i think its just distant i dont think its good or bad theres not much there
6083611 its like michael said the other day debbie wants to go to rome i want to go to rome thats why were going
6083612 itll just be what it is he could probably do without it
6083613 we just have to play it by ear and see how things go but definitely start some new events and see where it takes us
6083614 whatever happens on the weekend im going to be in the history book
6083615 the most troublesome thing were the 10 stitches i have on my chin i was very worried if i get a hit and started oozing blood i may be stopped by the referee from fighting it was a psychological thing which played its part
6083616 with the skill ive got i should beat him every day

6083634 with the skill ive got i should beat him every day
6083635 i dont know him and i havent been able to watch his finals because ive been focussing on my training
6083636 why is it not going to plan i havent the faintest idea it aint over yet but something has to be remedied and we are running out of time to do so
6083637 when i was at lsu the last few years we had a lot of success
6083638 but did we ever reach perfection you just gotta keep raising your standard you can never be satisfied no matter how good you get you keep getting better
6083639 my belief is theres two things you have to be able to win football games right off the bat
6083640 you have to be able to stop the run and youve got to be able to run the football on offense
6083641 if were able to do that if youre able to control the clock youre able to control the pace of the football game its going to make you better not only on offense but on defense as well i think thats something that you have to be able to do and something were going to be committed to doing at nebraska
6083642 i was really taken back when i first got back to nebraska seeing the numbers the offensive numbers that were happening in the big 12
6083643 for a defensive guy that kind of woke me up a little bit i think its become an offensive league to a certain extent
6083644 but i think at the same time youve got to be able to play good defense to win football games
6083645 were nowhere near where we want to be yet but well get there
6083646 theres plenty of time but fortunately ive been in this situation a number of times over the last couple of years where we installed a defense and were trying to get a group ready to play football and get game ready and i think that well be ready to go come august 30 vs western michigan

6083754 one of the most dangerous nights of the year for our young people
6083755 oh those sunglasses are only 1700 dollars ill take three
6083756 i stand before you today at a defining moment in our history
6083757 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
6083758 that is john mccains prerogative he can run that kind of campaign and frankly thats how political campaigns have been run in recent years but i believe the american people are better than that i believe that this defining momenttan demands something more of us
6083759 if we think that we can secure our country by just talking tough without acting tough and smart then we will misunderstand this moment and miss its opportunities
6083760 six years ago i stood up at a time when it was politically difficult to oppose going to war in iraq and argued that our first priority had to be finishing the fight against osama bin laden and al qaeda in afghanistan
6083761 in the run up to the invasion of iraq i warned that war would fan the flames of extremism in the middle east create new centers of terrorism and tie us down in a costly and open ended occupation
6083762 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
6083763 lets be clear our troops have completed every mission theyve been given
6083764 this is the central front in the war on terrorism
6083765 for years i have called for more resources and more troops to finish the fight in afghanistan
6083766 we must also recognize that we cannot succeed in afghanistan or secure america as long as there is a terrorist safe haven in northwest pakistan
6083767 i argued for years that we need to move from a
6083768 today our attention is also on the republic of georgia and senator mccain and i both strongly support the people of georgia and the americans delivering humanitarian aid
6083769 for months i have called for active international engagement to resolve the disputes over south ossetia and abkhazia
6083770 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
6083771 so lets have a serious debate and lets debate our disagreements on the merits of policy not personal attacks
6083772 my father left when i was 2 so my grandfather was the man who helped raise me
6083773 they were among the men and women of our greatest generation
6083774 and these veterans didnt just receive a hand from washington they did their part to lift up america just as theyd done their duty in defending it
6083775 i am a part of that legacy without it i would not be standing on this stage today and as president i will do everything that i can to keep the promise to advance the american dream for all our veterans and to enlist them in the cause of building a stronger america
6083776 our young men and women in uniform have proven that they are the equal of the greatest generation on the battlefield
6083777 it starts with those who choose to remain in uniform as well as their families
6083778 the vfw has done an extraordinary job of standing by our military families helping out with everything from a phone card for a soldier who is overseas to an extra hand around the house
6083779 for those who return to civilian life i will support their american dream in this 21st century just as we supported generations of veterans in the 20th
6083780 we must also stand up for affordable health care for every single veteran
6083781 and we must expand and enhance our ability to identify and treat ptsd and traumatic brain injury at all levels from enlistment to deployment to civilian life
6083782 economic security for our veterans also depends on revamping an overburdened benefits system
6083783 just as we give veterans the support they deserve we must also engage them and all americans in a new cause renewing america
6083784 just think of the skills that our troops have developed through their service
6083785 that means expanding programs like troops to teachers that put veterans at the front of the classroom
6083786 this is how we can help our veterans live their dreams while helping our country meet the challenges of the 21st century
6083787 i thought of that trust last week when i visited the pearl harbor memorial
6083788 i still remember the day that we laid my grandfather to rest
6083789 this is what we owe our troops and our veterans because in every note of taps and in every folded flag we hear and see an unwavering belief in the idea of america the idea that no matter where you come from or what you look like or who your parents are this is a place where anything is possible where anyone can make it where we look out for each other and take care of each other where we rise and fall as one nation as one people its an idea thats worth fighting for an idea for which so many americans have given that last full measure of devotion now it falls to us to advance that idea just as so many generations have before

6083828 would john mccain ever pick a running mate in favor of retreat in iraq
6083829 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
6083830 whether im impeached or not the countrys stability will be compromised the office of the president will also be insulted pakistan is my love now and always my life is for pakistan i have defended and will continue to defend pakistan i want to be able to bring pakistan out of the current crisis so i think perhaps i should do something but i also do not want to do something that may generate uncertainty in the country i also want to save the parliament from horse trading even if the impeachment is defeated the relations between the presidents office and the coalition govt will not heal therefore with this situation in view and having consulted my legal and political advisors i have decided to resign from my post
6083831 how much i hate india and how much i will sacrifice to save muslim brothers in kashmir
6083832 that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
6083833 senator mccain was in a motorcade led by the united states secret service and held in a green room with no broadcast feed
6083834 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
6083835 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
6083836 that room was totally free with no monitors a flat out lie
6083837 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because that what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
6083838 a motorist survey this year by the rubber manufacturers association found that 85 percent of american drivers do not properly check tire inflation pressure this is an alarming statistic since tires are the only part of a vehicle in contact with the road and a critical vehicle safety component
6083839 drivers across the u s can battle rising gas prices by simply maintaining proper tire inflation
6083840 current statistics indicate that 82 million vehicles have under inflated tires which means more rubber is hitting the road and accordingly miles per gallon is lessened in fact tire experts speculate that 2 8 billion gallons of gas is wasted by u s drivers each year simply because theyre driving on under inflated tires
6083841 the chps traffic safety commitment extends to safety campaigns like these which aim to reduce needless fatalities and injuries on california highways
6083842 our research shows that this improper inflation issue has been prevalent for years
6083843 that andreas excuse for leveling accusation against mac you buy into that prfsr
6083844 we as a campaign have not said anything about it though the mccain folks do seem pretty sensitive on the point
6083845 he made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops
6083846 obama had no intention of bringing any cameras with him i was there i can vouch for that

6083881 boy buggering in both islam and catholicism is okay with the pope as long as it isnt reported by the liberal press
6083882 so this is what the last days of the catholic church are going to look like buggering boys undermines the moral base and the laywers rip the gold off the vatican altars we may get one more pope when this senile one dies but thats probably about it

6083888 from my perspective as a conservative evangelical barack obamas campaign and the democratic party have taken a historic and courageous step toward empowering women for an expanded range of choices and saving babies lives

6083893 there was a pushback by those of us who worked in a more progressive vein who see faith as broader than just those three issues
6083894 people who were religious but not tied up in the conservative religious movement felt that religion had been hijacked
6083895 they went into politics because of a religious commitment a concern about the poor for instance it was actually their faith in many cases that had pulled them into public service
6083896 most of the important movements for social change in america have been fueled by religion progressive religion
6083897 people began to see we have to retrieve religious language
6083898 there are a lot of things in catholic social teaching and straight out of the scripture that make sense
6083899 most of us in this line of work have a significant motivator
6083900 for me it was an experience that i had as a young man in honduras working with missionaries that really transformed the goals of how i wanted to use my life i cant answer the question of why i run without talking about my spiritual journey
6083901 a common desire among catholics to have a united voice and message
6083902 the notion of the common good is absent or eclipsed in the public square
6083903 especially difficult because we underestimate the extent to which politics has invaded our discussions of religion and morality
6083904 the core divisions among religious americans and particularly christians are no longer defined by theological issues the splits are political
6083905 one of the things we had to learn at network was to use faith language that connects both with policy and with the heart before faith language was just a given we didnt speak out of it it was like the most sacred part of us the part we hate about the right is having it rammed down our throats we overreacted by not talking about it at all instead of talking about it in a way that was integral to us
6083906 language and ways of speaking authentically that communicate the greater vision

6083938 i think this is a direct and deliberate slight and snub to the leaders of the pacific island countries assembled here in niue

6083940 what im hearing from others whove been to fiji is that the commodore is not just baulking at the commitment for march 2009
6083941 there is no timetable for 2009 2010 2012 or any other time
6083942 let me place on record that the commitments that commodore bainimarama made at the leaders retreat were not forced on him as some have claimed
6083943 pacific island countries are saying to the countries of the world that the time for action concrete action over climate change is now

6083988 the tide has clearly turned in that the majority of employers believe in the long term value and positive impact that comprehensive wellness and disease management programs provide
6083989 keeping the healthy employees healthy while stabilizing and or improving the health of employees with chronic conditions will dramatically improve everyones health and quality of life
6083990 this survey illustrates that employers have a high level of confidence in their ability to control health care costs and that their employees can make informed choices if given the additional tools necessary to do so
6083991 in the current environment the absence of readily available price and quality data coupled with an expectation of both employers and employees to make sound health care decisions is like asking someone to navigate turbulent waters while blindfolded and without the ability to steer
6083992 overall the survey results show that employers take their role as the primary source for health care coverage in america quite seriously
6083993 employers have made it quite clear that they cannot take sole responsibility for health care costs they need to partner with employees physicians hospitals and the government to find a solution to the health care crisis we are all experiencing

6084026 so we want our cake and eat it too we all agree that assessment is an essential component of the learning process it shows the progress of the learner the accuracy of the learning the suitability of the pace of instruction and lots of other important data for tracking the learning process and yet because we are introducing diversity applying multiple intelligences to bear on our students learning and encouraging them to take ownership and responsibility over their own learning process when it comes to taking standardized tests it seems like allowing everyone to run free for a while and then suddenly yanking on their leashes and bringing them all back to the kennel we told them they were being released from in this model their learning is still about the test whatever our intentions were

6084098 the nlis data set contains approximately 20 million individual cattle movements so to model it we used a massive agent based modelling approach that is grounded in complex systems science
6084099 such modelling is only possible through the use of modern computing algorithms and high performance computers
6084100 the model uses real individual animal movement data and simulates approximately ten million cattle where every individual animal has an fmd natural history
6084101 epidemiological know how was provided by dr graeme garner from daff where there is much enthusiasm about what has been achieved this will complement existing regional modelling initiatives and significantly enhance australias contingency planning for exotic diseases
6084102 the model will enable various scenarios to be explored including control strategies and impacts of vaccination and also determine where there are research gaps which together will improve our ability to prepare for and manage such threats

6084130 we are pleased to introduce to the legal market a product such as divorce financials
6084131 we believe it will change the standard of care in family law

6084133 the challenge has been calculating tax optimized settlement options without bankrupting the client because every what if negotiation question from the client would necessitate a prohibitively expensive do over divorce financials changes this with the click of a button the software automatically completes the calculation for the new scenario as well as tracks and presents equitable distributions

6084142 my friends we have reached a crisis the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the cold war this is an act of aggression
6084143 with its actions in recent days russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the twenty first century
6084144 i want to have a dialogue with the russians i want them to get out of georgian territory as quickly as possible and i am interested in good relations between the united states and russia
6084145 our position is that we are ready to cooperate with russia in any project that can strengthen its security i think russia really has to think of the response it will make when it finds itself closed in a circle
6084146 on this issue we fully support russia the war which was unleashed by georgia is the culmination of attempts to encircle and isolate russia we oppose all these attempts as we think that this is a continuation of u s cold war era policy what russia has done is to defend its legitimate interests
6084147 georgia started the crisis but the west is blaming russia everywhere there is total disinformation distortion of facts and international attempts to isolate russia

6084250 for some time ive mused on norfolk being an island bounded on two sides by the sea and on the other two sides by the river waveney and the great and little ouse
6084251 i decided it would be a wonderful adventure to make a trip around norfolk by water and now i am doing it for charity in all the time i have been planning the trip i havent heard of anyone who has attempted the voyage before but if anyone has i would certainly be interested to hear from them

6084452 behind the world food crisis is a global freshwater crisis expected to rapidly worsen as climate change impacts intensify
6084453 irrigation fed agriculture provides 45 percent of the worlds food supplies and without it we could not feed our planets population of six billion people
6084454 progress and prospects on water for a clean and healthy world with special focus on sanitation
6084455 the number of people living without a supply of improved drinking water has now dropped well below one billion
6084456 more than half the global population now have water piped to their homes and the number of people using unimproved water supplies continues to decline
6084457 the regional sanitation conferences for example such as latinosan africasan easan and sacosan produced unprecedented declarations that provide a strong foundation for developing the water and sanitation sector in these regions
6084458 it also provides a solid basis for further developing the sector in africa i personally consider this result to be an enormous leap forward
6084459 the reports worrying conclusion is that at the current rate the world will miss its mdg sanitation target by more than 700 million people if we are to reach the target we now need to provide at least 173 million people per year with access to improved sanitation
6084460 you show the same commitment and willpower and the olympic dream is also your dream to strive for a bright future of mankind one world one dream a world in which everyone can lead a healthy life in dignity a world that offers the chance of personal development for all this is our common dream
6084461 irrigating with wastewater isnt a rare practice limited to a few of the poorest countries
6084462 its a widespread phenomenon occurring on 20 million hectares across the developing world especially in asian countries like china india and vietnam but also around nearly every city of sub saharan africa and in many latin american cities as well
6084463 of the large potential of wastewater agriculture for both helping and hurting great numbers of urban consumers
6084464 and it isnt just affluent consumers of exotic vegetables whose welfare is at stake
6084465 poor consumers of inexpensive street food also depend on urban agriculture
6084466 even this tiny proportion however would be enough for humans to live on earth if the water cycle was properly functioning and if we managed our water use wisely
6084467 water management for human needs alone is damaging the natural systems we all depend on
6084468 we are also concerned that the world continues to mainly discuss adaption to climate change rather than doing it
6084469 we have been doing it all over the world and we have found that that improving the health of freshwater ecosystems now makes a great contribution to improving their resilience to climate impacts in the future
6084470 la parte georgiana sigue tomando iniciativas de redespliegue y de recuperaci n de la capacidad de combate de sus fuerzas
6084471 jed babbin one of our military analysts is hosting the michael medved nationally syndicated radio show this afternoon he would like to see if general george w casey would be available for a phone interview
6084472 this would be a softball interview and the show is 8th or 9th in the nation
6084473 i hope you are getting a cut of babbins action as his agent
6084474 im subbing for hugh hewitt again tomorrow and want to bash the un report
6084475 i asked for u s army major general jay hood and got the answer that the military isnt going out on that now can you do it please call asap
6084476 he is going to be on the cnbc show kudlow amp company tonight and want sic to be prepared if they ask him about the al qaeda threat to saudi oil fields anything we could share with him
6084477 fox news hannity and colmes is having jed babbin on today to talk about north korea
6084478 we are getting jed a one pager on the status of forces in the korean peninsula the message being we still have a massive deterrent there for north korea we will also put him into touch with state for talking points on the 6 party talks
6084479 i have information thats given to me by sources of all sorts private information is what you normally do in washington you get confidential sources and you rely on them im not compromised i cant speak for anybody else other than myself but i have no relationship with defense contractors i have no contracts with the pentagon theres no conflict there
6084480 when you hire a former general as a media commentator youre hiring him for his expertise and his ability to independently analyze whats going on
6084481 if youre assuming because hes retired he has a measure of independence and then you find out no hes actually been to all these trainings where hes received talking points thats a problem you have promised your audience that youre going to deliver them independent analysis not a mouthpiece for the pentagon
6084482 the journalists had the obligation to figure out if their sources were independent
6084483 each show decided how they were going to use these people and at that point somebody shouldve been having a conversation about what theyre bringing to the product and how that works and then finally there should be an overall standard that says when we hire people here is what we should ask of them
6084484 everyone i wrote for and so forth knew i was talking to people in the pentagon
6084485 im not sure if jed mentioned he was a part of the department of defenses military analyst program he might at some point he said over the years though that hes been part of many many briefings at the pentagon most when he was actually working there under bush 41
6084486 jed babbin is the editor of human events he wrote for national review he wrote for american spectator hes conservative
6084487 were a conservative talk show mr babbins been on our show many many times over the years and he comes from a conservative background he was privy to a number of briefings we took advantage of hearing what was in those briefings
6084488 if they were buying my loyalty they got a pretty bad bargain if they thought they were buying my reporting they really had a very poor investment look at my stories look at what ive written ive been very highly critical at times of the president and a lot of the people who conduct the war
6084489 we really should try to help babbin secure guests for his radio hosting gigs he is consistently solid and helpful
6084490 im sure all your folks are familiar with the tremendous support weve received from jed
6084491 i have lined up the support of most of them but also wanted to highlight the secretarys role in having started these gatherings
6084492 you see the clinton crowd simply ignored us and hoped we would just go away you guys deserve credit for having had the smarts to invite us into the fold with all the hell that gets raised in washington about government cover ups and concealments its actually refreshing that somebody thought to inform some rather knowledgeable observers about what was really going on
6084493 i know ken quite well and i dont know why he gave it that characterization
6084494 i asked a lot of tough questions and sometimes got answers that were satisfactory and some that werent
6084495 the briefings and all other interactions with the military analysts had been suspended indefinitely pending an internal review
6084496 but obviously i talk to a lot of people in this town
6084497 it was a fantastic win you have to hit and move in amateur boxing and you will win and i am good at it i kept my focus and kept a nice high guard

6084500 i propose to offer mr vieweg an epic poem hermann and dorothea which will have approximately 2000 hexameters concerning the royalty we will proceed as follows i will hand mr b ttiger a sealed note which contains my demand and wait for what mr vieweg will suggest to offer for my work if his offer is lower than my demand then i take my note back unopened and the negotiation is broken if however his offer is higher then i will not ask for more than what is written in the note to be opened by mr b ttiger
6084501 i was there when it was unveiled and i was totally embarrassed to be standing in front of the world naked but over time its something that im more and more proud of that im standing in front of the coliseum and it was welcoming the world to the olympics in 84 its a little embarrassing having pigeon stuff sit up on shoulders up there but im dealing with it

6084535 continuing our welcome back to school week we covered civics yesterday we now have a science lesson for our readers it has been posited lately that all a team needs to be successful is talent if the genes are in place the wins will come classic examples of team biology defeating team chemistry include lebron james and the cavs reaching the nba finals over detroits 5 man team concept in 2006 allen iverson and the philadelphia 76ers run to the finals in 2001 and the jason kidd led new jersey nets reaching the nba finals in 2002 pure and simple these teams were examples of how one incredibly talented individual overcame the accumulated chemistry of well balanced teams on the opposite side you have detroit in 2004 when they dethroned the lakers led by kobe bryant shaquille oneal karl monroe and gary payton clearly the genes were on the lakers side in that series but the pistons chemistry carried the day the pistons have been to 6 consecutive conference finals with a group of players originally believed to be fringe performers at best but their combined strength was better than their individual excellence to be a successful franchise you need both chemistry and biology

6084567 that has enabled researchers to begin designing small molecule drugs to shut down the action of smurf 1 and its relatives furthermore since mice engineered to have less smurf1 expression develop thicker bones future drugs that shut down smurf1 may be also useful against more common forms of osteoporosis simply by changing the dose of course this is early stage work with many obstacles ahead but it is exciting nonetheless

6084615 most of the worlds transboundary river basins lack adequate legal protection
6084616 this essential treaty has languished in limbo for more than a decade largely due to the failure of nations in not signing up to what they long ago agreed to
6084617 because most of the worlds transboundary river basins lack adequate legal protection the world needs a global framework for sustainably managing and preventing disputes over those resources
6084618 this is the only such framework available in the timescale to help us deal with a growing water crisis
6084619 behind the world food crisis is a global freshwater crisis expected to rapidly worsen as climate change impacts intensify
6084620 egs enhanced geothermal systems could be the killer app of the energy world it has the potential to deliver vast quantities of power 24 7 and be captured nearly anywhere on the planet and it would be a perfect complement to intermittent sources like solar and wind

6084622 special permission will be required for the promotion of all white men without disabilities
6084623 only applicants who do not meet job requirement standards will be considered
6084624 the goal is to maximize favorable publicity and build excitement for the conventions without creating problems that could mushroom in the hothouse atmospheres of denver and st paul
6084625 geothermal energy which is sometimes known as hot rocks has got a huge potential for australia both as a solution to climate change and in terms of national energy security
6084626 one percent of reserves would produce 26 000 years of energy supplies
6084627 the upper cost boundary will decline over time because the level of uncertainty is expected to narrow as the industry grows this cost is expected to be lowest cost of any form of renewable or low emissions energy
6084628 we could now see australias first commercially viable geothermal power plants in place within four to five years
6084629 geothermal energy provides clean base load power and is potentially a very important contributor to australias energy mix in a carbon constrained world

6084647 if you are a good trader why do you need me to fund your effort that does not make sense but it tells me you make more money selling than you do trading
6084648 you need to use two or three comparison sites and check directly with providers to get the best quote and remember that cheapest isnt always best its a false economy if you dont get enough cover for your needs or have to pay a huge excess if you claim
6084649 this research is nearly two months out of date and since then weve added even more insurers and products to our service and will be adding still more in the very near future
6084650 our customer promise makes it clear that our aim is to compare more providers than any other site to list every provider and make clear which ones we dont list and why that the price you see is the price you pay and that you wont get cheaper by going direct
6084651 the questions we ask are designed to offer customers real prices and not estimates something which we pride ourselves on

6084657 you have to compete in the same way for your readers attention he is not looking for your sales letter he has a thousand and one other things more important to him to occupy his mind why should he divert his attention from them to plow through pages of type about you or your projects
6084658 we just thought these books are all sort of the same so we are going to spice this one up a bit and see if we can fire up a little interest we looked at all the characters and we decided that the one that is the hottest is emma so we decided that hermione should maybe get a little action in the next movie and thats what were going to do

6084665 up until very recently we were satisfied that through working closely with the organizer and showground committee appropriate control measures could be put in place to mitigate the threat this position has now changed
6084666 as a consequence the recommendation to cancel has been forwarded to the showground committee
6084667 the other option of course is to do away with some not all theatre majors and make them very strong minors instead that students can combine with other degrees
6084668 i admire evel knievel because he was the original he invented extreme sports i grew up in france watching the excitement and suspense of his jumps he defied skeptics ignored fear and pushed the limits

6084685 weve learned that nvidia is working hard to launch gt200 55nm but this will most certainly wont happen in august or september our sources imply that this will take place in q4 2008 nvidia simply wants to win the performance crown back from r700 adding gddr5 memory and 55nm process will certainly speed things up and they will take the dissipation down thermal dissipation is nvidias biggest problem as the chip turns to be extremely hot and the new 55nm should be a bit better once you take care of thermals you can clock the chip higher which eventually means more performance the 55nm process with a new clock and gddr5 memory should get gt200 55nm a bit faster than r700 and this is exactly what nvidia needs

6084688 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us

6084690 welcome to chilo a planet with corrosive rain crushing pressure and deadly heat fortunately fourteen year old timas lives in one of the domed cities that float 100 000 feet above the surface circling near the edge of a monstrous perpetual storm above the acidic clouds the temperature and pressure are normal but to make a living timas like many other young men is lowered to the surface in an armored suit to scavenge what he can timass life is turned upside down when a strange man crash lands on the city the newcomer is fleeing an alien intelligence intent on invading the planet and discovering the secret hidden deep inside the perpetual storm a secret that could lead to interplanetary war

6084701 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative

6084704 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
6084705 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war
6084706 sharp as he can be in his judgments he is equally sharp in identifying the virtues of what he doesnt like he gives a spacious view of the countryside whatever the particular road he hews through it he takes his subjects seriously but not himself like snow white you might say
6084707 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
6084708 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent

6084713 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
6084714 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
6084715 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
6084716 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
6084717 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
6084718 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
6084719 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks

6084724 the chinese government is desperate to turn the worlds attention away from its abuses in tibet as the olympics take place but the creativity and determination of tibetans and their supporters has once again ensured that tibetan voices are heard and seen in beijing despite the massive security clampdown
6084725 the chinese leadership must realize that the only way it can make the issue of tibet disappear is to acknowledge the demands of the tibetan people and work with them to bring an end to chinas occupation of tibet

6084765 he who has my commandments and keeps them it is he who loves me and he who loves me will be loved by my father and i will love him and manifest myself to him
6084766 lord how is it that you will manifest yourself to us and not to the world
6084767 if anyone loves me he will keep my word and my father will love him and we will come to him and make our home with him
6084768 he who does not love me does not keep my words and the word which you hear is not mine but the fathers who sent me
6084769 he will glorify me for he will take of what is mine and declare it to you
6084770 these things i have spoken to you while being present with you
6084771 but the helper the holy spirit whom the father will send in my name he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all things that i said to you
6084772 peace i leave with you my peace i give to you not as the world gives do i give to you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid
6084773 you have heard me say to you i am going away and coming back to you if you loved me you would rejoice because i said i am going to the father for my father is greater than i

6084776 i will no longer talk much with you for the ruler of this world is coming and he has nothing in me
6084777 i have to be quiet now because satan is coming
6084778 why should the lord stop talking here just because satan was coming
6084779 but that the world may know that i love the father and as the father gave me commandment so i do arise let us go from here

6084785 we made some changes to the bike it wasnt perfect but it was easier to ride and i managed to go a lot faster
6084786 its a long time since i won two races in a row it means we are back in business and back on pace
6084787 it has been a difficult period for the team but now we are so strong
6084788 we are now at the top of the championship so we must stay concentrated and have more wins like this
6084789 i had quite a lot of pressure because angel was waiting with the special leathers to join me on the bike so i really needed to win
6084790 im going to smile because we must celebrate this and not pay attention to the pain
6084791 all my body is in pain but im so happy
6084792 it was a difficult and very aggressive race but i was determined to stay on the bike
6084793 the bike was flying all the way to the end it probably would even have been a bit quicker if it hadnt been so windy
6084794 i just wanted to show everybody that the bike is perfect and that the team is perfect
6084795 before i came here i thought if i got into the top six id be over the moon but to get on to the podium is something im very proud of
6084796 i cant believe it the superbike race was amazing but this was really special
6084797 all the top riders were in the race and the bike worked so well on lap two i got my head down and it really felt good
6084798 once i crested the mountain on the last lap i knew it was mine
6084799 i am just happy to keep the superstock crown for suzuki and the relentless team

6084805 zaheer did the job for us as he bowled in right areas credit also goes to badrinath as he had not played before
6084806 we needed this victory there was pressure on us especially after losing opener stiff neck before the match we would have liked to win comfortably but in the end it is about winning
6084807 we knew we could win this match only by getting wickets we tried hard but dhoni and badrinath batted really well and their partnership took the game away from us
6084808 the important thing was to be consistent and bowl in right areas
6084809 as a spearhead of the attack it was important for me to provide early breakthroughs all the bowlers did well and kept pressure on their batsmen

6084854 our inaugural field day will be the first of what i hope are many significant events towards the proliferation of quail in west texas
6084855 im really intrigued by the concept of patch burn grazing as it relates to quail habitat management
6084856 we initiated this project last march as a way to develop a quail friendly approach to prickly pear management
6084857 we only burn parts of pastures then follow with a light stocking rate of cattle
6084858 the cows graze the burned area resulting in more weeds beneficial to quail but by not burning the whole pasture we are leaving adjacent areas that provide excellent nesting and escape cover

6084887 from the very beginning we were dedicated to raising as much as possible in support of this important cause
6084888 but when we saw how our restaurant neighborhoods rallied behind us year after year in our efforts we knew we were on the verge of something big and each year we raised the bar higher and before long the dream of reaching one million dollars became a reality
6084889 when alex told us that she was going to raise one million dollars we werent sure how to respond
6084890 she was a little girl with a big dream here we are eight years after we hung the first lemonade sign outside of our home and applebees is donating 1 million to her cause its amazing and we are extraordinarily grateful for their support
6084891 the goal of applebees is to provide a fun and friendly atmosphere where family friends and neighbors can come together
6084892 nothing speaks louder to this commitment than when we connect with our restaurant guests and work together towards a better tomorrow for our neighbors

6084911 i dont want any sex offenders in this country but the point is vietnamese officials have deported him to the uk so as we do whenever sex offenders return to this country we need to plan for what happens when people return
6084912 what government should be focused on is raising the incomes and the aspirations and the opportunities for the millions of people who are stuck on low incomes and that is where this government has failed not because they are bad people not because they dont have noble ambitions but because their measure which is entirely reliant on the state which is about redistribution has failed failed on their own terms
6084913 our education system is failing to spread opportunity our welfare system is keeping people out of work our tax system makes it extremely difficult for those on low incomes to get off those low incomes because those marginal tax rates are so high
6084914 labour has failed it has created a more unfair society and i think there is a real opportunity for the conservative party now to lead this debate
6084915 he was a very distinguished parliamentarian and social reformer who has left an indelible mark on his country the lives of millions of people over the years have been improved because of his social reforms

6084918 the shift of brand control from marketers to consumers has been dramatic and swift which can mostly be credited to the advent of digital technologies and the demand for instant information by consumers
6084919 landors clients are embracing this shift and i believe branddigital will provide a roadmap for marketers who recognize the critical need to leverage digital for continued brand growth and success
6084920 digital technology has not changed the basic principles of brand building what once was necessary to do our jobs is still necessary
6084921 whether one refers to it as a channel a medium or a discipline digital technology has served to redefine the scale of power of the essential truths of branding my objective is that everyone who reads this book becomes comfortable inside their digital skins
6084922 if i said it was a great ball game that would be an understatement this was softball at its best internationally

6084928 the single greatest strength america has in the middle east
6084929 if tomorrow peace broke out between israelis and palestinians does anybody think there wouldnt be a full blown war in iraq and conversely if iraq were transported to mars does anyone think there would not be terrorism visited upon the israelis every day
6084930 so lets get it straight israel is not the cause of iraq iraq being settled or not settled has nothing to do with israels conduct
6084931 from 9 11 americans can taste what it must feel like for every israeli mother and father when they send their kid out to school with their lunch to put them on a bus on a bicycle or to walk and they pray to god that cell phone doesnt ring

6084934 we are going to tbilisi warsaw and kyiv to meet with the leaders of these important american allies and to discuss the russian invasion of georgia
6084935 this is a moment in history when it is vital for the worlds democracies to stand in solidarity
6084936 its important that members of the united states congress show support and solidarity for these young democracies particularly in light of the recent aggression against georgia
6084937 i believe it is in our own national security interests to stop russia from continuing its aggressive actions against georgia or threatening other countries in the region

6084941 something grabs a hold of me tightly flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
6084942 would look at a banana and see something to be frozen microtomed processed into foam or liquid or maybe through some magic bit of alchemy turned into a meatball
6084943 waiters carefully place in front of us a square of lucite four inches by four inches by half an inch standing on edge on top of the square a sliver of metal holding what looks like a single yellow die on which the spots were applied by a blind person with a tiny brush this is according to the menu corn with coconut cayenne and lime it looks no more like corn or coconut cayenne or lime than a whopper looks like the queen of romania

6084985 the pace of decline has intensified due to job cuts and very sluggish economic activity since the beginning of the year particularly in those industries requiring commercial building spaces

6084993 the amount of software is growing very rapidly and it is increasingly difficult to find the people and resources necessary to develop it all
6084994 as a result europe is seeing a lot of development work transferring to india and other countries an additional problem lies in the speed of development as it is necessary to get solutions to market in optimum time and with sufficient reliability that it works properly
6084995 agile is a new paradigm for software development that emerged around eight years ago in the usa
6084996 when we started the itea project in 2004 we did not know whether this new methodology could be exploited for embedded software in avionics telecommunications automotive and consumer electronics
6084997 we turned this around to identify those critical features that would be used and put the emphasis on getting them to market first
6084998 so we are not always talking about technical issues when developing software but focusing on business level issues and this was part of the methodology of our development
6084999 eureka projects involve a lot less bureaucracy than with the eu framework programme projects
6085000 moreover over three years the world changes and with eureka you can change the direction of the project meeting better the demands of the industrial partners this is the clear advantage of eureka in addition itea offers a community that meets on a yearly basis and people get to know each other i think both industry and academia find this big networking element strengthens their capabilities
6085001 a set of values and a set of 12 principles provide the underlying rationale for why we operate in this way
6085002 and the process is very tightly time framed with delivery in monthly or even fortnightly cycles in previous approaches we were trying to deliver working systems in maybe three month six month or even one year cycles
6085003 these short cycles demand a radical change in thinking in the development of large hardware bound systems it requires the ability to deliver every two weeks or monthly and so requires rethinking of the whole system how we plan and how we estimate the costs of the development another crucial element is technological requiring investment but the benefits are quite clear
6085004 we showed we could actually achieve up to 70 reduction in lead time and costs
6085005 if these results could be sustained in the larger area of european software development it would be cheaper to outsource from india to europe than the other way round
6085006 we set a benchmark that we can achieve dramatic improvements in all areas in terms of time cost and quality which help shape the future of software development in europe
6085007 we have been able to go beyond what is being done in the usa currently putting europe ahead and while development teams in india and other countries have now set up their own technologies in this area europe has a competitive edge that should last several years
6085008 the memorandum sets out steps which should be taken in order to protect mother tongue education
6085009 at this event the mouths of the students and learners will be pasted closed to depict the extent to which mother tongue education is being repressed in south africa
6085010 research done by afriforum youth indicates that the department of education is grossly negligent when it comes to the lending of support to mother tongue education
6085011 the departments actions amount to a direct transgression of the youths fundamental right to education and equality our mouths are shut by the conduct of the department and we will show them this

6085023 home prices fell 3 1 percent acress the contry in the last year while they rose 7 7 percent in austin
6085024 austin has fared better than other texas markets because of its restrictive environment in getting residential projects approved which constrains the supply
6085025 texas also continues to lead the nation in job growth creating 13 900 jobs last year just under 2 percent growth according to the texas workforce commission
6085026 but the fallacy of the headline is that there is a direct competition between the two that its either or

6085028 the pace is heating up on finding sustainable alternatives to these energies and biofuels really are at the forefront of the debate
6085029 farmers profitability doesnt change retail prices and farmers profitability isnt guaranteed by high grain prices the same factors that are lifting grain prices are lifting production costs
6085030 so yes the farm price index is at 162 percent of what it was 1990 1992 but at the same time the price index measuring what farmers pay for services farm wages is 189 percent of base

6085041 for too long the investment advisor world has lagged other industries by failing to have the same kind of clear meaningful and tough quality control standards that are commonplace in other major industries ranging from manufacturing to medicine though the development may be overdue it is finally happening in the financial planning world tough new standards for financial planners are now coming online and they are going to separate the true fiduciaries from the financial salespeople driven by commissions and other conflicts while this no doubt will make maintaining the status quo difficult or even impossible for many planners it is very good news for financial consumers who want to know who they can trust
6085042 in the near future investors and members of the news media who embrace non fiduciaries touting themselves as investment advisors will have no one to blame but themselves
6085043 its a source of serious concern that so many lay investment stewards are unaware that there is a rigorous process required for due diligence of investment decisions naivety and best intentions are not an acceptable excuse for poor investment decision making and could leave these stewards open to criticism and litigation fiduciary standards and obligations are not a matter of personal opinion and preference they are the result of well established analysis and well founded procedures akin to a company directors considerable legal responsibilities they help determine acceptable risk level asset allocation the selection of appropriate investment managers and monitoring of strategy on an ongoing basis
6085044 tougher standards for fiduciaries that take that role seriously are the wave of the future for the investment advisory industry cefex certified firms including zag members have demonstrated their adherence to a standard of excellence reflecting the industrys best fiduciary practices investors and plan sponsors can be reassured that fiduciary practices have been independently overseen using a rigorous assessment process in our opinion these firms are now on a path of continuous improvement driven by a culture of fiduciary awareness and annual renewal assessments which will encourage leadership and staff to perform in their clients best interests

6085061 we are delighted that the planning inspector supported our advice that this scheme would cause serious damage to londons most perfect 18th century space the magnificent courtyard of somerset house as well as the iconic view of whitehall seen from the bridge over the lake in st james park
6085062 the inspector also agreed with us that the tower would overwhelm the grade ll star
6085063 we are therefore appalled to learn that the secretary of state has not only overturned the advice of english heritage as her expert advisors but she has also chosen to ignore the learned opinion of an independent inspector
6085064 english heritage finds it incomprehensible that her reason for doing so was because she considered that community benefits outweigh harm to the historic environment as though one must be at the sacrifice of the other
6085065 there are alternative options that would have provided the same community benefits but would have been more sensitive without causing serious damage to historic buildings spaces and views
6085066 obviously we do not consider this matter closed and we are considering our next steps and the options open to us

6085147 the russians seem to have targeted in particular the railway line a couple of bridges have been blown up and there are reports still coming in of bridges being mined
6085148 but apart from the railway line which has crucial strategic significance not just for georgia for armenia and azerbaijan particularly for armenia which is virtually dependent on it the russians have also been targeting the port of poti again a strategic outlet for all three trans caucasian states
6085149 today august 19 the russians have been in poti port having withdrawn for a brief while yesterday they went back in today with armored vehicles and a russian boat came in and they started removing equipment from the port and destroying georgian vessels there
6085150 this is significant as it represents a sale to a federal government entity which could lead to more sales to other government agencies the federal bureau of prisons could be expected to purchase another six systems in the future and the sales would be in excess of 100 000 it also is a result of efforts by the company to expand its dealer program nationwide

6085180 these centers will allow us to better identify and meet the unique needs of our rural veterans as their population continues to grow
6085181 in 1992 the russians really brought georgia to its knees at our hands the hands of caucasians the war in abkhazia was won by volunteers from the north caucasus republics and everyone knows it there were chechens kabardinians adygs ossetians and representatives of other north caucasian republics in those days we thought we were defending abkhazia which was striving for independence and only later did the realization come that the kremlin was trying to solve its problems here with our hands and our blood many of those who fought in abkhazia later died in the fighting against russian troops including the three best known chechen commanders umalt dashayev khamzat gelayev and shamil basayev in 1992 russia called us heroes but in 1994 they said we were bandits and illegal armed formations now i regret that i fought against the georgians back then
6085182 today after the two bloody wars that have rolled over chechnya i understand whats happening in georgia russian propaganda says one thing while the kremlin and the military leadership do another it was moscow that led the provocations by south ossetia against georgia and when tbilisi was forced to launch a military operation moscow immediately sent its troops onto the territory of another state and began to bomb and shell georgian cities thats real international terrorism
6085183 where the peoples of the caucasus and indeed of anywhere else are concerned russia has always stuck to one principle divide and rule whats happening in south ossetia and georgia today is a continuation of the imperial policy of enslaving peoples at the hands of their neighbours any reasonable person can understand that wars dont just happen spontaneously theyre prepared for months and sometimes even years in advance i realized that russia was preparing to wage war in georgia several years ago when the russian authorities began to hand out russian passports to the residents of abkhazia and south ossetia thats more or less the same as if the americans were to give us passports to the chechens and then announce that it was going to protect its citizens by force of arms
6085184 what russia has done in georgia is an open challenge to the entire international community
6085185 even though a peace agreement is now being signed between russia and georgia i dont have much confidence that moscow will give up so easily what it has gained after all winston churchill was right when he said that an agreement with russia is not worth the paper its written on the russian soldiers are not just going to leave georgia like that and that wasnt why moscow sent 15 000 troops there i fear that the russian military will resort to any provocation and do anything in order to unleash a full scale war the georgians must be constantly alert because they can expect a stab in the back at any moment in 1997 people also believed that the kremlin was sincere when yeltsin and maskhadov signed a peace agreement and what happened next
6085186 i have no doubt that the russian media will now do its best to create an image of georgians as enemies of russia
6085187 the kremlin will seek at any cost to overthrow the regime of mikhail saakashvili who is stubborn enough to lead his country into nato and theyll put their puppet in tbilisi and theres a suitable candidate to hand an opposition figure whos been kept warm by moscow igor giorgadze putins colleague in the kgb in my view some serious ordeals await georgia in the near future very serious ones
6085188 in this situation i find the wests position totally incomprehensible one or two calls for peace some half hearted resolutions an eagerness to persuade moscow rather than take tough measures against russia as an aggressor state
6085189 im afraid that europe has given up georgia as it did chechnya for the sake of cheap gas and oil i fully support georgia in this conflict and wish its people one thing peace
6085190 the strategic alliance with pccw global marks an important milestone for us

6085212 niameys privately owned media are being forced with increasing frequency to submit to decrees that are clearly being issued for purely political reasons
6085213 this is a disturbing development especially as the authorities no longer offer any clear explanation to the media they punish
6085214 the authorities can always brush aside our protests as coming from abroad but they cannot continue to hide behind respect for nigers sovereignty if they break their own rules

6085252 the ioc took a decision to come to beijing because opening the door and engaging is the way forward it can be a catalyst for development

6085269 we initially launched the site in order to make it easier for consumers to find the best insurance quotes available
6085270 in our rush to get the site live as soon as possible we werent able to spend a great deal of time on the design after running the site for awhile and listening to feedback from our visitors we decided we could make the site even more useful to consumers by making a few changes to the site layout and the search engine used within the site
6085271 we have also been working on creating an extensive article directory that can provide our visitors with helpful information
6085272 after conducting a little research we noticed that there wasnt a great deal of information about auto insurance available on the internet sure you can find plenty of agencies that want to sell you auto insurance but not too many of them are providing consumers with real information that will help them make more informed decisions about their coverage
6085273 o que voc est fazendo o que queria parar de fazer por qu o que gostaria de come ar a fazer a partir de agora o que gostaria de continuar a fazer
6085274 on average fuel now makes up 20 per cent of the total cost depreciation counts for between 30 and 50 per cent
6085275 the racs report shows that while the rising cost of fuel is very high on motorists minds the hidden cost of depreciation is still the biggest cost in owning and operating a vehicle
6085276 however it is very likely that fuel will continue to grow as a dominant cost of car ownership this makes a vehicles fuel consumption an even more important factor when choosing your next car
6085277 small car drivers fare better than those with people movers and 4wds while a hyundai getz costs about 120 a week to run toyota landcruiser drivers are paying more than triple those costs about 405 a week
6085278 the rac recommends that people purchase vehicles with a four or five star safety rating some of the cheaper vehicles like the hyundai i30 which costs its owner 152 a week on average to run also have a four or five star safety rating
6085279 this is a great day for us what really makes a phone is whats inside a phone

6085282 our engineers worked closely with internationals engineers to integrate the nite system into the conventional hvac system of prostar lonestar trucks
6085283 total savings in fuel costs and lower maintenance can run well over 18 000 a year
6085284 with fuel prices skyrocketing and more and more states passing idling restrictions the nite no idle system is a major advance for the trucking industry
6085285 were very pleased to work with international trucks to bring this advance to prostar lonestar owners and help them reduce their fuel usage and keep their drivers comfortable and productive
6085286 with general motors stunning second quarter record breaking loss of 15 5 billion chryslers failure to renew all of its 30 billion short term debt and ford motor co 8 7 billion loss because of a deep decline in u s sales and charges for job cuts plant closings and the falling value of trucks and sport utility vehicles the big three automakers are really taking a hit and clearly something must be done to aid american businesses

6085289 this proposal includes some very good ideas to address our countrys many energy related challenges and while i do not agree with every part of it i very much appreciate the bipartisan spirit in which it was constructed
6085290 our citizens and our government must recognize the importance of pillar industries such as the automotive industry for national strength technological expertise and economic vitality now and for future generations the automotive industry is critical to jobs in the united states north america and influences worldwide economies for every job created in the auto industry nine more are created to support it if our government invested 20 40 billion in the u s automotive industry today alternative energy for vehicles would increase dramatically and dependence on foreign oil would drastically diminish we need a distribution network for these energy alternatives and it is incumbent on the federal government to help fund and accelerate this network i believe the statistic is 49 000 fueling stations converted to accommodate alternative fueling systems such as hydrogen would supply over 80 of our needs punitive measures are not the only catalyst to increased fuel efficiency goals and diminished greenhouse gases incentives and investment will spur growth in innovative technologies much faster than avoidance of fines and special taxes
6085291 part of the reason this country has been so great is because of automotive manufacturing
6085292 it is a necessity for congress to support the american automakers their suppliers and employees
6085293 with americas workforce strained by increasing financial insecurity and rising prices we urge congress to enact comprehensive legislation to spur economic growth through tax credits and other business engage and invest in americas technology leadership its businesses

6085309 the georgian peacekeeping contingent was given the task to stop and obstruct the advancement of russian forces through the roki tunnel should they try to help the peacekeeping group
6085310 for this purpose they stockpiled arms by various means which could be used to arrange a bloodbath and obstruct the movement of any convoys in both the tunnel and the mountain pass

6085320 what has come back with a vengeance in the market is renewed concerns over financials
6085321 we still have significant problems in the financial sector when the economic situation is slowing down but inflationary pressures are significant
6085322 the outlook for equities is not particularly positive until we see some direction in terms of the financials and understand exactly where we are in terms of refinancing and recapitalization of the banks

6085343 the georgians must be constantly alert because they can expect a stab in the back at any moment in 1997 people also believed that the kremlin was sincere when yeltsin and maskhadov signed a peace agreement and what happened next
6085344 i have no doubt that the russian media will now do its best to create an image of georgians as enemies of russia
6085345 the kremlin will seek at any cost to overthrow the regime of mikhail saakashvili who is stubborn enough to lead his country into nato and theyll put their puppet in tbilisi and theres a suitable candidate to hand an opposition figure whos been kept warm by moscow igor giorgadze putins colleague in the kgb in my view some serious ordeals await georgia in the near future very serious ones

6085349 the reversal follows a month of attacks by mccain who has questioned obamas experience criticized his opposition to most new offshore oil drilling and mocked his overseas trip
6085350 the fact of the matter is at a certain point when government has not been serving the people for this long people get cynical they tune out and they start saying to themselves a plague on both your houses they are willing to consume negative information more frequently than positive information for good reason theyve seen how promises havent been kept

6085363 for a few hours or for a lifetime any time is kanye time

6085415 chevrolets goal with the new chevrolet corvette zr1 is to show what an american supercar can deliver at a price that trumps exotics that cost two three or four times as much and does so with exceptional driveability
6085416 preliminary testing shows the chevrolet corvette zr1 builds on the highly respected chevrolet corvette z06 in every performance category from acceleration and braking to cornering grip and top speed
6085417 it all boils down to the power to weight ratio and the chevrolet corvette zr1s is exceptional better than the porsche 911 gt2 the lamborghini murcielago lp640 in fact the chevrolet corvette zr1 is expected to be the first production corvette to achieve a top speed of at least 200 mph

6085434 why that didnt happen we should look closely at why thats going on
6085435 were going to try and figure out what worked at these schools and how we can apply what happened at these schools to some of the other schools
6085436 obviously well be disappointed next year and in future years if theres no increase in the number of students passing but were not discouraged at all

6085459 el capitalismo medi tico est en crisis todo lo que seamos capaces de hacer o so ar puede construir nuevas formas de comunicaci n que recuperen su sentido
6085460 esta ley refleja la peor de la dictadura pues adem s de tener varias disposiciones inconstitucionales entrega demasiados instrumentos para eludir los controles del desarrollo inmobiliario la experiencia de la organizaciones ciudadanas en este sentido es notable pues han revocado permisos ilegales a trav s de denuncias a contralor a
6085461 la reforma presentada por el gobierno es claramente deficitaria pues en estos momentos tenemos un proyecto de ley que cercena la participaci n ciudadana y su control o fiscalizaci n de los proyectos inmobiliarios
6085462 no s lo eso se ala navarro sino que otra herramienta que permitir a modificar los planes reguladores comunales e intercomunales es el de las enmiendas no se menciona en este caso la necesidad de coherencia de la enmienda con el esquema director y tampoco se considera participaci n de la comunidad
6085463 no queda claro si las zonas de desarrollo urbano condicionado que pueden establecer las municipalidades por iniciativa propia o a petici n de terceros pueden establecerse fuera de los l mites urbanos y si tendr an algunas limitaciones en cuanto a su localizaci n tambi n se dispone que los planes reguladores intercomunales pueden establecer en las reas rurales subdivisiones prediales distintas a la antes indicada de 2 h lo que deja abierta la posibilidad de urbanizar indiscriminadamente los suelos rurales comprendidos dentro de sus l mites
6085464 no solo eso sino que el proyecto del gobierno deroga el articulo 46 de la ley del sag de protecci n del suelo agr cola dejando sin informe al cambio de uso de suelo y sin la presencia de otros fiscalizadores del mundo agr cola asimismo el proyecto discrimina a los m s pobres pues dispone que las municipalidades y los servicios de vivienda y urbanizaci n podr n declarar de utilidad p blica inmuebles urbanos o conjuntos de viviendas o parte de stos cuando por sus condiciones de deterioro o de insalubridad sea necesaria su expropiaci n no ser a mejor se alar la obligaci n de estos entes de hacerse responsables de mejorar las condiciones de higiene de estos lugares en vez de arrebat rselos a los pobres para construir edificios
6085465 el actual proyecto inclusive establece derechos transables de edificaci n a efectos de compensar
6085466 aqu est en juego qu modelos de ciudad queremos hoy tenemos ciudades poblaci n disgregada socialmente con franca desigualdad comunas que soportan parques industriales enormes y contaminaci n versus comunas privilegiadas edificaciones que dejan en la oscuridad y humedad a construcciones residenciales menores desprotecci n de los cascos hist ricos cambios de usos de suelo en los cuales se entrega la mejor tierra agr cola de chile para construir vulneraci n de zonas protegidas o de relevancia ambiental
6085467 la ley de urbanismo y construcciones no puede amordazar a la ciudadan a no puede consagrar una dictadura inmobiliaria sino que por el contrario debe canalizar la participaci n ciudadana integrarla m s all del derecho a recurrir a contralor a es por eso que estoy esperanzado en que podamos lograr el xito tener una ley participativa no s lo durante su discusi n sino tambi n en su texto final

6085490 muslims have the right to accept or reject the gospel
6085491 but if saul could become paul then there is nothing and no one the holy spirit cannot reach
6085492 muslims may have questions and difficulties with christians and our faith but they dont hate us
6085493 we are sent as witnesses and not as advocates or judges the holy spirit is the one and only advocate and god is the one and only judge
6085494 it is not our duty to judge but to witness to tell truthfully what we have seen if only we can just mind our own business then the holy spirit will do the rest of it
6085495 this is the hardest thing for north americans but is easier for africans
6085496 this is spiritual business praying for ourselves praying for muslims praying that god will open up their hearts for the gospel i prayed for my uncle for 15 years and three years ago i baptized him
6085497 to be missional in the muslim world is to step up to the challenge with humility and not fear
6085498 it is to step out of our comfort zones even our churches and denominations to go wherever the spirit leads it is to step into muslim neighborhoods muslim countries and the muslim world to move into peoples cultures and learn to speak their language not force them to speak yours
6085499 watch ye stand fast in the faith quit you like men be strong let all your things be done with charity
6085500 paul exhorts us to stay alert and see those things around us
6085501 once we have obeyed the we must stand firm on that
6085502 we must do as paul did when he became a man he put away those no longer speaking thinking or acting as a child
6085503 god has a mission for us all which requires us all to be strong and of good courage
6085504 there is no room in the heart of the christian for hatred or ill will toward any man

6085508 if youre purely user generated then to be honest you may have a lot of racy content and brand advertisers are very wary and uncomfortable
6085509 we would need to do high definition to have an online subscription model
6085510 generic content is the scourge of this sector so their ability to sign up original content deals is key
6085511 its major challenge is how to increase the user experience and add user interactivity to its services a video on demand like business is not the key selling point of video sharing and user loyalty for such services is not high youku cannot effectively grow merely by adding more content it needs to think of offering more services to compete with other online video companies

6085582 really source of proof please science observation proves you wrong and a habitual chronic pathological liar as well
6085583 on june 12 1980 a third explosive eruption produced 25 feet of stratification that amazed geologists successive layers are traditionally thought to require long periods of time to form yet upwards of 100 layers accumulated mostly between the nighttime hours of 9 and 12 while a plume swiftly ascended nine miles above the mountain wave after wave of pyroclastic flows began hurtling out of the crater and down the north slope each dusting the valley below with another lamination measuring from a fraction of an inch to over a yard in thickness each took from a few seconds to a few minutes to form
6085584 geologist steven austin described these pyroclastic flows as ground hugging fluidized turbulent slurries of fine volcanic debris they moved down the mountainside at hurricane speeds and left deposits of 1000 degrees f one would expect each deposit to be homogenized amp thoroughly mixed remarkably these high velocity slurries of red hot ash and pumice separated into coarse and fine particles of perfectly defined layers such features follow laws governing flows demonstrated in laboratory sedimentation tanks
6085585 similar thin layering appears in the tapeats sandstones of the grand canyon
6085586 yup you could explain to me that you have observed first hand the layering in your septic tank too im sure there is an analogy here but it escapes me at the moment do tell what is the connection
6085587 i suppose you did read darwins radio your choice of reading materials reveals a lot dawkins specialties are fiction and fantasy not observable science his much acclaimed among fools weasel analogy was a complete fraud youre clutching at fables in a last ditch effort to avoid the conclusion that there is a god to whom you will answer one day youre not ready for that
6085588 hey bj antibiotics kill bacteria not viruses you cant kill viruses with antibiotics and viruses dont mutate in response to antibiotics theyre unaffected sheesh i would have thought you would get it the first time you were corrected your knowledge of science is pathetic and youre a very dense slow learner
6085589 so we have layer upon layer fair enough of varying thicknesses of pyroclastic flows why is that such a big deal and yet again i gave to remind you that such layers are not sedimentary
6085590 yah and bears make big potty in the woods so what are you still beating that one trick pony i regret to inform you but your hobbyhorse is dead
6085591 are you a complete freaking idjit the point is that the aggregates were not only layered but segregated according to aggregate size what you have at msh is 25 feet of finely layered segregated aggregates laid down in 3 hours not a long series of separate volcanic eruptions one ringy dingy two ringy dingy if you cant comprehend the material go back to the nursery and retrieve your binky
6085592 for anyone who just tuned in see 7 wonders of mount st helens
6085593 compare the fish pig and human embryos which animals are probably more closely related and why
6085594 they maybe layered but they formed as a result of volcanic activity so they are not sedimentary rocks sorry for shouting but hopefully it may sink in eventually
6085595 the reason it hasnt been discovered before is no right thinking paleontologist would do what mary did with her specimens we dont go to all this effort to dig this stuff out of the ground to then destroy it in acid
6085596 how many artifacts are needed to prove that man and dinosaur co existed it would seem to present a major difficulty for evolutionists to explain the representation in art or literature or in artifacts of recognizable species of dinosaurs by ancient men who supposely had never seen one alive one could surmise that perhaps they had merely come across fossils but surely they would not have had the necessary skills to assemble them and then to draw them or describe them as in life modern scientists have themselves occasionally placed the wrong heads on skeletons or combined the bones of more than one specimen this presents a problem if you believe in uniformism and evolution
6085597 actually crime is on the rise especially rape and murder it may still be low but for countries with small populations its a drastic increase on top of that scandinavia in particular norway has cultivated and spawned some powerful anti religious movements the black metal movement that grew to infamy in the 1990s hit the national newspapers with almost one hundred church burnings and espoused a venomously anti christian doctrine its adherents worshipped odin the norse gods and satan they wanted not only the continued decline of christianity but a revival of nordic paganism in addition scandinavia has a healthy population of laveyan satanists so there still religious the just don t follow the bible paganism has always been in scandinavian countries and its been on a sharp rise in the last 20 years santa clause is worshipped every year all over the world santa came from the scandinavian religions of old so there quite religious just not christian
6085598 why would i do that the bible goes all the way back to creation its not given by an angel of light
6085599 compare the fish pig and human embryos which animals are probably more closely related and why
6085600 your density amazes me both gas charged slurries which formed the msh strata and water charged slurries which formed the tapeats strata follow the same laws of physics i e they follow laws governing flows of fluidized turbulent slurries of debris demonstrated in laboratory sedimentation tanks the volcano has demonstrated that such formations can be formed rapidly a global flood would have produced tapeats in a brief time
6085601 the difference is that this demonstration of the behavior of fluidized turbulent slurries of debris at msh was a gas charged slurry while the flood was primarily a demonstration of the behavior and end results of water charged slurries on a much more massive scale the flood also involved the laying down of volcanic debris but the whole demonstration was inundated with water for a year so what happens when volcanic debris is thoroughly mixed with other types of aggregates and subjected to the conditions that have already been demonstrated in laboratory sedimentation tanks hm m m m would you not get the rapid formation of a great number of segregated layers of sedimentary rock in a very short period of time good grief man the ancient romans used volcanic sand and ash to make concrete doesnt that tell you anything
6085602 you also said they were living matter which they are not now that is an interesting hypothesis viruses which are not alive mutate therefore proving evolution in living things somebody help me with this i swear that somewhere i read that the flatworm was evolving faster than the human my thought then why are they still flatworms

6085604 how many artifacts are needed to prove that man and dinosaur co existed it would seem to present a major difficulty for evolutionists to explain the representation in art or literature or in artifacts of recognizable species of dinosaurs by ancient men who supposely had never seen one alive
6085605 one could surmise that perhaps they had merely come across fossils but surely they would not have had the necessary skills to assemble them and then to draw them or describe them as in life
6085606 modern scientists have themselves occasionally placed the wrong heads on skeletons or combined the bones of more than one specimen
6085607 the reason it hasnt been discovered before is no right thinking paleontologist would do what mary did with her specimens we dont go to all this effort to dig this stuff out of the ground to then destroy it in acid
6085608 no the simple answer is that the drawings are based upon fear of the afterlife and legend

6085627 there is a great wealth of uk automotive engineering ingenuity and innovation that can lead the world in the newly emerging zero emission vehicle space
6085628 here is the proof that when it comes to building compact sports utility vehicles land rover cannot be matched not only is the freelander 2 as capable on the road as it is off it the upmarket 4x4 is as refined as some of the best limousines generously equipped and tastefully appointed the car offers an unrivalled blend of versatility and drivability
6085629 the discovery 3 is the most distinctively styled and best loved premium off roader money can buy the seven seat interior is not just huge but hugely adjustable its air suspension and terrain response allow drivers to reach all but the most inaccessible locations as at home on the m25 as it is in the serengeti desert no other car offers such wide ranging ability
6085630 we are absolutely delighted to win these awards from auto express for both the freelander 2 and the discovery 3 for the second consecutive year
6085631 both vehicles continue to receive widespread acclaim across the board which is a testament to their design versatility capability and continued desirability
6085632 i am pleased to hand over the chief executive title to charles who has steadily proven his ability to lead this company to fulfill its potential as a world industry leader
6085633 the market opportunity has grown tremendously in business scale and complexity over the years and we are now prepared to take full advantage of it

6085635 it is clear that energy storage will be crucial in solving the worlds energy problems the lithium ion battery will almost certainly play a central role in the first and possibly most significant hurdle to achieving that goal the electrification of the automobile industry
6085636 fuel cells and nanotechnology are crucial components in the later stages of electrification of the automotive industry

6085639 the new prime minister yousuf raza gilani who was in washington this week to meet president bush says he is doing his best to convince his country that this is pakistans war but he seems not to have won the argument within his own government
6085640 this complex situation calls for a careful and flexible response from the united states and to its credit the outgoing bush administration is making a relatively good start at fashioning that response
6085641 gillani on his first official us visit since being elected in february was left in no doubt that the bush administration had lost patience with the isis alleged double game
6085642 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
6085643 the fact that we have young people over there who have u s passports is of tremendous concern because of their ability to come back into the united states
6085644 we have previously said that increased activity in the pakistani tribal areas gives us some reason for concern
6085645 we have also previously talked about our concerns that al qaida is seeking to recruit western looking sympathizers with no criminal records who could more easily blend in and attempt to travel to the united states
6085646 no credible information at this time to suggest an imminent threat to the homeland or u s interests at the olympics
6085647 i understand there is a problem of extremism at some madrassas
6085648 but to put everyone under this broad net of suspicion is beginning to infringe on peoples civil liberties
6085649 michael mccauls failed publicity stunt shows it is past time for new leadership in texas 10th congressional district
6085650 a nice sound bite that trivializes a very serious issue for this country
6085651 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
6085652 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held
6085653 it was sort of this aha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof
6085654 and asked about leaked information that tipped militants to surveillance efforts by western intelligence services
6085655 thats probably something the government of pakistan ought to speak to
6085656 we and some of our allies have evidence not only from the scene of the explosion but evidence beyond it that unfortunately indicate a hand like that
6085657 we are fairly confident of what you are talking about
6085658 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
6085659 strong evidence and circumstantial evidence of american acquiescence to terrorism inside pakistan
6085660 carrying what were seen as india influenced intelligence inputs had hardened the resolve of pakistans security establishment to keep supreme pakistans national security interest even if it meant straining ties with the us and nato
6085661 not to distinguish between a terrorist for the united states and afghanistan and a terrorist for pakistan
6085662 for reasons best known to langley the cia headquarters as well as the pentagon pakistani officials say the americans were not interested in disrupting the kabul based fountainhead of terrorism in balochistan nor do they want to allocate the marvellous predator unmanned armed aerial combat vehicle resource to neutralise the kingpin of suicide bombings against the pakistani military establishment now hiding near the pakistan afghan border
6085663 pakistans enemy number one and the mastermind of almost every suicide operation against the pakistan army and the isi since june 2006
6085664 the united states military has the capacity to direct a missile to a precise location at very short notice as it has done close to 20 times in the last few years to hit al qaeda targets inside pakistan
6085665 have long been intrigued by the presence of highly encrypted communications gear with mehsud this communication gear enables him to collect real time information on pakistani troop movements from an unidentified foreign source without being intercepted by pakistani intelligence
6085666 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
6085667 there is a cold war between india and pakistan they say hands off kashmir we say hands off afghanistan
6085668 there is just enough pakistan co operation with the us to get away with it
6085669 but the us agenda is not innocent either they desire a larger role for themselves in the muslim world
6085670 the isi is going to determine the destiny of pakistan perhaps in the near future
6085671 during the afghan jihad so many things were created by pakistan now these elements are out of control
6085672 the indian statement is not only surprising but shocking too
6085673 some rogue elements in the isi are working against the interest of the country they are being funded by a terror sponsor state the us
6085674 anytime the supreme court called the interior ministry or the defense ministry they could not get the isi into the court
6085675 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
6085676 we have received information that nearly 800 militants are waiting to cross over to india at the borders
6085677 the wired fencing at border areas is being further strengthened
6085678 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
6085679 mullah rahmatullah tried to show that the afghan government is weak in kandahar
6085680 after the arrest mullah rahmatullah confessed to his crimes and said he received orders and money for all terroristic activities and for the kidnappings from one of the members of pakistans consulate in kandahar
6085681 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
6085682 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
6085683 what the deputies committee has raised is given the possibility that political fragmentation in pakistan is going to continue do we need to change our strategy
6085684 the argument that we may destabilize pakistan has taken us to where we are right now
6085685 pursuing the policy of public praise and private pressure on pakistan doesnt work
6085686 we need to enhance the capacity of hitting these targets
6085687 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
6085688 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
6085689 the only result of the use of airstrikes is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism
6085690 abandon the idea that the afghan government will be under its control
6085691 we do not want to be the slaves or puppets of other countries
6085692 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
6085693 you are butchers liars and hypocrites you keep on talking about terrorism to the media but behind closed doors you support terrorism
6085694 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
6085695 this particular air force exercise is important because india is included among some very important allies
6085696 this is definitely an extension of an arc that has been mapped out since 2000 and it really signifies that what india and the united states have is a strategic relationship
6085697 the united states is very keen that india become important
6085698 indias going to be doing what it wants to do in the area that china thinks is important and a more capable strong india will be able to prevent chinese hegemony more so than a weak india
6085699 we will learn how our allies operate in response to similar threats
6085700 it will allow us to build observations to eventually learn those lessons about what it takes to integrate talk fly with employ deploy and sustain air power with places like india korea and france
6085701 pyongyang through its state run news agency the korean central news agency has consistently and passionately criticized such ventures accusing the united states of harboring hostile intentions toward north korea
6085702 beijing would likely remain reticent about such training since it does not see itself as directly and imminently affected by such activities
6085703 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
6085704 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
6085705 the only result of the use of airstrikes is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism
6085706 abandon the idea that the afghan government will be under its control
6085707 we do not want to be the slaves or puppets of other countries
6085708 this is not true we have no reports of missiles being fired into pakistan
6085709 it is not clear whether wazir survived the attack or not but his brother abdur rehman and one of their close relatives abdul salam were killed in the strike
6085710 they were three men who suddenly stood up during the meeting and one of them opened fire on him
6085711 if these kinds of operations continue against us in swat and in the tribal areas we will continue this
6085712 it is our firm resolve that we will root out terrorism from pakistan and all of our security agencies are working together to achieve this goal
6085713 reiterated the resolve of the nation to remain determined and not yield to pressures created by such heinous crimes
6085714 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
6085715 were being told by western envoys that its not going to bring more stability to have a long trial and that it is in the interests of stability for him to exit
6085716 we are very clear that we have no role to play in this impeachment process britain has no interest in talking about the fate of individuals
6085717 there is a link between musharraf and the army so humiliating him is like humiliating the army
6085718 the us administration would have much preferred to see a workable political arrangement between musharraf and the government not another looming transition
6085719 whoever abrogates the constitution must be punished or we will never stop these dictators usurping power here
6085720 this is a man who stood up against al qaida who will face al qaida after musharraf certainly not this coalition
6085721 the anti terrorist squad of uttar pradesh has arrested one isi agent of pakistan from rupaideeha in bahraich district we have come to know that his name is mohamad masrur alias manzoor ansari who is son of noor muhammad he is native of 154 4 garden west adul jabbar compound near nazeer hotel karachi
6085722 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
6085723 extremists wanted to establish their hold in bajaur and the government had to take action
6085724 until today 462 militants have been killed in bajaur and a similar number have been injured twenty two troops have been killed and some are missing in action
6085725 whether i win or lose the impeachment the nation will lose
6085726 they dont realize they can succeed against me but the country will undergo irreparable damage
6085727 i will live and die in pakistan there is no other way
6085728 historians will not forgive musharraf he manipulated elections he hounded his opponents and he became a dictator its not much of a legacy
6085729 there will be a more balanced view of him in the future than there is now
6085730 a lot of things happened in pakistan for the good under his watch and i think that is something the history books will recall after some time
6085731 as far as democracy in pakistan is concerned historians will not forgive him
6085732 he manipulated elections he hounded his opponents and he became a dictator its not much of a legacy
6085733 he never tried to create an impression in pakistan that we were fighting for our own country and our own good
6085734 and because of that the pakistan army became a client army and pakistan became a client state in the eyes of the people it was a major failing on his part
6085735 he didnt understand that a country of 160 million people couldnt be ruled by just one man
6085736 at the moment i can say that 25 people have died in the attack
6085737 there is no deal with the president and he had himself resigned
6085738 the coalition will now have to apply themselves because they will have no excuse
6085739 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one

6085983 we built the primary course at the diggingsafely com site
6085984 based on the underground damage prevention best practices of the common ground alliance a national coalition of electric gas water cable telecommunications and rail companies don szambelan our chief learning officer and his team then offered to customize the course on a state by state basis missouri was the first to step up they wanted missouri specific information on regulations and procedures as well as excavation safety training other state one call systems are interested and we look forward to working with them damage prevention is in everyones interest

6085989 often referred to as intrinsically safe lights fluorescent lights are popular in paint spray booths because fluorescent lights provide even lighting and more consistent true color
6085990 while our explosion proof fluorescent lights continue to be popular with oil rigs and aerospace companies as surface mount lights we have seen more and more paint booth operators working to bring their shops compliant with osha requirements we offer explosion proof fluorescent lights that can be mounted on the ceiling or on carts with wheels in this way the operators can either work with overhead lighting or position these hazardous location fluorescent lights to illuminate specific portions of the painted pieces
6085991 we think we offer one of the best values in the industry our explosion proof paint spray booth lights are certified to ul 844 for hazardous locations ul 595 and 1598 as waterproof lights for marine and saltwater applications and ul 924 which covers the use of these intrinsically safe lights as emergency lights we have recently added a second ballast to our existing fluorescent fixtures that enables them to operate not only as a work area light in the paint spray booth but also offer 90 minutes of emergency lighting in the event of power loss our explosion proof fluorescent light offers dual duty as a functional work light and an explosion proof emergency light saving the paint spray booth operator or the oilfield operator money both in fixtures and installation costs while meeting all the osha requirements for hazardous location lighting to top it off we offer these fixtures made right here in texas under 1000 each and usually with less than 2 weeks lead time
6085992 we really have worked to become a one stop shop for plant maintenance workers oil field operators paint spray booth operators and shipyards who need a variety of explosion proof surface mount and portable lighting

6086000 our programming students have found the curlwbt to be a very useful tool as it provides them with easy real time access to knowledge of the curl language and platform
6086001 while we have discovered that the students already familiar with java find it easy to learn curl the web based training courses make that process even simpler and faster
6086002 the curlwbt was created to provide developers with the necessary tools to get up to speed on the curl language and technology as quickly as possible
6086003 we are excited to make this available to the entire curl developer community as it really showcases how easily curl can be used to build enterprise class rich internet applications
6086004 we are right on track with where we were last year with occupancy and left to lease even our down markets were not as down in the second quarter this year as those of our competitors
6086005 effective revenue management strategy backed up by a solid system forces a management process that prevents over correcting in leaner times it has helped us in boom times too when managers might have been content with good occupancy and perhaps were slow to push rents higher
6086006 the b product is still a fairly safe place to be even though were seeing rent growth flatten in some markets
6086007 we are carefully watching all our markets continuing to do acquisitions and working to maximize occupancy and maximize revenue
6086008 an important value of using lease rent optimization technology is that it requires we track competitors and watch our renewals more carefully so we can generate daily rents more in tune with our markets it also stabilizes our renewal pace
6086009 people mistakenly believe that when you implement a revenue management system you flip a few switches and everyone turns off their brains
6086010 laramars pricing optimization system requires that our entire team be more engaged with the market and our strategies on a daily basis
6086011 we track our results every year against industry advisers reit indexes and have consistently beat the reit revenue growth numbers every year
6086012 i attribute that almost 100 percent to the lro system we were 80 percent committed to it when we did the system pilot test study and we are 110 percent committed to it now lease rent optimization technology is an integral part of our business practices regardless of market conditions

6086031 i think it would have messed up my mind completely if shed done that from the next lane to me
6086032 i watched a recording and i realised i was quite far down coming out of the bend if id known that while i was running i think i think i would have panicked a bit but sanya panicked and thats why she tensed up its the worst thing you can do in a race

6086174 things were running much better in the old days before pat took over
6086175 its very funny and irreverent and gets people to laugh
6086176 once we get people to laugh theyre more receptive to the message
6086177 id say this is the most fundamental change weve made ever to the marketplace
6086178 buyers increasingly want the convenience of shopping for great value often new items at a fixed price this is fuelling a big growth in the number of large and small sellers using ebay in this way
6086179 todays improvements will remove barriers for sellers so they can make the most of this opportunity and offer even more goods for sale on ebay
6086180 there is an absolute recognition for years and years and years that there has been a labour crisis and a shortage in this electorate
6086181 none of the endeavours that have been put in place have resolved it my growers deserve a fair go
6086182 you simply cannot live in a city electorate and make these decisions
6086183 its clearly been identified that there is a gap and we need to fill that
6086184 what brendan nelson doesnt understand is we have fruit rotting on the vine we are actually talking about a serious labor shortage
6086185 these are not full time jobs these are seasonal jobs and if to some limited extent we can help australias farmers with seasonal labour then its a sensible thing to do

6086216 what i am concerned about is whoever the individual sex offender is that we have in place the necessary provisions to monitor them
6086217 no paedophile is a celebrity every paedophile needs to be controlled
6086218 pretty hard to imagine it would be legitimate for him to travel abroad again
6086219 i think its right that we use police time to monitor sex offenders
6086220 if you are a british citizen you have the right to use the nhs whatever we think about an individual and this is a pretty despicable person
6086221 he glitter decides where he applies to go and the country or authorities there will decide whether they permit him to enter their territory
6086222 it makes you sick he doesnt even want to live here hes just coming to sponge off us i can think of a lot more worthy people to give treatment to on the nhs
6086223 hes an exploiter he exploits children hell exploit the nhs

6086228 el gobierno liban s debe entender que a partir del momento en que le otorga una legitimidad al hezbol todo el estado liban s ser un blanco de la misma manera que todo israel constituye un blanco para el hezbol

6086271 hablar de la homil a por tanto significar ser conscientes de que est hecha de complejidad y de belleza aunque haya sido marginada maltratada a veces complicada o clericalizada o a veces sugestiva y acertada la homil a representa en cualquier caso un verdadero eje esencial e irrenunciable de la liturgia

6086276 que el predicador hable muy muy clarito para que el que escucha se vaya contento e iluminado y no deslumbrado
6086277 la diferencia entre un pastor y un actor es precisamente el momento existencial que el pastor sea pobre cuando predica la pobreza que sea escarnecido cuando exhorta a soportar el escarnio mientras que el actor tiene la tarea de enga ar eliminando el momento existencial el predicador tiene precisamente el deber en el sentido m s profundo de predicar con su propia vida

6086289 the larger players whose performance has been spotty over the last year or two put a chill on the industry which caused many strategic buyers to wait on the sidelines
6086290 that opened a window of opportunity for us weve benefitted greatly from the heightened anxiety of the economic climate
6086291 some of the big guys are still struggling not all of them
6086292 level 3 went through some major struggles about 6 months ago that put a damper on everyones valuation xo global crossing and cogent have their own separate issues paetec had a big scare those events extend the window for us the big rbocs are really focused on wireless opportunities so theyre not really looking at fiber assets so if there are opportunities to buy companies theres a little less competition than there will be a few years from now
6086293 the key thing here is that this is another datapoint a confirmation point of what we have been doing for quite some time whether on the consumer side or the business side
6086294 our dominance in recent years has been in tier 3 clecs and ilecs and iocs but we have always served tier 1s like bt and at amp t and qwest and we will continue to be doing this we hope to continue growing this business
6086295 this is for any enterprise customer but there is a sweet spot with a huge number of businesses that may need 10 24 lines but dont want to have to invest in in house technology and the tech staff to run those systems

6086308 what was supposed to be a liquid asset becomes a ball and chain around your neck when you owe more than the market value of the property
6086309 we along with many top dermatologists and research scientists are highly critical of the study
6086310 some researchers have called the report bordering on irresponsibility we concur
6086311 it is interesting and it is worth further investigation but i would not advise your readers to change their lives chances are this will be an alternative explanation for a weird result
6086312 our study was sent to the top dermatology journal and was only published after receiving critical peer review i believe the data and statistical analyses are sound
6086313 our paper was not meant to be alarming although some members of the press have made alarming statements
6086314 it is sort of interesting data but has to interpret with caution to make it any application to humans
6086315 this is very restricted animal model that doesnt necessarily equate to humans
6086316 obviously we can all remember flooding here before but never in august
6086317 for some people this is the third time this ye ar they have been flooded and i feel terrible sympathy for the people whose homes and businesses ha ve been destroyed
6086318 the town has been given ap proval of 20m for flood relief an d a main dr ainage sc heme but we are still waiting on the go ahead to carry out this work this is urgently needed it ca nt go on where people are flooded so often
6086319 i do have to compliment the ci vil defence and the council workers wh o have been out her e all weekend from early morning till late at night he lping people they are doing an excellent job in terrible circumstances

6086328 the cold reality of climate change had come as a shock to local residents
6086329 extreme weather conditions such as the mass flooding weve seen in carlow town limerick dublin and in belfast can almost certainly be related to the changing weather patterns as predicted by climate change experts
6086330 it is not until these weather conditions actually strike that people realise the devastating effects that climate change will bring
6086331 it is up to local authorities to assess their flood risks to put flood management plans in place and prevent development on any flood plains it is up to local politicians to ensure the proper legislation is in place to account for this
6086332 it is important that all political representatives particularly at local levels get behind the planning guidelines in place
6086333 the river really started to overflow at 5am on sunday morning but flooding was prevented
6086334 we got extra equipment to back up the pumps and with the help of council workers and locals we were able to prevent flooding
6086335 when i woke up on saturday i looked out my back garden and there was two foot of water making its way towards my house
6086336 i want to publicly acknowledge the work done by the civil defence the garda and the fire service for the efforts they put in
6086337 very successful weekend in terms of the response by the emergency services
6086338 con cerned of the risks to the people living in the apartment blocks the esb did their assessment and we knew it was a rescue issue at that point there is an obvious danger when the cables get wet
6086339 practically at the contract award stage at the moment we will hopefully have an answer within the week
6086340 con tract is ready to go a lot of the work which needs to be done is weather dependent and should be done within the summer months
6086341 im glad the minister was here it is always nice to have them standing next to pools of water looking at them but if that is all that happens id be worried

6086343 iraq will supply lebanon with crude oil according to a bilateral agreement that will be signed by the related ministers from the two countries
6086344 it just started to snowball and we got momentum and it took a lot of hard work lot of phone calls lot of foot work but its been worth it so far because we got it off the ground
6086345 the strength i find is the fact this is a missing part of my life and i need to find my daughter and this is our job now if you have no other job for the rest of your life your job is to find that child that is missing
6086346 prior to the playing card program being implemented we had virtually no calls coming from correctional facilities
6086347 we now have 40 50 calls per month coming in
6086348 the people that are here live out on the streets they grew up out on the streets they know whats going on
6086349 sooner or later someone will hear someone talks it always happens whether its two days from now or five years from now
6086350 murders a big issue and kidnapping you know even though were on this side of the fence most of us dont like those things
6086351 we have a very high turnover which is very good cause we keep on getting different people in here all the time that would give some fresh ideas fresh information
6086352 we havent had anything to date but we have our fingers crossed everyday
6086353 you got better things to do guys im not the guy
6086354 t here are no military installations in the city of tskhinvali
6086355 the attack was short sharp and deadly enough to send the georgians fleeing in humiliating panic
6086356 the western media especially cnn is feeding you complete horseshit russia did not invade georgia first
6086357 missile defense washington and poland just moved the world closer to war
6086358 the signing now insures an escalation of tensions between russia and nato and a new cold war arms race in full force it is important for readers to understand the ability of one of two opposing sides to put anti missile missiles to within 90 miles of the territory of the other in even a primitive first generation anti missile missile array gives that side virtual victory in a nuclear balance of power and forces the other to consider unconditional surrender or to preemptively react by launching its nuclear strike before 2012
6086359 this decision clearly demonstrates everything we have said recently the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe is aimed at the russian federation
6086360 us troops on monday july 14 began military exercises near the russian border in ex soviet ukraine and were poised to launch them in georgia amid tense relations between moscow and washington a ceremony inaugurating the sea breeze 2008 nato exercise was held off ukraines black sea coast against anti nato protests and a hostile reaction from officials in russia sea breeze 2008 includes forces from armenia azerbaijan belgium britain canada denmark france georgia germany greece latvia macedonia and turkey the us georgia joint exercises will be held at the vaziani military base less than 100 kilometers 60 miles from the russian border with a total of 1 650 servicemen taking part
6086361 this is a formula for an injection of us military and naval forces into georgia of indeterminate scope and duration it will certainly involve the presence of hundreds if not thousands of uniformed us military personnel on the ground and a substantial number of warships in the region the us is introducing this military force into a situation that remains highly unstable and combustible raising the possibility of a direct military clash between the united states and russia
6086362 its near impossible to overstate exiles importance as an astonishingly honest influential genre busting exercise
6086363 every time i see your face i think of things unpure unchaste i want to fuck you like a dog ill take you home and make you like it
6086364 be yourself because if you can get away with it that is the ultimate feminist act
6086365 the album made it ok for us girls to talk explicitly about sexuality in terms that only guys were allowed to use and it made it fine to acknowledge both the vulnerability as well as the fun and vulgar aspects of sexuality even if it was in the form of singing along
6086366 yes i wore a slinky red thing does that mean i should spread for you your friends your father mr ed

6086368 king grew up writing the boy centric songs in the brill building the new york office building famously used by music publishers and writers
6086369 with the exception of youre so vain which is about the peacockery of maledom her early records are very loving
6086370 but her songs were not especially saucer eyed theyre very realistic and mature
6086371 the same could be said of laura nyro and judee sill the language they use doesnt have the rage of alanis or liz phair or pj harvey but theres still some of that matching of rage to articulacy and thats unusual in pop
6086372 you could not play that on the radio now its incredibly filthy so its not as if it hadnt been expressed before liz phair
6086373 a lot of pop music is sold on its candour but its rarely as candid as guyville it opened up the expressive vocabulary for female artists
6086374 women dont have that long history of songwriting they cant refer to past examples which is why they go into themselves drawing on themselves
6086375 frequently almost tactical part of seduction its confession with a point
6086376 is not there to impress or to seduce its not a dance move
6086377 it wasnt written to elicit a response from this person or to seek any sort of revenge it was to unburden myself with my now allowing myself to just admit how i felt and in admitting how i felt by singing it so many times i kind of transcended it really i was able to admit all of this and to go forth from there instead of getting stuck
6086378 stand 6ft 1in instead of 5ft 2in and thats quite an achievement
6086379 le peuple dabkhazie a lintention de demander la direction russe de reconna tre labkhazie
6086380 but we spend an awful lot of our twenties defining ourselves with our jobs with our relationships when we reach 27 weve been trying so hard to reach certain goals fame money success that we might suddenly realise for the first time that were not that happy after all and we are supposed to be grown up and responsible and we dont feel ready
6086381 but you also need to be what americans refer to as a heritage artist
6086382 someone whos made a real difference to rocknroll hendrix joplin the doors nirvana the stones these are all bands and individuals whose music was truly great and they never got to finish who knows what they would have gone on to produce if they were alive today
6086383 i took this in a park in madrid kurt had no energy no interest in anything it was funny because dave grohl and krist novoselic were the nicest guys you could ever hope to meet but kurt just seemed frustrated courtney love his wife had come to meet him on tour and she loved being the centre of attention it was a nightmare to take the picture i had to wait around for hours and the pr kept ringing up to say kurt and courtney were still holed up in their hotel room id spent days on the road with nirvana in the us when the first album came out in 1989 back then kurt had been much more engaging none of them was doing drugs as much i guess he became disenchanted with the music industry the tours all the promotional stuff he just wanted to be in a little punk rock band
6086384 the rolling stones were the first big band i ever photographed this is the first time they were on television in july 1963 when they were plugging their first record i was 22 and had been working for tatler taking pictures of debutantes which i was delighted to be away from brian had his little gang of groupies and hes signing autographs for them here in those days when they were building the group they were nice to everybody we used to go out after gigs and id buy them chickens from the barbecue on the kings road as there wasnt any mcdonalds back then it was only later that they really started doing drugs i reckoned brian only did them because he was miserable with what was going on in the group he was the leader really but there was so much infighting to get rid of him particularly from mick and keith without him though the stones would never have existed
6086385 in this picture janis is reading a comic on the plane to a gig in detroit she didnt always read comics though she was very literate she was one of the few performers i got to know personally while i was photographing in new york i found her to be loving considerate and lonely she seemed to experience pain even when she was having pleasure that she couldnt get as high in real life as she did from her performances saddened and depressed her one night after a big show in new york i shared a cab with her and a few other members of the band she directed the cab to drive to the home of a casual friend who she hoped was there when she got out she shook her head and with a sad smile said man what a drag here i am a big star and i cant find anyone to be with

6086498 americas future leaders must always remember that the war on terror will be won on the offense and that is where americas military must stay
6086499 cannot be won however if we treat terrorism primarily as a matter of law enforcement law enforcement is an essential part of our strategy but our strategy cannot be limited to law enforcement alone
6086500 but eight years later al qaeda terrorists came back to finish the job
6086501 what we know is that in previous terrorist attacks for example the first attack against the world trade center we were able to arrest those responsible put them on trial they are currently in u s prisons incapacitated
6086502 and the fact that the administration has not tried to do that has created a situation where not only have we never actually put many of these folks on trial but we have destroyed our credibility when it comes to rule of law all around the world and given a huge boost to terrorist recruitment in countries that say
6086503 we could have done the exact same thing but done it in a way that was consistent with our laws

6086519 i would not have nominated uhhh clarence thomas uh i dont think that uhhh i i i i i i dont think that he was an exper uh a strong enough jurist or legal thinker uh at the time uh for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of a lot of the constitution
6086520 barack obama is a leader that god has blessed us with at this time
6086521 i believe there are a lot of supporters for hillary among the superdelegates especially now that theyve agreed to place her name in nomination i think half the house democrats would probably be hillary supporters especially women i felt she was the most experienced and the best candidate and i still feel that way
6086522 it would be nice to think that after eight years of economic disaster after eight years of bungled foreign policy of being engaged in a war that should never have been authorized and should never have been waged that cost us a trillion dollars and thousands of lives that people would say lets toss the bums out toss the bums out were starting from scratch were starting over this is not working
6086523 republicans say this other guy is unpatriotic or this guy likes french people thats what they said about 2004 demo presidential contender john kerry they try to make it out like democrats arent tough enough arent macho enough
6086524 barack obama likes to portray himself as a centrist politician who wants to unite the country but occasionally his postpartisan mask slips that was the case at saturday nights saddleback church forum when mr obama chose to demean supreme court justice clarence thomas pastor rick warren asked each presidential candidate which justices he would not have nominated mr mccain said with all due respect the four most liberal sitting justices because of his different judicial philosophy mr obama took a lower road replying first that thats a good one and then adding that i would not have nominated clarence thomas i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of a lot of the constitution the democrat added that he also wouldnt have appointed antonin scalia and perhaps not john roberts though he assured the audience that at least they were smart enough for the job so lets see by the time he was nominated clarence thomas had worked in the missouri attorney generals office served as an assistant secretary of education run the equal employment opportunity commission and sat for a year on the d c circuit court of appeals the nations second most prominent court since his elevation to the high court in 1991 he has also shown himself to be a principled and scholarly jurist meanwhile as he bids to be americas commander in chief mr obama isnt yet four years out of the illinois state senate has never held a hearing of note of his u s senate subcommittee and had an unremarkable record as both a community organizer and law school lecturer justice thomass judicial credentials compare favorably to mr obamas presidential r sum by any measure and when it comes to rising from difficult circumstances justice thomass rural georgian upbringing makes mr obamas story look like easy street even more troubling is what the illinois democrats answer betrays about his political habits of mind asked a question he didnt expect at a rare unscripted event the rookie candidate didnt merely say he disagreed with justice thomas instead he instinctively reverted to the leftwing clich that the courts black conservative isnt up to the job while his white conservative colleagues are so much for civility in politics and bringing people together and no wonder mr obamas advisers have refused invitations for more such open forums preferring to keep him in front of a teleprompter where he wont let slip what he really believes
6086525 the principle of government control over information is inseparable from the principle of government control over peoples lives
6086526 nothing doth more hurt in a state than that cunning men pass for wise
6086527 when asked what americas greatest moral failing was theological obama said it was our collective failure to abide by that basic precept in the book of matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me for obama the politician such scriptural quotations often serve as an all inclusive writ to impose his religious views on others when it comes to fighting poverty global warming racism etc but when the question turns to abortion political obama insists on a policy of moral agnosticism and political laissez faire
6086528 obama is the only elected official on record to ever vote in favor of denying life saving medical care to children who had been born but that were struggling for life is that a decision too confusing so as to be above the pay grade as well
6086529 it is now clear why barack obama has refused john mccains offer of joint town hall appearances during the fall campaign mccain is obviously better at them

6086536 no one is trying to isolate russia its russias actions that are isolating it and so we will see over the next several days whether russia begins to act in a responsible and appropriate fashion but right now the key point that the entire international community has to make is if you make a pledge you keep your pledge and russia made a pledge to withdraw its forces when the ceasefire agreement was signed president medvedev first said that he was going to do it some almost seven or eight days ago then it was going to be three days ago then it was going to be yesterday and it just isnt happening and so the question for russia is why is the russian presidents word not good

6086541 what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
6086542 we arrived at saddleback and went into a holding room which is a separate building from the main church in the room there were four or five staff people plus mccain and there was no tv no audio no nothing we talked through a few of the topics we had spent time in the afternoon preparing doing q amp a and we did a few more questions to warm him up at about ten til six the advance guys came to get mccain to take him to the stage because the handshake with obama was a few minutes before 6 p m mccain never heard any of this stuff
6086543 mccain says heres my plan im going to drill here drill now which is something he only came up with two months ago when he started looking at polling

6086875 with the release of gilad shalit safe and sound and his return to his family the israeli government would be willing to release many palestinian prisoners including those sentenced for long period of time
6086876 there will be no progress on the issue of the palestinian prisoners as long as gilad shalit does not return in addition there is no sensational development on the shalit issue
6086877 prime minister olmert i think has through this speech and through his remarks demonstrated that he is truly interested in the dialogue that would lead to a two state solution israel and palestine living side by side in peace
6086878 but again before you get to that point there are obstacles there are obstacles that need to be overcome
6086879 one of them certainly is a hamas led government that has not met the quartet conditions for realizing a political dialogue that eventually leads to a two state solution
6086880 another obstacle are those rejectionist groups who would use violence who try to derail any sort of hopeful developments or potentially hopeful development

6086957 if you remove our cables you had better move all the power from the area no one can have it if we are not allowed to have electricity
6086958 there is generally rampant theft of electricity and illegal connections in the sea cow lake area as fast as we replace these cables they are stolen again but unless we police 24 hours a day it will happen wherever there are informal settlements where poor people have not been provided with electricity the temptation to connect illegally is often too great for some
6086959 ultimately the only way to solve electricity theft is to provide everyone with power in their homes but we are improving our patrols and will definitely not sit on our hands and do nothing but unfortunately as cape town has success with these gangs they will move up the coast and as we have success they will move to other areas arrests are the only way of stopping it we will definitely curb it

6086992 im the healthiest ive been all my life my diet has a lot to do with my getting into shape i have no sugar i dont eat fruit or even fruit juice because of the sugar i eat chicken and salmon and rice i eat avocados ill have egg whites for breakfast and sometimes turkey burgers for lunch i try to do just 1 200 calories a day it may sound like its not much but its actually a lot of food if you eat the right things

6086996 most of the counterfeits in tanzania use brand names they are also sub standard in quality
6086997 serious safety consequences for consumers hurt the economy and prevent the local manufacturing industry from growing
6086998 the worst part is you buy it cheap but actually its expensive because you pay for it several times over after it breaks
6086999 china remains the single largest source of fake products found in global markets
6087000 we want to send a message that tanzania is no longer a dumping ground for counterfeits
6087001 we are encouraging consumers to use their power like voting if they vote not to buy the goods then businesses will stop selling them
6087002 do you know who you are f with we are the police
6087003 by outlining specific barriers to use in this population we provide a framework for future early interventions such as parent education and addressing confidentiality concerns
6087004 multiple misconceptions such as side effects that are not known to occur and concerns about confidentiality exist in this population and may influence future use

6087007 electrical energy storage is very important for all electrical and electronic systems
6087008 even renewable energy systems like solar cells need somewhere to store excess energy to be used at night
6087009 traditional materials are ceramic materials which have high weight and are very fragile
6087010 matching the permittivity and uniformly dispersing the ceramic nanoparticles is not easy
6087011 both problems have to be tackled and solved at the same time for the material to have the desired characteristics
6087012 we studied the properties of disease causing viruses that evolved to infect mucosal surfaces to engineer a coating that enables our drug delivery particles to penetrate mucus layers in minutes in our new work we have improved the coatings considerably to allow faster penetration for a wider array of particle sizes
6087013 for example we constantly inhale particles into our lungs but they typically stick to mucus rather than penetrate it particles that stick are removed rapidly from the lungs on a mucus conveyor belt and are swallowed and sterilized in the gut mucus barriers protect us from constant infection as well as everyday things like the millions of particles in the black cloud emitted from a bus when it takes off from a stop
6087014 if a particle is small enough and not adhesive then it can get through the mucus net thats how some viruses penetrate mucus barriers
6087015 peg is one of the most widely used polymers for therapeutic applications
6087016 for example cervical cancer patients could locally apply chemo drugs inside mucus penetrating particles which would then deliver the drug locally in the female reproductive tract at efficient concentrations over prolonged periods of time instead of delivering it everywhere else in the body that could drastically reduce the side effects as well as prolong the presence of drugs at the target site
6087017 reproductive dysfunctions include a range of menstrual disorders sexual dysfunctions and pregnancy complications that include spontaneous abortion or miscarriage
6087018 teenagers who drink tend to have disruptions in their menstrual cycle as well as unplanned pregnancies
6087019 higher rates of reproductive dysfunction in adult women may reflect the cumulative effects of longer exposure to alcohol for older women than for female adolescents
6087020 to our knowledge this is the first study to examine alcohols effects on reproductive onset across reproductive development
6087021 most previous research has examined risks to teens or adults but not both our findings highlight a risk associated with ad in women that is not widely recognized a risk that has assumed increasing importance given the increased rates of alcohol misuse by women and particularly young women
6087022 young women who drink alcohol may want to consider the longer term consequences for later childbearing
6087023 if drinking continues or increases to levels of problem use their ability and or opportunity to have children may be impaired
6087024 for women who are already experiencing fertility problems or other reproductive difficulties
6087025 the studys findings should warn them not to use alcohol to cope with stress caused by the reproductive problems because alcohol would likely make the reproductive problems worse as well as carrying risks of possible alcohol abuse or dependence
6087026 preventing misdiagnosis of women is a crucial resource for all therapists who treat women not only will the information further the well being of women clients but it could literally save lives interesting readable and well organized this book belongs on the shelf next to the dsm iv the case examples will grip the reader whether professional or lay audience
6087027 although smoking is the overwhelming cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd only 20 percent of smokers develop the disease
6087028 our findings suggest that mycoplasma pneumoniae mp infection may be one of the co factors that lead to copd and other diseases among smokers
6087029 without it all smokers would suffer significantly more lung damage
6087030 the mycoplasma infection completely blocked the protective response mice normally mount against tobacco smoke reducing antioxidant levels well below even those of mice breathing fresh air
6087031 the mycoplasma infection blocked the lungs protective response to tobacco smoke by lowering levels of the enzyme that normally recycles oxidized glutathione back into its protective reduced form
6087032 this resulted in severe oxidative stress and increased tissue damage as measured by oxidized dna newly detected air pollutant mimics damaging effects of cigarette smoke

6087305 our singer todd he had been doing burden brothers for a couple years and working that really hard
6087306 right at the end of a really long tour two of the guys in his band just up and quit the band he didnt know what else to do but just kind of keep writing music he didnt know what they would be for but as the songs came out they started sounding like toadies songs to him
6087307 so he called me he happened to catch me at a time when i was kind of a little burned out from the work i had been doing im an editor here in los angeles where i edit tv shows and documentaries i had been working really hard and kind of was looking at a reason to get out of editing for awhile he called and said do you want to do a new toadies album i was all for it especially after hearing a couple of the songs he had written they sound to me just like toadies songs too in a way that the burden brothers music didnt its interesting the way he can separate that stuff in his head
6087308 it kind of comes on the back of doing reunion shows last year when every show sold out faster than we thought it would and the crowd was off the hook more than i thought it would be
6087309 it just seems like people want to still hear the toadies there was no reason for us not to record a new album

6087320 the russian president hasnt kept his promise to abide by the terms of the ceasefire
6087321 what is clearly happening now is that russias reputation as a responsible actor in international politics a russia by the way that is a member of the security council is behaving in wholly irresponsible ways
6087322 but the longer this kind of behaviour goes on the more that russia demonstrates that its not willing to live up to the rules and the principles that really govern decent international behavior then russia is going to completely destroy its case for integration into those institutions and into that promise
6087323 the message is very clear and we will continue to consider what further consequences are appropriate as russia demonstrates this kind of behavior

6087329 i had a pretty good suspicion that people who were well motivated would do well with the technique but you have to be committed to learning it for it to benefit you i suspected most folks might not be that committed and so we might not show terribly much
6087330 this is a good large trial it is good enough evidence for people to take it seriously
6087331 but at the moment the alexander technique is not available on the nhs
6087332 in todays digital environment customers have become dependent on their internet connection relying on it more and more every day

6087345 when we recently underwent an extensive renovation we were looking for just this type of enhancement to better serve our traveling guests with the uncertainties surrounding air travel today providing guests with accurate airline information fills a much needed gap and adds confidence to their travel plans
6087346 installing flyte systems has really helped my staff before flyte they received a tremendous number of requests to go upstairs and print out boarding passes from the computers in the business center the lobby location is so much more convenient since guests can quickly duck out of meetings and glance at the flyteboard to see if their flight is on time and then print out boarding passes
6087347 we care about our guests and we were confident flyteboard was something that would help our business travelers once we roll out flytechannel our guests will not have to leave the comfort of their rooms until they have to
6087348 wiffiti definitely resonated with the crowd and pumped up the energy level for the 21 34 demographic the interactivity of text messaging is second nature which makes it a perfect complement to our digital jukeboxes at events like this

6087367 we used to have a name for right wing satire
6087368 at this point no one is taking responsibility for which law is holding him there
6087369 now i understand that theres a florida law on fugitives that allows them to give no bond and the florida judge said he wont give bond unless the prosecutor here in arizona says its ok which is not happening
6087370 he will sit in jail until he adjudicates the charges there in miami and then well pick him up
6087371 i went to the judge with a compromise solution where he could set aside the fugitive of justice warrant from last week and i asked for one week so we can get the ball rolling and get his arizona cases back on track
6087372 the judge said the bond was reasonable and if florida holds him they hold him i can tell you one thing ive never seen this process before on a marijuana case

6087374 one of the biggest benefits of atm or pin based cards for merchants is that they can cost up to 73 percent less than credit and signature debit cards

6087377 database archiving often fails to get the attention it needs compared to other critical activities related to production databases and data warehouses
6087378 an archival system becomes critical when you need to access archived information in response to a legal summons customer service issue security investigation or technical issue the value of archiving grows considerably as it becomes easier to access the archived data
6087379 with legal demands for access growing conventional approaches to database archiving are increasingly being found lacking they focus on lifting and shifting inactive data from production databases to improve application performance without considering how to optimize the way archived data is stored get your archiving right and you reduce storage costs and guarantee simple future proofed access get it wrong and at worst you could face prison
6087380 why database archiving should be part of your dbms strategy
6087381 it managers need to achieve a balance between the compliance demands for retention and the business demand for economical storage and retrieval current database management system technology is optimised for transactional processing data warehouses are optimised for analytics but both fail to adequately address archiving needs worse still the lines between archive stores and backup which have very different drivers and requirements are all too often blurred
6087382 forresters research clearly illustrates the need for the new generation of archive stores these deliver both massive reductions in storage footprints through data compression together with the security immutability and point in time query capability that enables quick simple and unimpeachable fulfilment of regulatory obligations

6087389 she goes onto say that she thought the rabbit had bitten her or done something to her thats why she had thrown it
6087390 the footage clearly shows her picking up the rabbit and throwing it against the wall
6087391 she accepts she had drunk three litres of lambrini and a couple of glasses of baileys
6087392 she accepts she should not have done it she deeply regrets it and is extremely remorseful for what she has done

6087543 phelps five month hiatus ends in february when he resumes serious training
6087544 i would rather it be three months but i wanted it to be five so that it was probably longer than he wants and when he comes back hes really ready to come back
6087545 hes on his own now he makes all the decisions outside the pool and i take care of the pool
6087546 in athens he had never had any personal freedom at all now hes had a lot and hes screwed it up and hes learned what that means
6087547 aussie olympic great ian thorpe has noticed a change in phelps too
6087548 it sounds really cliched but its true hes really grown as a human being
6087549 that in itself is going to serve him well as he makes these decisions in the upcoming few months and few years
6087550 i think hell just want to be a celebrity whatever that means hell just have to keep improving if he wants to do that he handles himself so much better than he did i was just amazed at some of the answers he gave to a lot of these questions this time
6087551 im happy to help him out if he wants a hand with some of these things
6087552 i think its just distant i dont think its good or bad theres not much there

6087559 im a little bit disappointed about some of the referee decisions made during the set there were three points in a row that he gave to russia the referee called me over and said that our coach would get a yellow card if he continued to talk to the second referee and after i turned around he gave the coach a yellow card
6087560 this gave russia the chance to wake up it was the most important moment of the match
6087561 the bulgarians despite the constant urging of middle blocker evgeni ivanov could not mount any kind of rally russia won it 20 25 25 16 25 22 25 21 on sergey tetyukhins successful block of konstantinovs spike

6087603 but as a power marketer enron could buy enough energy futures contracts in a region to create a virtual monopoly
6087604 should we have an economy thats based on whether people make good or bad bets or should we have an economy where people build companies create manufacturing do inventions advance the american society and make it more productive we are rewarding people for sitting at their computers and punching in bets thats not the way our economy is going to be built and india and china with their focus on science and industry and building real businesses are going to eat our lunch unless the american public wakes up and puts an end to an economy that praises and makes heroes out of speculators

6087620 this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to have everyone who works in politics in one place
6087621 itll be a rare opportunity to have such hands on work between googlers and users
6087622 in terms of general interest around the election were only seeing it grow
6087623 the online component will hopefully make the convention a bit more personal and a bit more on demand
6087624 politics has been the top news category on yahoo news for six straight months so theres no question were seeing a strong interest in it
6087625 yahoo is in a much different position to provide deeper coverage of the convention than we were four years ago
6087626 these are partnerships we didnt have and we werent getting the video coverage like this four years ago
6087627 we do consider our technical support and expertise were providing to the conventions our first priority in helping them put on a first rate convention
6087628 three years ago adriana recognized the surging mineral super cycle and through strategic partnerships with athena and worldlink quickly identified the need for a new iron ore port facility in brazil that would create an export opportunity to deliver iron ore to the end user
6087629 today we have partnered with the leading steel corporation in the world to export iron ore from brazil partnering with arcelormittal is a significant milestone in the advancement of our brazilian iron ore strategy
6087630 arcelormittal brings the global expertise in mining ports seaborne shipping logistics and the ability to finance large infrastructure and mining projects through to operation
6087631 the planned port facility at sepetiba bay in brazil is the ideal captive solution to deliver access to the export market for ore from the iron quadrangle region
6087632 they dont have insight on how bad losses are going to get
6087633 we believe that our solid financial results were driven mainly by our fashions for the family and the home
6087634 it is prudent to remain defensively positioned based on the uncertain macro economic and retail environments which no longer have the benefit of the tax rebate checks
6087635 monitoring data shows that indianas air quality continues to improve
6087636 will not include as many counties as todays preliminary designations
6087637 we will be submitting additional analyses to usepa to support our position
6087638 we are hopeful that usepa will carefully examine this information and respond accordingly
6087639 this is evident from a large number of factors including its lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity
6087640 this has resulted in investment that is not tailored to the requirements of airport users and lower levels and quality of service for both airlines and passengers
6087641 monopolies clearly dont work and the baa monopoly has done huge damage to competition and the traveling public and it is high time it was broken up
6087642 this is not the end of the competition commission process
6087643 we will continue to point out to the commission the many areas where we believe its analysis is flawed and its remedies would be disproportionate and counterproductive

6087649 i donated to the obama campaign because i was so excited and thrilled to hear him speak
6087650 i like what he says and i like what he represents and its a world stage today for any political leader
6087651 it was an error of me to give the donation and it was an error that it was accepted
6087652 consistently review our procedures to make sure that we are taking every reasonable step to ensure that the contributions we receive are appropriate and follow fec guidelines and we will do so again in light of this new information
6087653 were always looking for ways to best comply with all provisions of campaign finance regulations and obviously take swift action anytime flags are raised regarding potentially problematic campaign contributions
6087654 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6087655 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6087656 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6087657 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6087658 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board
6087659 ive never been as interested in a presidential election in the united states
6087660 the state machinery in the united states functions with or without a president
6087661 if i said that was a great softball game it would be an understatement
6087662 i knew she wasnt going to throw anything that was going to try to dance by me
6087663 she was coming at me hard she was going to try to beat me with her speed
6087664 this is to honour and respect the memory of our president whose support for football was demonstrated through his personal love for the sport and through his governments continued support to the game
6087665 its a little bit more of a grinding kind of an offense right now we may take more chances in regard to hit and runs and things like that because it might be more necessary to start runners to get things done
6087666 a decision has to be made somewhere in the year to focus on good at bats and seeing the ball
6087667 you dont want to do stuff dont complicate it simplify
6087668 when youre forced to play people on a daily basis that arent used to it at some point you might see diminishing returns
6087669 we havent dealt with yet but well probably have to deal with that now
6087670 weve been so focused on just being at the olympics
6087671 with the youth on this team the next one would have been the big one
6087672 do you know i have always had a little soft spot for him if i am totally honest
6087673 but i do tell him when i think he is wrong because he is not always right
6087674 just being around simon and his ego hes taught me quite a lot
6087675 the fact that he respects my opinion has given me confidence and made me feel better too
6087676 she has natural instincts as to whether people are good or not and has her own opinions she is one of the best people i have ever worked with
6087677 sometimes we as hitters as players put a little too much pressure on ourselves
6087678 youve still got to see the ball and hit the ball its not like hes going to make up a pitch with the bases loaded
6087679 we just have to pick up the slack and do the best we can at this point i dont even know what else the organization can do
6087680 its nice to be on the other end of one of those games someone elses bullpen gave it up and ours didnt its amazing how that works sometimes
6087681 its the toughest situation a bullpen can be put in and every reliever should crave it i know i do
6087682 i made a very below average pitch to an above average hitter and i paid for it it doesnt matter how many times you get a guy out the one time you dont stinks
6087683 i think i just got the jitters its a different atmosphere once i settled down i did good
6087684 this is a huge change from just five years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side air bags and electronic stability control were rare
6087685 no single crash test provides a full picture of a vehicles crashworthiness
6087686 far more teens die in alcohol related incidents than in those caused by all the other illicit drugs combined
6087687 jazz is probably my main influence but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician
6087688 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
6087689 all of us are just really sad and down about it
6087690 but if dave and the band decided to go on with the show that means they know it was the right thing to do and leroi would have wanted it
6087691 all parties capable of helping put out forest fires in to work together to extinguish them
6087692 observers on the ground have indicated to wwf that 250 to 280 hectares of forest on both sides of the kura river have been burned or are alight
6087693 direct permit receive require or facilitate the use of tax revenues or any other public resources for campaign lobbying or partisan purposes
6087694 the right to privacy of our contributors is considered sacrosanct
6087695 today the days of being cut off from the rest of the world while in the air become history
6087696 power is a large factor in total cost of ownership depending on where you are in the world it may be 10 to 30 percent of your datacenter bill
6087697 this will allow it users to significantly optimize their power load into their datacenters of the future so it customers will look at this as a very attractive feature
6087698 there is a major discrepancy in the two urine samples of asif which came out positive and in such cases the player has a chance to be cleared
6087699 we will appeal to the ipl drug tribunal and point out the difference in the test results
6087700 i still remember that an indian gold medalist athlete sunita rani had a similar case of varied readings at the busan asian games in 2002 and she won her case at the cas
6087701 gutman is coming in on the 22nd hes working his schedule around to make sure he can get here lives in atlanta you know but excited about coming up here to talk with you
6087702 gutman wants us to pay for his airfare up here and to put him up for a night since he wont be able to make the round trip in one day
6087703 gutman says that since his interview is on a friday and he has other appointments in new york it will be difficult for him to get back to atlanta before sunday night
6087704 and he wants us to pay for his wife to accompany him on the trip

6087707 los estadios no han sido optimizados el c sped contin a con la apariencia de moqueta verde sin relieve y en general es inevitable quedarse con la sensaci n de que se tiene delante el mismo juego de la temporada pasada con una capa de maquill

6087713 civilizations flourish the most where the masses are passionate about their liberties
6087714 we feel the new regulations could have a disastrous impact on many of our towns in somerset county
6087715 to support them we are contributing 10 000 to the legal battle they are waging
6087716 although we are not participating in the lawsuit because technically the coah rules do not affect county government we feel its important to support our towns and we will be closely monitoring the progress of this lawsuit
6087717 when it comes to the unlocked version we have seen some significant interest from large enterprise customers
6087718 3g performance on the phone running 2 0 2 was by far improved and though it may not be running at lightning speed its certainly a big improvement especially when compared to the performance of the phone running 2 0 1
6087719 yeah women are like that and it will probably get worse until high school it should let up a bit then if youre lucky and choose to run with women that dont suck like that you can also eventually use dude revenge by paying attention to a girl for a while and then go run off and play with your male friends and totally ignore her thereby gaining revenge in your head on the whole of the female species this initially will be a genetic flaw but by college will most likely be a measured response which you will hopefully outgrow by the time you graduate college
6087720 each august a company of actors designers and musicians spend one week in the homes around our community exploring a play by anton chekhov
6087721 im sure everyone is wondering whats going on so im gonna let you all in on some news ok so we will hopefully be announcing our new singer soon i cant give you a name or hints yet but we have not been this happy in a long time he is a sick ass singer as well as a person we are going into audiohammer studios in september to record some new shit and as soon as we have it so will you

6087724 im already half switching into that mindset of preparing you for me leaving and making sure you have the same knowledge i have when it comes to how things work around the house
6087725 while there are differences across the segments some interesting overall conclusions can be drawn about guys today
6087726 for one thing this research with spike shows that guys are still deciphering what it means to be a man in the post feminist world
6087727 and just like women guys have more options for identity than ever before in the past a guys life path was clear but today there is no set model or path and mens identities have become fragmented more than ever guys are creating their own milestones and measures for success
6087728 i dont know if i am ready to leave china

6087737 last week i am wondering what kind of relationship he is looking for on that site is he single now just curious
6087738 sometimes i get sad because sometimes im out of town a lot brian works but hes always in town and i have to travel a lot and sometimes thats hard because itll be weeks and weeks without seeing cash kassius and thats sad luckily hes used to it because both of his parents are in the business so hes used to always being in transit and its not so hard on him but i feel guilty a lot
6087739 i was raised in the south and my mom was a strict disciplinarian its really easy for me to lay out the rules and make sure that the rules are followed constantly but i think because hes from a home with divorced parents its hard for brian to punish him kassius he feels bad that cash has to always go through the transition in switching homes
6087740 the mccain campaign believes that some of hillary clintons tactics especially questioning whether obama is ready to lead can be a real winner
6087741 the mccain team has been very open that they went to school on the hillary clinton campaign that they learned from that
6087742 and on this 3 a m ad whats very striking as some have pointed out over the last few days is that barack obama was winning a steady streak of victories against hillary clinton
6087743 and then she ran that ad and she really went on the attack on the experience question and she won the bulk of the primaries thereafter in the closing months of the democratic primaries and won 500 000 more votes than he did and almost took it away from him
6087744 which candidate do voters believe is better qualified to deal with russia mccain by better than 2 1
6087745 going after more centrist voters more swing voters more conservative voters who will be a much bigger deal in the general election than they were in those primaries and caucuses
6087746 not only did the clinton campaign give mccain and his advisers a road map but they actually started the mccains down that path
6087747 thats why youre hearing from obama very specific policy oriented proposals here
6087748 theres not a lot of that kind of flash if you will from the earlier days
6087749 the big question now is whether obama can successfully regain control of the campaign agenda as we head into the democratic convention
6087750 what the clinton campaign demonstrated is when you bring obama back down to earth its a better battle
6087751 we are fine we did have a little quarrel but we just needed to talk
6087752 too much time away from someone you feel for mas mahirap in a way shes gonna start a movie soon im doing this indie film so i wont see her often

6087760 the outraged women of mount isa felt that the mayors comments were archaic and it is totally not the image that we want to project for our city
6087761 i wont be resigning because im quite comfortable with what i said
6087762 mount isa my city has taken the olympic games off the front page of papers all over australia and the world and ive never heard of that happening before people have supported me everywhere and at the moment i feel like im sitting on the top of mount kosciusko
6087763 the country has produced some of the worlds most prominent feminists germaine greer carmen callil lynne segal
6087764 in fact if theres one aspect of the mount isa story that really stands out for me its the womens response as we went to press they were organising a protest rally on the lawns of the civic centre now thats the spirit
6087765 so i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to afghanistan and got educated about afghanistan and iraq
6087766 most voters say they know people who feel that way
6087767 after 9 11 i was happy that bush stood up and let the terrorists know that he wasnt going to let it happen again
6087768 that would be an issue his administration would have to face early because hes pledging to be a uniter not a divider without saying those exact words we campaigned on in 2000 hes pledging to change the way washington works and if congress were to pursue that it would be very divisive
6087769 which tv star has developed an unhealthy crush on his assistant he bombards her with inappropriate calls day and night and even tells her about er special dreams he is having

6087782 john mccains platform and it certainly looks inviting for the fall
6087783 mccain takes hands off approach in drafting of gop platform
6087784 the republican standard bearer is at odds with his party on such hot button issues as global warming immigration campaign finance overhaul stem cell research drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge and a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage
6087785 there are some who would push the republican national committee toward a weak platform that appeases the liberals we believe that is flat out wrong
6087786 the republican standard bearer is at odds with his party on such hot button issues as global warming immigration campaign finance overhaul stem cell research drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge and a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage

6087798 we should hire three or four colored ministers preferably with social service backgrounds and with engaging personalities the most successful educational approach to the is through a religious appeal we dont want the word to go out that we want to exterminate the population and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members
6087799 i have to make myself look vulnerable to those people right now

6087996 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6087997 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6087998 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6087999 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6088000 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6088001 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6088002 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6088003 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6088004 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6088005 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6088006 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6088007 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6088008 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6088009 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6088010 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6088011 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6088012 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6088013 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6088014 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6088015 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6088016 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6088017 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6088018 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6088019 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6088020 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6088021 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6088022 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6088023 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6088024 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6088025 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6088026 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6088027 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6088028 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6088029 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6088030 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6088031 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6088032 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6088033 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6088034 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6088035 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6088036 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6088037 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6088038 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6088039 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6088040 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6088041 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6088042 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6088043 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6088044 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6088045 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6088046 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did

6088050 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6088051 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6088052 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6088053 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6088054 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6088055 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6088056 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6088057 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6088058 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6088059 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6088060 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6088061 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas

6088148 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6088149 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6088150 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6088151 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6088152 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6088153 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6088154 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6088155 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6088156 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6088157 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6088158 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6088159 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6088160 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6088161 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6088162 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6088163 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6088164 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6088165 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6088166 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6088167 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6088168 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6088169 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6088170 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6088171 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6088172 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6088173 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6088174 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6088175 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6088176 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6088177 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6088178 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6088179 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6088180 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

6088183 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6088184 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6088185 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6088186 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6088187 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6088188 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6088189 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6088190 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6088191 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6088192 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6088193 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6088194 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6088195 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6088196 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6088197 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6088198 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6088199 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6088200 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6088201 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6088202 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6088203 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6088204 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that

6088206 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6088207 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba

6088209 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6088210 this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone
6088211 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defence site that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of a long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6088212 both sides have achieved their goals this is a great success for poland
6088213 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6088214 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6088215 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6088216 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6088217 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6088218 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6088219 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6088220 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6088221 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6088222 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

6088246 when i went to the book release party i wore a shirt that says bella sucks
6088247 i think bella is a bit underdeveloped as a character
6088248 hermione was first and foremost a person and shes realistic its a pity bella doesnt have a secret inner strength shes more of just a pure maiden
6088249 bella always needs saving what does she do for fun she cooks dinners for her dad she doesnt have friends outside of edward and her family im kind of sad that so many girls are latching on to her as a role model when her whole focus is getting married and having sex with a vampire

6088252 there is now an alarming gulf between what the government is doing and what is necessary to change the underlying economic performance
6088253 the governments spending packages are no more than papering over cracks in a mindless exercise and are not based on delivering genuine value for money and cutting out serious waste
6088254 tens of thousands of building workers and their families are paying a high price for this governments gross mishandling of the construction sector
6088255 the government ignored all the warning signs that the economy was heading for a slowdown and failed to prepare for the recession even though all the economic indicators pointed to such an inevitability

6088265 its simpler and safer to have a flat out rule its like drug regulation drugs are banned sometimes because a minority of users will have negative side effects or because taking them correctly is complicated although many people could get it right and would find them helpful actually im opposed to that kind of thinking re drugs but i am ok with it regarding punctuation punctuation cant save your life

6088278 there were only six of us to begin with just having a drink and listening to music
6088279 then a couple of other friends turned up that i hadnt seen for ages we heard some shouting in the street and went out to see what was going on
6088280 then more people let themselves in uninvited and it all went downhill from there
6088281 there was flour all over the floor and blood everywhere people were cutting their feet on broken glass i was really upset
6088282 i went round to apologise to all my neighbours the next day
6088283 it was awful there were about 30 teenagers drunk and running riot in the street one window was smashed
6088284 they appeared to be drunk and were screaming they kept us up all night from 11pm
6088285 people felt frightened in their own homes and one elderly woman told me she was too scared to even turn the light on to call the police it is totally unacceptable
6088286 one girl was even running around wielding a large stick it was utterly terrifying one of the residents on the street described it as being like beirut
6088287 about 20 lads were going up and down the street shouting and screaming until about four in the morning
6088288 it was just horrendous we didnt get much sleep that night they broke a window and scratched two cars we dont expect that kind of behaviour round here
6088289 holly invited some friends around and all of a sudden weve got world war three
6088290 our neighbours phoned us when we were away and they told us the whole neighbourhood had been talking about it
6088291 they told us their had been fighting in the street smashed glass everywhere and some of our elderly neighbours were terrified
6088292 we had a right go at holly over the phone because we had been told that the house had been smashed up i was heartbroken
6088293 weve been told it was like kosovo it got completely out of hand something happened out on the street and somehow holly got involved
6088294 its just really embarrassing its out of character for holly because she is a good kid and has been bought up the right way
6088295 but we have to hold our hands up and apologise because if there was no party to begin with none of this would have happened
6088296 police received three calls from residents that evening reporting disturbances and reports of youths fighting
6088297 this is concerning and we are looking to increase police patrols of that area to reassure the public

6088801 trasmedia as per agreement was responsible for the procurement of a licence for globecast and there was no reason for charging the company
6088802 transmedia is the one that had been authorised to bring globecast into zimbabwe and there is no reason why globecast should be charged
6088803 they entered into a contract which is clear and no evidence has been adduced to prove that globecast intentionally committed the said offence
6088804 the essential elements of the offence have not been proved and therefore the accused is found not guilty and acquitted at the close of the states case

6088833 history teaches the danger of government that overreaches political control taking presidence over free economic growth secret police mindless beaurocrisy all combined to stifle individual excellence and personal freedom and one of the simple and overwhelming facts of our time is this of all the millions of refugees weve seen in the modern world their flight is always away from not toward the communist world rejection of the arbitrary power of the state the refusal to subordinate the rights of the individual to the superstate the realization that collectivism stifles all the best human impulses for the sake of peace and justice let us move toward a world in which all people are at last free to determine their own destiny

6088847 i heard a sound like the bursting of a cracker after which i saw a small revolver in the left hand of one of the boys the revolver seemed to be a desi one the boys should not be more than 30 years old

6088858 his political leadership and dedication to the democratisation of the southern african development community region will serve as an inspiration to those striving for democratic change in both zimbabwe and swaziland and elsewhere in the continent
6088859 if this ceasefire clause on pre 7 august positions is not applied quickly and in its entirety i will convoke an extraordinary council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
6088860 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
6088861 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
6088862 we will have to determine if the russian intervention against its georgian neighbour was a brutal and excessive response
6088863 in which case there will be inevitable consequences for its relations with the european union
6088864 i do not advise any knee jerk reaction such as suspending talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement with the eu
6088865 our interest in this is as great as russia itself talks in the nato russian council are essential too because we need open lines of communication
6088866 we must stick to the partnership with russia even after these recent events which of course do not please us
6088867 if there is a relevant decision of the president of russia
6088868 the presidency reaffirms its support to algerian authorities in its fight against terrorism and stands alongside algeria in these tragic circumstances
6088869 if there is a relevant decision of the president of russia
6088870 the presidency reaffirms its support to algerian authorities in its fight against terrorism and stands alongside algeria in these tragic circumstances
6088871 the technical agreement gives unmik the united nations mission in kosovo the green light for transferring assets to us
6088872 as with every similar provocation this technical move cannot be ignored and the government will submit a protest to the un security council you cant go about it the eulex transfer this way
6088873 brussels plans to have eulex enter kosovo through that process we are aware of this and it is illegal
6088874 russia will give serbia the most energetic support in this
6088875 if there is a relevant decision of the president of russia
6088876 the presidency reaffirms its support to algerian authorities in its fight against terrorism and stands alongside algeria in these tragic circumstances
6088877 the eu should evaluate whether it is possible to continue in an unaltered way the post pca talks negotiations on a new eu russia treaty visa dialogue or other cooperation activities
6088878 we have seen some disagreements between eu member states on many occasions including the georgia issue still it does not create a deep rift
6088879 nato refusing to grant a map membership action plan for georgia and ukraine at the bucharest summit made a principle mistake we can say that it partly led to the situation that we have in georgia today
6088880 by giving a map to georgia and to ukraine we would clearly show to russia how unhelpful it is to even try flexing its muscles
6088881 the eu visa facilitation issue for georgia will have to be raised further as well as a preparation of a comprehensive free trade agreement
6088882 if there is a relevant decision of the president of russia

6088894 on the whole all of these threats that have been raining down on russia turned out to be empty words
6088895 i think we should still engage with the russians but in a hard headed way and we mustnt allow the russians to feel they are the victims of this affair when they are the transgressors

6088902 at a given moment we will be faced with ultimatums

6088925 if this ceasefire clause on pre 7 august positions is not applied quickly and in its entirety i will convoke an extraordinary council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
6088926 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
6088927 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
6088928 we will have to determine if the russian intervention against its georgian neighbour was a brutal and excessive response
6088929 in which case there will be inevitable consequences for its relations with the european union
6088930 i do not advise any knee jerk reaction such as suspending talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement with the eu
6088931 our interest in this is as great as russia itself talks in the nato russian council are essential too because we need open lines of communication

6088944 geothermal energy which is sometimes known as hot rocks has got a huge potential for australia both as a solution to climate change and in terms of national energy security
6088945 one percent of reserves would produce 26 000 years of energy supplies
6088946 the upper cost boundary will decline over time because the level of uncertainty is expected to narrow as the industry grows this cost is expected to be lowest cost of any form of renewable or low emissions energy
6088947 we could now see australias first commercially viable geothermal power plants in place within four to five years
6088948 geothermal energy provides clean base load power and is potentially a very important contributor to australias energy mix in a carbon constrained world

6088970 i dont think theres anything productive about demonizing marketers my point of view is that consumers cant blame anyone but themselves for their purchase decisions and the consequences of those decisions both on a personal level and a societal level marketers didnt dictate massive demand for four wheel drive suvs for driving around city streets consumers demanded that of course marketers did their best to exploit that demand to the fullest but theres just nothing productive in my view about scapegoating anybody

6088981 i dont think theres any doubt the major major issue is water and can be as important as oil so the compact that is in effect obviously needs to be renegotiated over time amongst the interested parties
6088982 i think that theres a movement amongst the governors to try if not quote renegotiate certainly adjust to the new realities of high growth of greater demands on a scarcer resource
6088983 conditions have changed dramatically so im not saying that anyone would be forced to do anything because im a federalist and believe in the rights of states
6088984 but at the same time theres already been discussion amongst the states and i believe that more discussion amongst the governors is probably something that everybody wants us to do

6089004 how the company booked free software trials as revenues and how its executives set up shell corporations for allegedly self dealing purposes
6089005 through publicly available information we were aware of the review of fasts historical accounting practices and their efforts to implement improved financial controls since completing our tender offer we have taken several steps to align these efforts to microsofts high standards for financial reporting and controls we remain absolutely confident in our decision to acquire fast for its talent technology and valued customer relationships
6089006 fast has always been renowned for its speed and scalability so in many ways from a technology perspective it was a good choice for microsoft
6089007 poor financial practices on the part of senior management dont necessarily reflect poorly on the technology but it should be enough to make a buyer look elsewhere for something comparable from a financially healthier or at least more honest company
6089008 on the other hand though the sequence of first having dubious sales practices then correcting the books and firing staff in 2007 then selling to microsoft has triggered the departure of many of fasts best engineers also fast has been suffering severely from expansion anxiety its sales staff would promise anything leaving engineers to deliver since fast was selling quite a lot or at least doing a lot of trial runs their tech resources were spread out too thin and often they couldnt make good on the original promises

6089030 the typical what i call operating budget in a home has dwindled
6089031 its going toward living expenses gas food there arent the discretionary funds that you would put toward education so they have to rely more heavily on federal and state aid
6089032 when you have limited resources in those federal funds that means you have to spread the money out so you may not be able to award as much to as many people
6089033 even people who normally pay out of pocket realized its best to apply for aid and see what they can get
6089034 weve got one here and another one coming in two years

6089054 for me when i watch other sports when i watch tiger woods when i watch roger federer when i watch rafael nadal the best athletes can compete under any circumstances no matter what it is no matter what the pressure you can always overcome whatever is put in your way
6089055 i dont think about it like that i think of it as something i love to do and i am having fun with it
6089056 doing normal high school kid things was something i was willing to give up i know i wont have opportunities like this in the sport for the rest of my life
6089057 an absolute lack of faith in their ability to implement the security measures they have proposed

6089060 there are external threats and there are internal threats we could point to a benazir bhutto situation to see whether the team could be secured

6089062 god sent her to play basketball he woke up one day and said basketball needs lauren jackson
6089063 hes the best coach i ever had tom maher is an amazing coach he is my favourite coach of all time i have so much respect for him as a coach and as a person
6089064 hes already proved how good a coach he is by bringing china as far as he has
6089065 she had every coach drooling they just couldnt believe it it was freakish shes got the whole package
6089066 every generation we see a great player a truly world class basketball player come along it was robyn maher and michele timms and before that it was say jenny cheesman and people like that but i dont see lauren in the same category as that because i think shes a once in a lifetime player
6089067 shes the sort of player that you dont see once every generation i think that if you use the dawn fraser analogy name a favourite female swimmer you talk about shane gould or tracey wickham or swimmers that were wonderful champions at their time but you would not compare them with dawn fraser and i think thats the sort of thing that laurens going to be shes not just the once in a generation shes the once in a lifetime
6089068 you cant stop her except maybe with a baseball bat you just hope she misses a couple of shots
6089069 shes the greatest catch ive ever seen in any sport she turns bad passes into assists she is just so hard to stop
6089070 one of those one in 10 000 players who can do it all
6089071 nothing surprises me anymore when it comes to lauren and the scary thing is there is no telling what this young lady can do in the future
6089072 it isnt so much a matter of doing something dangerous as being master of that danger
6089073 bridgestones participation in 200 formula one races shows the level of commitment we have given to the sport and we are delighted to be working with all of the teams and so many major motor manufacturers in our current position as official tyre supplier participating in a major sport brings us many benefits and in return we hope we have helped the sport grow just as we have grown through being part of formula one
6089074 bridgestone is very happy to be celebrating its 200th grand prix since 1997 entering formula one was a big step for us twelve seasons ago but one which was very valuable as our brand awareness has increased significantly since then formula one is one of the biggest sports in the world so we are very proud of our role as official tyre supplier for this and the next two seasons

6089098 whether youre a gut instinct believer or skeptic samsung electronics canada has given a new meaning to calling on your instinct
6089099 while our instinct device is not intended to replace a persons instincts it does have several features that may help if your own instincts let you down
6089100 i am very pleased that a member of irelands rapid response corps will contribute to the relief effort i spoke to anthony this morning to wish him well in his important assignment
6089101 it is particularly important at this time that access for humanitarian workers and supplies is facilitated to all conflict affected areas without delay
6089102 there is nothing more soul satisfying than the first succulent bite into the juicy frankfurter
6089103 as for me far be it from me that i should sin against the lord by ceasing to pray for you but i will instruct you in the good and right way only fear the lord and serve him in truth with all your heart for consider what great things he has done for you
6089104 la crisis que vive el periodismo deportivo no es s lo resultado de los compromisos e intereses econ micos que los medios de difusi n puedan adquirir y que subordinan el trabajo de los periodistas hay tambi n una enorme crisis de creatividad reforzada por el hecho de que muchos de quienes lo practican dan la impresi n de no haber pisado nunca una cancha de juego y quienes s la han pisado hay exdeportistas trabajando como periodistas dan muestras de que no cuentan con la formaci n profesional necesaria para dedicarse a la actividad period stica
6089105 es una posibilidad para que el equipo de pumas tenga m s posibilidad
6089106 en realidad lo que vemos ahora no es periodismo deportivo sino un perfil que se enfoca y se limita m s a animar lo que ya de por s se est vien do o escuchando
6089107 en el pasado el que hablaba era un periodista formado e informado que hac a ver o entender hasta cierto punto lo que uno escuchaba por la radio o lo que no percib a en las im genes televisivas con el paso del tiempo lo que hemos advertido es que se ha afianzado el deporte como industria sobre todo lo que es la industria televisiva
6089108 y es que como el objeto de estos programas no es hacer periodismo sino mercadotecnia de la industria deportiva no les importan ya los conteni dos o sea apelan al rating no al respeto al p blico eso es sumamente lamentable
6089109 lo que realmente est n mostrando es su falta de imaginaci n su falta de ideas su miseria de contenidos
6089110 ellos creen que a la gente le divierte eso pero se est n alejando mucho del esp ritu de lo que est n mostrando que es la competencia la virtud la energ a de los deportistas la disciplina la constancia e incluso los niveles en los que estamos en distintas disciplinas en fin est n distray ndose de su principal labor cubrir una justa deportiva
6089111 el periodismo deportivo ha ca do en la corrupci n en la incompetencia y en desinter s por el deporte actualmente cualquiera accede a los medios de comunicaci n ya que lo nico que se necesita es gritar
6089112 ante la proliferaci n de la radio la televisi n y la prensa se incurri en la contrataci n de personal sin apropiada capacitaci n
6089113 los programas deportivos han ca do en la superficialidad transmiten resultados comentan las haza as de los deportistas vedettes y la mayor a de las veces no emiten juicios cr ticos
6089114 el colmo de los colmos se lamenta omar ra l mart nez es que ahora hasta las actrices son conductoras o acompa antes de la cobertura deportiva no es que uno desde e o falte al respeto a las profesionales de la actuaci n pero hay una cantidad de egresados aspirantes a ser buenos periodistas gente que realmente tiene la capacidad para hacer un periodismo a la altura de otros pa ses a los que no se toma en cuenta
6089115 al deporte lo han transformado en un espect culo sobre todo en juegos ol mpicos eso de entrada es ya estar equivocado y se hace a n peor cuando como ha sucedido en m xico en los ltimos 12 a os esta equivocaci n se mezcla todav a con humorismo y comicidad corrientes
6089116 s lo basta mirar al compayito dizque haciendo una entrevista eso es periodismo o ese supuesto reportero de primero beijing que va a china y pregunta cu nto cuesta el kilo de sand a para comparar el precio con el de m xico y eso es todo lo que hace perd n pero eso no es periodismo si bien sabemos que el contenido que se dice period stico en la televisi n no informa sino s lo entretiene esto ya raya en la superficialidad de la c scara
6089117 que yo recuerde pocas veces se ven este tipo de notas ir al mercado a ver cu nto cuesta el kilo de naranja en su propia realidad la informaci n s lo queda en mera an cdota lo peor del caso es que la presentan de una manera pobre con gente que apenas alcanza a expresarse con un micr fono y que no tiene formaci n claro con sus excepciones que siempre las hay en los programas deportivos no se ven las costumbres y tradiciones chinas es decir los testimonios de una cultura milenaria sino la pr ctica oriental bajo la ptica de la tele que es la simplicidad y la dizque comicidad
6089118 cuando estuve en rtc revis bamos los contenidos y hac amos algunos se alamientos a los productores en relaci n con los horarios de transmisi n ahora ya es una pachanga el contenido puede ser de lo m s vulgar por la ma ana la tarde en horarios familiares no hay ning n pudor ni ning n cuidado por usar el doble sentido no hay ning n respeto por el p blico uno se pregunta c mo van a invitar a un ni o a practicar un deporte si est n chacoteando todo el tiempo con albures y doble sentido si no hay ninguna reflexi n sobre la importancia del deporte
6089119 casi todos los programas son una verg enza de la que acaso se salva el canal de cable tvc deportes
6089120 por qu los est pidos van ganando cada d a m s un espacio dentro de la cultura masiva de la televisi n qu la supina palurda insensata disposici n del televidente s lo conduce a un enriquecimiento en este caso absolutamente irracional injusto inicuo e incluso inmoral adem s il cito de empresarios que no tienen criterio de est tica mucho menos de tica comunicacional
6089121 a diferencia de la prensa escrita incluso de la radio donde es much sima m s amplia la gama la tele por cable es muy cara as que la poblaci n en general no tiene acceso a ella por lo tanto s lo dispone de dos sopas una muy aterrizada al mercado popular basta con ver la calidad de su producto malo en general que es tv azteca y otra que presenta cosas a veces buenas pero que no posee identidad propia que es televisa la cual aun siendo la poderosa empresa que es se la pasa importando ideas y programas cada seis meses

6089139 when you show pictures of tucker on your blog i always call tyler over to see them he just loves dogs
6089140 tucker lives on the second story back porch and he can go down the stairs to the courtyard my tenant ava has a half grown beagle basset hound named biscuit and its great fun watching tucker and biscuit tussle and play
6089141 its very seldom were hoping for a hurricane but we are
6089142 there is as strong a commitment to our university system as ever
6089143 im hopeful that good times are just around the corner but we have to budget and prepare in case theyre not
6089144 additionally when people feel that theyre overworked and underpaid the incidences of malfeasance go up
6089145 perhaps companies will want to put windfarms atop our bridges and skyscrapers or use the enormous potential of powerful off shore winds miles out in the atlantic ocean where turbines could generate roughly twice the energy that land based windfarms can
6089146 we want their best ideas for creating both small and large scale projects serving new yorkers
6089147 if rooftop wind can make it anywhere this is a great city
6089148 you contain your infrastructure but you also contain the heat thats generated from the servers
6089149 we are working incredibly hard to improve the energy efficiency of our data centers
6089150 we are not physically building our servers but there is very deep engagement with the computer makers
6089151 search was a very large portion of our demand in fiscal year 2008
6089152 going into this year it is still a very large proportion it is now not as dominant as it was last year
6089153 one of the big drivers for us that i see is the move to ip based delivery of rich video
6089154 we just adopted a kitten and our other cat has stopped using the litterbox so we have to get rid of her

6089157 he said it was his job even after he got his orders that he was going over there he said its his job
6089158 he loved me i loved him and id give anything to have him back
6089159 despite an increasingly difficult enterprise spending environment in the u s and parts of europe reasonable growth expectations strength in emerging countries currency and product cycles should be enough to drive some upside for each company
6089160 theyre very high growth economies but theyre still subject to volatility
6089161 i think chinas just kind of a who knows its so hot it has to come down eventually
6089162 even if china goes from 25 percent to 15 percent year over year growth it can cause some volatility
6089163 youre going to hear notebooks doing well for both companies
6089164 i think that hp continues to be very upbeat about what it can do with eds and will go to great lengths on the conference call to convince people of that
6089165 share gains on the inkjet side combined with stronger emerging market growth on the laser side should drive another quarter of mid single digit revenue growth in printers and operating margin above 15 percent
6089166 even against a tough comparison we expect hp to maintain double digit pc revenue growth on strength outside of the u s
6089167 if it does continue to strengthen you could see some of that be a headwind to top line growth
6089168 its a good thing they havent gotten rid of those nuclear submarines at faslane
6089169 what does it take to go from good designer to great designer

6089171 we dont know why theyre on the list they dont know why theyre on the list the government wont tell us why theyre on the list
6089172 the shocking rise in energy prices is the direct result of big oil and their cronies like scott garrett blocking sound energy policy for years and the pain we are all enduring is no laughing matter
6089173 but i believe that humor helps to highlight the absurdity of garrett talking about lowering gas prices while he is in the pocket of big oil opposing alternative energy at every turn while voting to protect big oils enormous tax breaks and windfall profits
6089174 69 000 in contributions helped big oil guarantee that garrett would vote to give the oil amp gas industry billions in tax breaks and oppose helping move the toward renewable clean energy which could lead to lower gas prices
6089175 it is time for a member of congress who is a community leader rather than a career politician someone who will stand up to big oil and washingtons corrupt special interest culture

6089191 the 360 was always going to see an upsurge in sales with the release of vesperia it happened last year as well when blue dragon and lost odyssey hit stores over there

6089196 verveling is een onaangenaam gevoel van lusteloosheid van desinteresse van hangerigheid grenzend aan ergernis verveling treedt op als alle dingen die leuk en interessant zijn om te doen niet kunnen of niet mogen en men toch geen zin heeft om niets te doen verveling kan het gevolg zijn van een gebrek aan prikkels of van prikkels die als saai eentonig of repetitief ervaren worden
6089197 rousseau noemde de verveling een elitaire ziekte dostojewski zag de verveling als een uitvinding van de aristocratie en schopenhauer schreef dat de verveling de gesel van de rijken is je zou kunnen zeggen dat wie welvaart vermeerdert vermeerdert verveling de verveelde mens lijdt niet ondanks het geluk maar dankzij het geluk
6089198 we zijn voortdurend op zoek naar het interessante en denken dat de verveling dan wel verdwijnt maar er heerst geen inter esse dat wil zeggen we zijn niet meer werkelijk te midden van de zijnden dat heeft er mee te maken dat we ons niet meer kunnen concentreren en geen geduld meer kunnen opbrengen voor de dingen
6089199 we moeten geduld opbrengen voor de dingen wanneer we vertraagd van de ene naar de ander plek gaan kunnen we nog verrast worden door de dingen die we zien

6089230 i believe you can attract whatever you want as long as the vision is honest and true to you then it is possible
6089231 but we all want to be loved even if it isnt that likely to find the
6089232 i wish you never ending love i have heard it is out there lucky fucks
6089233 im afraid in the past few years i have become cynical about love and any kind of fairy tale happy ending
6089234 i feel the fairy tale ended when jobs began going overseas and or out of state money woes can ruin a relationship and or marriage when americans could no longer depend on that 30 year gold watch and retirement job things changed
6089235 they lose sight of reality the reality is men do not think like women
6089236 i have no aspirations to be a political consultant in any sense of the word
6089237 i loved the fact that americans saw not just the political differences between these two guys but also the personality differences barack was exactly who he is and john mccain was exactly who he is they were exactly who i know them to be they are both friends of mine ive known them for some time with their answers barack is the thoughtful consensus builder he likes to nuance things he likes to talk things through you know hes a constitutional attorney john mccain is a straightforward happy commander who says yes yes no lets get it over lets do it by asking the same questions to each candidate it allowed america to compare apples to apples and i liked that
6089238 im afraid that that rumor might hurt the obama campaign ive talked to a number of people about this they say an anonymous source told me that john mccain was watching a monitor in his green room its flat out impossible in the first place there were secret service staff and saddleback church staff with mccain the entire time he was there there was no way he could have listened to anything without being seen if he had heard anything believe me i would have heard about it
6089239 this is not my day job my day job is im a pastor of a large church in california and im extremely involved in humanitarian efforts around the world all my time is taken up by that i have no aspirations to be a political consultant in any sense of the word

6089245 eso es una manipulaci n que se est tratado de hacer desde los medios privados es una de las pocas que les queda por montar y que a medida que pasa el tiempo est n cada vez m s desesperados por no lograr sus objetivos
6089246 lo que quiere es montar una matriz de opini n a nivel internacional ahora con el caso de los inhabilitados de que hay perseguidos pol ticos as como levantar una matriz de opini n de violaci n de los derechos humanos
6089247 lo que buscan es fabricar cualquier argumento y situaci n no la aclaran bien sino que la repiten varias veces para que se haga verdad
6089248 los sectores oposicionistas pretenden que los responsables de intento de asesinato intento de violaci n o asesinato de manera directa simplemente sean calificados como presos pol ticos para que haya impunidad y no haya ning n responsable sobre hechos en donde personas han perdido la vida y otras han quedado discapacitadas como el periodista jorge recio por la irresponsabilidad de estos agentes de polic as

6089269 exxon mccain 08 campaign kit complete with an oil barrel shaped stress ball
6089270 perhaps needless to point out the shape of the stress ball was also meant to underscore mr mccains contributions from oil companies on a day when he is visiting an oil rig in the gulf of mexico to promote his mantra of more offshore drilling now the facts are indisputable the best way to stand up for big oil is to vote exxon mccain 08 the press release from the democrats reads
6089271 it is clear that americas national security and economic leadership demand that we end our dangerous dependence on foreign oil the current energy crisis demonstrates that we need a comprehensive strategy that utilizes our domestic supply and encourages the promotion of clean renewable fuels

6089301 i thought that would be the end of my individual career
6089302 i thought the team sprint would be the only event i would have a realistic chance of medalling in i only really took up the other two events to improve my speed for the team event bizarrely its spiralled from there and now im world and olympic champion in both events and its crazy
6089303 to be olympic champion and to be olympic champion in four different events is fantastic and its still sinking in it has been incredible
6089304 you can spread yourself too thin and get yourself in trouble
6089305 the programme was favourable to me because i knew the team sprint would be first and thats the most controllable event i thought we could start off well win a medal and see how it goes but to win the gold in that took the pressure off and i was able to really relax make the most of it and enjoy it

6089309 employees should be encouraged to engage in physical activity on their lunch hours and breaks employers have long allowed smokers to step outside for 10 minutes for a cigarette break

6089317 a lot of the girls on the tour have already graduated id be the only one sitting around reading and doing homework i probably wouldnt focus too much
6089318 i think for americans we have more recreational numbers which is easier for the coaches to select the talented ones
6089319 china is more focused on the high level ones in china we dont have that many lower recreational kids

6089336 so i take it the press wont be allowed labour matters is supportive of labour but not an official labour party publication
6089337 leo was a passionate welshman and a fine constituency mp for the eastern valley which he represented in parliament for nearly 30 years i personally owe him a great debt and i know that mps from all sides of the house will mourn his passing
6089338 that is perhaps a tribute to how leo used his legal knowledge built up in his law practice leo abse and cohen and then applied it to his work in the house of commons in such a remarkable way
6089339 it is very rare for one mp to have been involved in so many major pieces of social legislation in relation to homosexuality divorce and abortion which have had a huge impact on the whole of british society
6089340 when i first joined the labour party in 1963 it was as a member of cardiff south east labour party whose full time office was in the attic above leo abse and cohen headquarters at 36 churchill way cardiff
6089341 his passing is a huge loss to politics and public life in wales and he will be fondly remembered in torfaen in cardiff and throughout britain
6089342 i have never met putin but i know mikhail saakashvili well
6089343 receiving the body and blood of christ unworthily is a sacrilege
6089344 if it is done deliberately in mortal sin it is a sacrilege
6089345 secondly there could be another form of scandal consisting of leading people to think that the public act that this person is doing which until now everyone believed was a serious sin is really not that serious if the church allows him or her to receive communion
6089346 if we have a public figure who is openly and deliberately upholding abortion rights and receiving the eucharist what will the average person think he or she could come to believe that it up to a certain point it is okay to do away with an innocent life in the mothers womb
6089347 it is not with the intention of interfering in public life but rather in the spiritual state of the politician or public official who if catholic should follow the divine law in the public sphere as well
6089348 every public school needs effective methods of discipline but beating kids teaches violence and it doesnt stop bad behavior
6089349 corporal punishment discourages learning fails to deter future misbehavior and at times even provokes it
6089350 when you talk to local school officials they point to the fact that its quick and its effective and thats true
6089351 it doesnt take much time to administer corporal punishment and you dont have to hire someone to run a detention or an after school program
6089352 we need forms of discipline that makes children understand why what they did was wrong
6089353 yeah surgeon med school no i met him before then

6089359 this course really assists consumers in better understanding their illness
6089360 it lets them hear the experiences of their peers and it empowers them and gives them the tools needed to assist not only themselves but others
6089361 ive never taught a class where the participants didnt come away with something
6089362 we get together and talk about recovery and living a healthy lifestyle for some of them its the first time they have opened up in a group setting
6089363 perhaps the most important thing we do is to help them develop a relapse prevention plan
6089364 when they share their stories it helps to get rid of the stigma and shame associated with mental illness people get to make friends during the course
6089365 it helps to show them where they can be it helps them to see that we the mentors have come from some of the same situations which they are in now weve taken this course and now we have come back to mentor

6089379 in the first half of this year more than 10 percent of visitors were international we hope we can gradually raise this for over the long term macau ought to develop the international market
6089380 obviously from a strategic point of view we feel this is a very good moment for us to not just pursue quantity but also to give a very good look at the quality of what were providing
6089381 strategy wise its very important for us to go for diversity
6089382 diversity in terms of product and diversity in terms of the markets we are pursuing so international markets will be very important in the future
6089383 with macaus improvements in terms of the number of hotels we can offer in terms of the transportation reorganization in actual fact the carrying capacity also changes over time
6089384 macaus economy is all import based what we can do is limited in the face of high global inflation

6089400 centrism is the philosophy of the american media and that essentially backs the status quo when youre a centrist and this game of objectivity that they play is really limited by parameters that youre allowed to ask questions and to investigate and in a sense then youre transmitting these assumptions and reinforcing every day that the us is really a functioning democracy not even a representative democracy and as we know of course there are oligarchic interests that buy off congress that puts the person in the whitehouse that they need

6089411 so we are pretty confident it was after the sponges split from trunk of the tree of life and sponges went one way and animals developed from the other that nerves started to form
6089412 what we found in sponges though were the building blocks for nerves something we never expected to find

6089415 the significance of our study is that it identifies smurf1 as the signaling partner through which tnf does damage in ra related bone loss
6089416 that has enabled researchers to begin designing small molecule drugs to shut down the action of smurf 1 and its relatives furthermore since mice engineered to have less smurf1 expression develop thicker bones future drugs that shut down smurf1 may be also useful against more common forms of osteoporosis simply by changing the dose of course this is early stage work with many obstacles ahead but it is exciting nonetheless

6089435 nuestro laicismo adem s es pura apariencia nuestra cultura de siglos es cat lica religiosa y es una necesidad del ser humano porque la funci n de la religi n es desterrar miedos y dar felicidad aunque las iglesias hayan invertido los t rminos
6089436 a cualquier ser humano creyente o no los temas de la trascendencia y del sufrimiento le afectan
6089437 por ello las manifestaciones art sticas y en concreto la literatura que abordan esos aspectos siempre interesan por su conexi n con esas zonas m s ntimas y profundas de las personas con los interrogantes e incertidumbres que todos llevamos dentro

6089731 ive seen situations where during an athletes tenure at the school he was injured and sidelined and we still honored the scholarship but this marks the first time i can recall when a young man was forced to retire before the start of his freshman year
6089732 there was never any question about us honoring his scholarship this is something we all know david could handle since he has that type of personality and courage
6089733 i think over the last three years the transformation he had made in his game was unbelievable
6089734 once he figured out what it took to improve his game he really began dedicating so much time to it he worked out with me every day went on a good nutritional program and turned himself into an elite athlete thats why having everything come to an end was so unfair
6089735 its great knowing that he will be using his time to educate others about hcm since not too many people know about it
6089736 if you can catch it early enough perhaps itll make a difference as it did with dave
6089737 he worked out with me every day went on a good nutritional program and turned himself into an elite athlete thats why having everything come to an end was so unfair

6089776 thats a really old fashioned idea its so low for someone to have said that they dont say that about men so its sexist and horribe
6089777 i may one day but it wont be because someone told me to i alsot think that the demographics of who sees movies have changed
6089778 women over 31 want movies that are about them so there are a lot of big surprises left the baby boom generation is getting older and it wants something more satisfying than why the movie makers expect

6089857 fine gael education spokesperson brian hayes raises a very important issue but his response is deeply misguided the problems in the education of our children are not caused by immigration but rather by a lack of investment in education
6089858 many parents are rightly worried about the education of their children and the amount of time teachers can spend with them however the problem arises from the governments failure to live up to its promise to reduce class sizes
6089859 smaller class sizes are proven to increase the learning ability of our children and this is where the governments focus should be the proposal to segregate non english speaking children is deeply misguided and could lead to an increase in racial tensions
6089860 the best way for these children to learn english is to be integrated with the other children who do speak english and to be taught through that medium

6089886 nunca me desesper s que es un equipo frondoso y con jugadores de primer nivel buscando su oportunidad y creo que todos trabajamos para eso estaba tranquilo porque el torneo es largo y que en cualquier momento tendr a mi oportunidad ojal y dios quiera iniciar ante necaxa

6089924 an absolute lack of faith in their ability to implement the security measures they have proposed
6089925 im not too sure whether they will keep replacing sides but nothing has come through to us
6089926 i think were free to play if it happens but personally i cant see it happening weve been called to pakistan recently to fill in for the aussies and well do it again if we get invited
6089927 there are external threats and there are internal threats the ability to actually secure the team once again we could probably point to a benazir bhutto situation to see whether the team could be secured
6089928 defensively we still have to improve but thats normal when you only have one day of preparation
6089929 not at all you have the organisation that was not good yet but we had one training session we have 10 days to work before uzbekistan and thats what we have to improve
6089930 the movement was excellent and overall some of the boys look really sharp
6089931 the way we try to play when weve got the ball means if we lose it were quite spread out and we have to get back into position as quickly as possible or we leave ourselves vulnerable
6089932 were now a team deep enough that if a harrys missing or a timmys missing or a duke is missing weve got people who can fill in
6089933 me and scotty do all right together i think with more time on the pitch together it will get even better
6089934 marks definitely a quality player i look up to him and can still learn a lot from him
6089935 i know what they can do and what they cant i will wait until training camp when i have everyone in the group then i can make my mind up i know what is the best combination on the field
6089936 i have my ideas for the first game but theres still three weeks to go
6089937 ryan obviously gives us a few things especially since hes a backrower that will play 80 minutes and theres not many of them
6089938 but jeremys been playing great all year though he probably wont get the 80 minutes and sikas been going very well
6089939 itll be a camp situation itll be a bit of a change of environment a change of surroundings for the players and hopefully that will help freshen things up
6089940 but we didnt want to play penrith have a bus trip back to the airport and then fly and do the same thing two days later
6089941 we just didnt turn up on the day and hopefully thats something that wont happen again this year its given us that big wake up call that we needed
6089942 we were disappointed with ourselves and thought we were a better team than that
6089943 what was worse than him ripping in is he didnt say much

6089956 as ive been hanging out in sydney and doing a lot of statistical research i hope ive got my understanding correct on some of the false views of jesus that permeate sydney to correct those with a view of jesus thats more biblical
6089957 i find sydney to be one of the most selfish cities ive ever seen in my whole life to be honest with you everything is about my personal happiness get married later or dont get married at all have children or dont have children at all go to church or dont go to church at all look out for your neighbour or dont look out for your neighbour whatever makes you happy yet statistically people are miserable anti depressants are up tenfold in the last decade everyones depressed everyones smoking nervous busy in debt scared lonely and living for themselves and havent realised that if you live for yourself you end up miserable
6089958 billy graham john stott ji packer and francis schaeffer fifty years ago they were the fathers the four horseman of evangelicalism i like to call them they really started a path that was glorious and in some ways has i think been abandoned prosperity gets in compromise on biblical authority gets in different issues creep in and i think its time to reclaim what it means to be a bible believing evangelical
6089959 theologically im classic protestant reformed evangelical so on the big issues i dont think i know of any differences between me and the sydney anglicans my view is also though that im a missionary so i go into culture trying to study and evaluate and try to plant churches in such a way that they fit the cultural context so id say maybe thats the difference between what i do and what traditional reformed theology did it tended to import from the dutch import from the british wherever it found its source and it brought in a lot of style and cultural baggage that i dont think is helpful
6089960 in my church im not a big deal theres a team about 30 of us now im out six weeks this summer when im out the other pastors preach the attendance has not gone down the giving has not gone down i dont run everything
6089961 the key is just keep talkin about jesus if youre talking about a homeless guy its hard to end up with prosperity theology jesus does enable some people to be rich so they can be very generous but theres nothing in the bible that says christians should expect health and wealth so i see that as a perverse gospel its a false gospel
