5040033 all of us kept telling each other we shouldnt be doing this
5040034 my mind set the whole time was why are we doing this
5040035 we immediately instituted a search for the defendant in order to absolve ourselves of liability
5040036 i got caught up in this i made a bad judgment im a screw up
5040037 asked what he did to earn an income roque reluctantly said he was a drug dealer
5040038 he said i dont fight or destroy people he said that he had a lot of friends and that they owed him
5040039 he portrayed himself as a modern day robin hood he said that he is known on the street as cuba he said that he helped people in various ways to include paying their rent and that his assistance was sometimes offered via illegal activities

5040045 roque agreed to assist on the condition that he could be at home with his daughters

5040053 the surrender shall be made to the facility in which the person was originally held in custody or the county or city jail affiliated with the court issuing the warrant resulting in bail

5040055 youve got a prosecutor who doesnt see the gray in the world
5040056 hes never worked on the other side to experience and understand the street smarts of it how things work the letter of the law doesnt necessarily incorporate the practical application of things

5040277 the sport of swimming will never be the same the name michael phelps will be synonymous with perfection
5040278 they have now gone into the realm of video game times
5040279 the sport of swimming will never be the same the name michael phelps will be synonymous with perfection
5040280 mrs phelps i promise you ill be ready for that relay sunday
5040281 eight for eight and in the 112 year history of the modern olympic games more than 100 000 athletes have competed in summer and winter games only one has won eight gold medals in a single olympics
5040282 that is the kind of feat that just may never be surpassed and certainly one of the greatest feats of sports history
5040283 what he did today and what he did this entire week beats the tour de france beats the pressure putt at the u s open you know it beats every part of what sport is and when you do something like that i mean you gotta tip your hat off to him every single athlete in the world right now needs to tip their hat off to michael phelps because what he did this week was absolutely amazing
5040284 im at more of a loss of words than yesterday it shows how much teamwork and how much togetherness we have it was a great experience for me and something ill have forever
5040285 you dont have to put an age limit on your dreams
5040286 i think i probably shouldnt have filed my nails last night
5040287 when you consider dara torres silver has never shown so brightly at 41 she was older than the combined ages of the gold and bronze medalists in the 50 free and though she couldnt quite catch her she then outswam australias libby trickett in the final leg of the medley relay a true performance for the ages meanwhile regarding her teammate michael phelps the numbers do not lie its beyond dispute hes the most prolific olympic champion ever is he the greatest thats subjective and there are cases to be made for other olympians across eras and across sports suffice it to say its difficult now to put anyone ahead of the 23 year old from baltimore in an age of specialization he swims all four strokes mark spitz as great as he was swam only the butterfly and the freestyle and phelps takes on all comers in a deep international field each one gunning straight for him hes not done yet as he figures to add to his medal haul four years from now in london and in doing so perhaps end the debate all together about this however there is no debate what phelps provided in beijing was more than just sustained excellence he provided the kind of theater that none of us will soon if ever will forget
5040288 watch your step there is a puddle of water here
5040289 they cling to guns or religion or apathy to people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
5040290 republicans are not very friendly to different kinds of people
5040291 if you look at folks of color even women howard
5040292 if there are any criticisms it comes out of love its like family
5040293 the republicans are not very friendly to different kinds of people were more welcoming to different folks

5040304 if it is determined that an individual acted improperly blackwater would support holding that person accountable
5040305 but at this stage without being able to review evidence collected in an ongoing investigation we will not prejudge the actions of any individual the company is cooperating fully with ongoing investigations and believes that accountability is important
5040306 does not apply to civilians working for federal departments or agencies other than dod the department of defense
5040307 if the contractors were not there those state department folks would be guarded by the military prosecutors could argue to the judge that those facts fit within the definition of furthering the defense department mission in iraq
5040308 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5040309 we obviously are going to have to re evaluate the direction of the strategic relationship with russia going forward and again that depends to a considerable extent on their behavior from this point forward
5040310 russia currently is not in compliance with that cease fire
5040311 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5040312 clearly as far as im concerned has the upper hand right now
5040313 i think we had seen them more as partners and there had been a lot of signals from putin that he was going to allow power to flow to stay with the president that medvedev would be in charge would be the person responsible for leading russia going forward the steps hes taken in the transition from president to prime minister in recent weeks and now certainly in georgia at least in my opinion bespeak more of putin having his hand on the steering wheel than anybody else
5040314 this looks frankly to me more like decisions made by the prime minister than by the president
5040315 if russia thought it was going to be able to bring down the georgia state bring down the democratic institutions it has failed
5040316 what theyve done instead is to bring down russias reputation as a potential and i want to emphasize potential partner in the international system
5040317 no one should try and force them back into a full relationship with georgia
5040318 if the russians intended this as intimidation they have done nothing but harden the attitudes of the small states around them
5040319 i think the russians have made a significant mistake here
5040320 it strikes me as pretty strident rhetoric and probably fairly empty rhetoric
5040321 the truth of the matter is russia is not going to launch nuclear missiles at anybody the poles know that we know it
5040322 the 65 000 new donors to the obama campaign demonstrate just how strongly the american people are looking to fundamentally change business as usual in washington
5040323 it was far less about religion and a lot more about values
5040324 on this particular issue if you believe that life begins at conception and you are consistent then i cant argue with you on that
5040325 what i can do is say are there ways we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies
5040326 for me as a christian it is a sacred union gods in the mix
5040327 i can afford those civil rights to others even if i dont have that view
5040328 i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5040329 john mccains going to be a much tougher opponent for barack obama in the debates than anybody ever might have imagined just a few weeks ago
5040330 for a minute there we were just two christians worshipping together
5040331 i thought barack obamas answer tonight was helpful to him and addressed a couple of things because theres been a lot of doubt about his christian faith
5040332 i think he also helped to dispel the myth that hes such an elitist and hes arrogant he was quite humble in that answer and many others
5040333 i was so obsessed with me and the reasons i might be dissatisfied i couldnt focus on other people
5040334 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
5040335 i dont think he was a strong enough jurist or a legal thinker at the time for that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation
5040336 this nomination should be based on the criteria of a proven record of strictly adhering to the constitution and not legislating from the bench
5040337 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view
5040338 hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me
5040339 informative energetic and entertaining this is a marvelous argument for corporate responsibility and accountability interesting to laypeople and instructive for executives

5040361 it was very surprising that these subjects would still have cells floating in their blood so long afterward
5040362 the antibodies that we isolated are remarkable antibodies they grab onto the virus very tightly and they virtually never fall off
5040363 the key importance of this is that it gives us a clear idea of the sorts of chemicals and mechanisms in the brain that are involved in bipolar disorder

5040368 when i first saw the sacred stool of galilee of course my immediate reaction was to shout heavens to betsy
5040369 if it can be conclusively verified that the fossilized remains did in fact once belong to christ the jesus feces will become perhaps the most important sacred relic in the entire christian world
5040370 you get a staph infection but touch it again and the staph infection goes away its truly miraculous
5040371 i dont know whether that particular bowel movement once belonged to christ or not nor do i know of any way to prove it one way or another but excrement human or otherwise usually decomposes very rapidly fossilized dung is really an archeological miracle in itself i dont see any need to ascribe it mystical powers
5040372 his holiness pope gregory xvii who was granted infallibility and a direct communication link with god following his election last year by the papal conclave in a five step runoff ballot
5040373 has pronounced that god in his infinite wisdom has assured his holiness the sacred stool belongs here in rome at the cradle and crux of the christian world where it will be protected and displayed in a marble water closet already under construction by our papal masons
5040374 his holiness is prepared to offer both the greek orthodox patriarchate and the ecumenical patriarchate unlimited visiting rights to the jesus feces
5040375 with a custody arrangement to be negotiated that would grant the two primary orthodox sees possession of the stool one weekend per month on alternate months
5040376 the pope is welcome to visit the inviolate log in the archdiocese of constantinople any time he wants
5040377 the jesus feces as the first genuine sacred artifact we know of that has passed through the actual body of the messiah is the closest any living man will ever get to the love mercy and healing powers of christ it belongs to us and were prepared to kill anyone who tries to keep it from us

5040384 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5040385 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5040386 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5040387 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5040388 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5040393 new orleans is of such key importance to american music because historical factors combined to make it the strongest center of african musical practice in the united states and cliches aside that practice really did travel up the mississippi and did spread overland
5040394 i heard a group called huey smith amp the clowns out of new orleans now this is where funk was really created thats where funk originated i couldnt understand how to do it so this drummer from huey smiths band hungry williams showed me how to play it
5040395 a lot of those new orleans drummers would come through and i got a lot of stuff from those guys tenoo coleman was as funky as any of them i learned some of that funk by listening to tennoo
5040396 at the risk of sounding egotistical a lot of the broken up stuff that these guys are playing now stems from the stuff that i had started doing
5040397 dont be fooled this city is deeply wounded id say its like an amputee with phantom memory
5040398 if there was no new orleans america would just be a bunch of free people dying of boredom

5040409 as such the government may only want to encourage the public transportation sector to use natural gas and could be announcing something in the upcoming budget to ensure this as such we urge car owners to be cautious

5040429 you hear that darling they want to see the finale and you can never dissapoint the audience right
5040430 i had been with john for about three years he was a really nice guy and i enjoyed being with him but there wasnt a ton of passion most everyone we knew had gotten engaged and though john would have proposed in a second whenever he brought it up id change the subject i took a trip to australia for work and while i was gone i got together with a co worker to whom id always been insanely attracted i had a fantastic trip probably because for the first time in a long time i experienced that excitement id been missing i broke up with john soon after i returned home and began dating the guy from the trip even though im not super proud of my actions things ended up for the best after dating for a few years the guy from the trip and i got married and were incredibly happy together
5040431 right before i was going to break up with my ex sean he found out that he had to put his beloved dog to sleep he was so broken up about it that i didnt have the heart to end things so i waited a month or so until he was in better shape when things seemed to be better and i was ready he lost his job so i felt like i was back to square one by that time i had met someone else that i really wanted to start seeing so i went ahead and did it i eventually ended things never telling sean about my extra curricular dating i think i rationalized that i was trying to spare his feelings
5040432 my boyfriend greg and i decided to do the long distance thing after i was accepted to a graduate program 200 miles from where we lived the first few months were fine but i soon found myself becoming extremely attracted to my lab partner henry what began as innocent flirting eventually wound up with us in bed after the program was over i returned home to greg being with him was really difficult but i didnt break up with him initially because i was still attracted to him too i visited henry a few times and realized that he was really more of a fling probably born out of boredom and that greg was the one for me i eventually stopped communicating with henry i never told greg about what happened which occasionally makes me feel guilty but i chalk my cheating up to being young and silly he and i are still together four years since my program ended
5040433 i began dating eric shortly after i had been dumped by dave my boyfriend of two years i was devastated and eric was definitely a rebound thing after eric and i had dated for five months dave came back and wanted to give things another shot i still really missed him so i began seeing him but never ended things with eric i think i sort of kept eric around for insurance purposes just in case things didnt end up well with dave dave and i didnt make it on round two and after eric discovered through mutual friends that i had been seeing him again he ended things with me i definitely learned my lesson about dating two guys at the same time not to mention trying to rekindle a relationship thats just plain over
5040434 when i was younger i dated a guy named ethan who was really critical of me he constantly made little snide comments about my weight how stupid i was and how clumsy i was for whatever odd reason i was into him despite the fact that all of my friends and family hated him one weekend when he was away i met will at a party and we completely hit it off he was the complete opposite of ethan kind sweet and generous yet completely cool and fun too we hung out all weekend and it was like a light bulb went off in my head this is how mature relationship worthy guys act i hooked up with will the night before he left and broke up with ethan soon after will and i dated for three years and now were married
5040435 im from florida so i adore going to the beach and boating but my former boyfriend chris a total city boy hated it we always argued about where wed take trips and he always won about eight months into our dating i took a trip to key west with my friends and we chartered a boat for the day the captain of the boat was this totally hot complete beach guy for life type and i spent the whole day flirting with him we met him out that night and he and i got together i never told chris about it after i got home and i never felt guilty i think part of me felt like thats what chris got for being so stubborn chris and i didnt make it and after we broke up i made sure any future boyfriends loved the beach
5040436 my last boyfriend was a total player before we got together i thought i could change him but i was wrong i always heard rumors that he was hooking up with other girls while we were dating but he always denied it one night i got a call from a girl he had been seeing and she detailed their three month long relationship to me and told me about another girl she had discovered he was seeing as well i was so mad that i went out with my friends that night dressed to kill and went home with the hottest guy i could find i felt like it was the least he deserved i loved seeing the look on his face when i told him about what i did and that i knew about the other girls and then i dumped him
5040437 its silly stuff this is not a timed sport and baseball is like going to a movie if its a good movie you stay if its horse sh t you get up and leave

5040463 i had expectations for myself its early and any injury im going to be upset or down im just going to get back in rehab and see what the problem is and try to fix it
5040464 they wanted it more than we did in the first half
5040465 we propose installing separate meters to measure natural gas used as fuel and as feedstock
5040466 we accept the higher rate of rm22 58 per mmbtu for gas used as fuel but when it comes to feedstock we hope the government will give due consideration to the nature of our industry
5040467 natural gas makes up a big part of our processing costs before the tariff hike it was 20 per cent now it is between 30 and 35 per cent
5040468 weve been the global market leader for the last 10 years for every four barrels of oleochemicals produced in the world one is made in and shipped out from malaysia
5040469 until recently lower gas price was the only advantage we could use to partially offset the expensive palm kernel oil in malaysia this raw material is significantly cheaper in indonesia because the indonesian government imposes export tax on palm kernel oil
5040470 also our exports to china are effectively shut out by the chinese governments import duty on oleochemicals
5040471 we need a lead time of 12 months because the quantum of increase is very large and most of our clients order forward by three to six months
5040472 do your best on and off the field do not take shortcuts
5040473 pledge not to cheat in sports in life and in school
5040474 this is due both to the electricity tariff and petrol and diesel prices increases transport costs are also likely to rise compounded by the increase in toll charges at the start of the year
5040475 food inflation may stay elevated in july following the recent commodity boom but could moderate slightly going forward given the sharp fall in commodity prices which began in mid july
5040476 apart from that we look for pressures to sustain in both the housing and utilities as well as the transport components amid the fact that the economy is still in an adjustment period after the subsidy cuts
5040477 it worked out better than i thought it would not that i thought it would go badly
5040478 it was like starting all over again i had some feelings that i havent felt in 17 years but thats a good thing
5040479 i felt like i threw the ball well moved around ok
5040480 ive been throwing the ball well i just feel like once i get the timing down with these guys ill be ok
5040481 there were a lot of things to appreciate in the performance tonight in that we didnt just pack it in and say lets go home
5040482 it was a little weird but for the most part i felt comfortable in this uniform
5040483 i feel comfortable in this locker room i had numerous people on the redskins team say man it almost dont look right but its got to start looking right
5040484 we all wanted to see him in a different uniform a new place and to see how he reacted
5040485 very much in control of the huddle like he always is and very much in control of the game and that allowed us to be in control as an offense as a unit we felt like everything that we were going to run was going to work
5040486 i dont have one yet but i think ill build one just for that
5040487 we aim to double our revenue from this region by 2011 to achieve the target we have to grow at an annual rate of 26 per cent over the next three years
5040488 every area of our asia pacific business reported double digit revenue growth in particular our consulting and financial advisory services continued to grow by more than 40 per cent in asia pacific
5040489 we still have work to do during good and bad times for example when the economy is not doing well our financial advisory business segment will see a pick up in restructuring jobs and winding down of companies
5040490 on the other hand it may have an impact on our consulting service especially in the field of information technology it thats because when things slow down companies generally scale back their it spending
5040491 we expect our clients in asia pacific will continue to grow principally because of the worlds two big emerging economies china and india
5040492 i am never afraid if we are behind because it means that we can only gain market position
5040493 in instances where there is collusion between employees in an organisation it becomes extremely difficult for both internal and external auditors to detect
5040494 one of the steps that we have taken was to get a partner from our global technical network based here to help look at all our malaysian firms technical standards the way it does audits and so on
5040495 he has been here since april 2008 and our intention is to have him here for at least the next two to three years to help our malaysian firm improve its internal processes
5040496 we are planning to make malaysia the centre of excellence for our islamic finance initiative in asia pacific we will be bringing in experts who can advise on structuring islamic compliant products and investments as well as those who understand accounting and taxation of islamic finance
5040497 we plan to later link it up with our london and bahrain practices to serve our global islamic finance initiative
5040498 the companies act 1965 gives the auditors powers i think we have enough powers already without adding any more to the list we just need to make sure that we do a good job and get to the right answers
5040499 for example getting a qualified account is a big thing because what it is saying to the public is that we the auditors have looked at the companys accounts and could not conclude that they are true and fair
5040500 to the audited companys shareholders and management this is a big deal because it is similar to failing in their audit
5040501 just look at btmh in its audit of oilcorp bhds 2007 financial accounts it said that it didnt agree with management on the financial statements
5040502 every time something like this happens the auditors run the risk of losing their clients which was what happened to btmh the oilcorp management had wanted to remove btmh as external auditors of the company
5040503 as such i believe that the auditors will always take their jobs seriously because when they issue a qualified audit opinion they know that they will run the risk of losing their clients
5040504 singapore also has a similar process where the regulators periodically review the files of the accounting firms that audit listed companies malaysia is in the process of setting up a similar procedure
5040505 there is a commitment to fully align itself with ifrs by 2012
5040506 today the few countries that are fully aligned with ifrs are singapore hong kong australia south africa and european countries like the uk
5040507 not necessary at the end of the day it boils down to good management
5040508 even in singapore that fully complies with ifrs there are fraud cases most importantly the companys management must exercise a high level of integrity and honesty

5040516 its because people get to know us better find out so much more information about us giving us more exposure readers feel like they have a connection to us personally
5040517 sometimes theres a story you really want to write something you want to say and its so rare for fans to get the athletes perspectives on the competition what were thinking and feeling at the moment
5040518 those are the blog entries that get the most readers
5040519 ive been able to reach friends and family in peru and have received support from peruvians around the world
5040520 as an athlete thats what i need support from people around the world most comments i get come from the blogs about my personal experiences
5040521 lenovos goal with this blogger program is to give athletes a starting point for discussions and sharing of ideas and experiences about the olympic games
5040522 it isnt really a program about making millions of impressions in the traditional marketing sense its about making thousands of connections between athletes and fans
5040523 if you think this is wrong youre probably a racist

5040551 this junior olympic team was coached by adam payan over the winter and early spring and over the last two months by my brother dan cherrie
5040552 it s a huge zone to compete in with a lot of talent
5040553 we qualified seventh in the zone and at junior olympics we moved up to fourth in the zone standings
5040554 the amazing thing about ventura at this time is that we have enough talent right here at home to compete with the best
5040555 a fine example is team member clint howard center offense who was named to the junior olympics all american honorable mention team
5040556 in two games we were one defensive stop away from winning and finishing in the top 10 we played young and are learning so much and we want to win every game
5040557 i think one of the most important lessons i want our players to take past the game is that our culture is one that rewards competitors
5040558 it is important to always look for ways to better yourself not to rest on your past accomplishments talents or entitlements or whatever every day you take off get sick or go half speed someone else is passing you making excuses for yourself really limits your ability to grow and improve
5040559 the u s junior olympics tournament was a great experience for many reasons
5040560 we played 11 more summer games together against very good teams and we also learned that we can compete with the very best there are techniques and strategies we need to work on as a team but this experience was a great confidence builder
5040561 at school they all eat together and it is really nice to see they are like family and we have a very supportive group of parents who are constantly offering their time and talents to help these boys succeed
5040562 we have a bright future since everyone who played this year is eligible to play in the same category and on the same team next year
5040563 we are only going to get better because the guys are young and love the game
5040564 practices that restrict natural motion such as sow gestation crates induce high levels of stress in the animals and threaten their health which in turn may threaten human health

5040577 i was sitting down having a cigarette and he spotted me and made a beeline to me
5040578 he got all of his security to close in so johnny couldn t get to me
5040579 so we were encircled and hes like how are you doing little lady
5040580 and i said happy birthday frank and he just lunged for me
5040581 he kissed me on the lips then gave me a filterless cigarette i came off all lightheaded he was fabulous
5040582 the triad appears to have prevailed because of old fashion capitalism that values its more centralized location its moving up in stature as a cargo center as the fedex hub nears completion logistics today magazine in its rating of the 50 top logistics friendly cities and metropolitan areas ranked greensboro high point tops in the state and 20th in the southeast last year up from 31st in 2005 it passed charlotte gastonia concord which slipped from 18th in the southeast in 2005 to 22nd raleigh cary came in 28th in the southeast in the latest ranking
5040583 we welcome it we need it the workers deserve it
5040584 this is an important day this is an example for the nation
5040585 i dont know why obama chooses to insult a supreme court justice at a religious forum but his comments that justice thomas was not qualified to be on the court were revealing why would obama think given his own credentials that he was better qualified for president than clarence thomas was for the supreme court
5040586 theres going to be turmoil then we are really heading for trouble some mad chap might think these fellows have failed now im taking over those are the risks you run
5040587 im not sure that the zimbabweans are not going to start fighting then we are all in trouble theres no option but to agree the consequences are too ghastly to contemplate
5040588 we have agreed that mr mugabe will be president whilst i become prime minister a prime minister cannot be given responsibility without authority and be expected to deliver
5040589 we envisage that the prime minister must chair the cabinet and be responsible for the formulation execution and administration of government business including appointing and dismissing his ministers
5040590 no deal in the short term is better than a bad deal
5040591 see reason to see failure to agree implies catastrophe for zimbabwe
5040592 over the years the political situation may have been bad the crunch has now come
5040593 the country is melting economically i dont think mr mugabe can fail to see that if he sees that and being the patriot that i believe he is he must have only one answer that the zimbabweans look up to him and the other leaders of the political parties to find a resolution
5040594 they are equals and they ought to be treated as such neither one of them has won the presidential election
5040595 to sit down with mugabe or his ministers we have said no those who break all these rules should not expect to sit at the same table with us before the situation is corrected
5040596 ik heb twee dagen diensten meegedraaid bij een tbs kliniek ik wilde weten hoe die zorg is georganiseerd het was heel zinvol en indrukwekkend ik had vooraf de voorstelling dat het er meer als een gevangenis zou uitzien maar dat was niet zo deze mensen hebben natuurlijk hun straf al uitgezeten zorg staat daarom centraal

5040600 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5040601 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5040602 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5040603 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5040604 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5040605 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5040606 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5040607 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5040608 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5040609 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5040610 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5040611 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5040612 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5040613 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5040614 and of course those solutions are service oriented its 2008

5040617 the last straw for the police was when a really good song came on a boom box that this guy was holding on his shoulder a few feet away from me the cops must have known that something sinister was taking place because there were at least 10 people dancing to the music then a cop grabbed the guy with the boom box by the back of his arm and yanked him into the street pushing him to the ground and making him loose grip of the stereo now i know that dancing is illegal and also a sin but i think there was excessive force used in this situation the stereo fell batteries flying everywhere and when a few of his friends picked it up a woman cop angrily lunged for the boom box and tried to further dismantle it
5040618 we never stopped we just kept on pushing every stroke
5040619 in athens it was a very hard fought race it was one where we were behind and we had to fight back here we dominated and that is such a testament to what a great crew this was
5040620 i knew that prilukov could catch me because he did in the 400 freestyle
5040621 we started with everything we could in the first 500 to get ourselves into the race essentially through the middle its a dogfight and everybody wants a piece of it
5040622 we knew that we had a really solid 500 and it was just a matter of not waiting for it but going everyone together we closed our eyes and went for it
5040623 we had to find a little something extra to get beyond them
5040624 our goal was to have a really solid first 1 500 in our previous races weve gotten caught a few times we really wanted to put together a solid last 500

5040633 the second launch of the safir rocket carrying the first satellite omid was conducted successfully
5040634 the achievement has drawn much attention from around the world especially from among muslim nations as iran is under heavy sanctions by the west and the un security council making it develop the technology and build every part and equipment needed in the field of aerospace
5040635 this satellite the rocket and the launch station are entirely iranian built achieved by particularly talented scientists and technicians
5040636 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5040637 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

5040642 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5040643 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5040644 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects

5040653 si te ves obligado a vivir como lo hace la clase media lo haces
5040654 yo no tengo ninguna duda que brasil puede llegar a hacer lo mismo que los equipos que enfrentamos hasta ahora en los juegos es m s lo han hecho en los ltimos tres partidos y lamentablemente les ha dado resultados
5040655 si enfrente tenemos un equipo mezquino no tenemos que volvernos locos en todo caso tendremos que ser mezquinos igual que ellos y tener el mismo cuidado de ellos en los ltimos partidos hasta en brasil ellos jugaron de esa manera por eso no me sorprender a que lo vuelvan a hacer
5040656 nosotros tenemos que ser inteligentes y no cometer errores porque jugando contra equipos que apuestan todo a una contra si te equivoc s lo termin s pagando muy caro
5040657 contra holanda empezamos muy bien y por una distracci n se nos complic el partido tenemos que estar muy atentos porque despu s se cierran todos atr s y se hace muy dif cil entrar algo que nos desgasta mucho
5040658 nosotros sab amos que holanda no iba a salir a atacarnos pero no nos imagin bamos que se iban a meter todos atr s como lo hicieron de manera tan mezquina

5040667 it will be a pleasant surprise for a lot of kiwis it has always been difficult to bring savings back but this agreement will make it much easier
5040668 to have that level of open support from australia is an extremely positive step

5040670 oh fucking god thats fucking lame hes such a fucking fuck
5040671 damn if i were that fat id take a shotgun to my head gee that made me feel really good by the way i do notice the dagger looks that are shot at me just for being fat and having the audacity to enjoy going out for dinner and the look of disbelief on peoples faces when i order a salad at a restaurant as if to say

5040677 we had a phone call from st john ambulance about 2 45am
5040678 they phoned back and said things are not so good so we need to have it happen now
5040679 if you had a four wheel drive and you knew how to use it you were all right
5040680 one of the hairier moments was stopping on the hill next to these cars to check if anyone was inside and hoping the car wouldnt slide backwards
5040681 they had good quality sleeping bags theyd settled down for the night
5040682 its a good illustration that down here we rely a lot on teamwork
5040683 the partners at johnnys acknowledged from the beginning they wanted to tie up the space if it was to be vacated to ensure another burger hot dog place didnt move in next door
5040684 i dont want another store restaurant selling something similar setting up shop next door and take those evil street venders and confine them in some woebegotten corner of downtown where they cant interfere with my business
5040685 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5040686 we obviously are going to have to re evaluate the direction of the strategic relationship with russia going forward and again that depends to a considerable extent on their behavior from this point forward
5040687 russia currently is not in compliance with that cease fire
5040688 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5040689 clearly as far as im concerned has the upper hand right now
5040690 i think we had seen them more as partners and there had been a lot of signals from putin that he was going to allow power to flow to stay with the president that medvedev would be in charge would be the person responsible for leading russia going forward the steps hes taken in the transition from president to prime minister in recent weeks and now certainly in georgia at least in my opinion bespeak more of putin having his hand on the steering wheel than anybody else
5040691 this looks frankly to me more like decisions made by the prime minister than by the president
5040692 if russia thought it was going to be able to bring down the georgia state bring down the democratic institutions it has failed
5040693 what theyve done instead is to bring down russias reputation as a potential and i want to emphasize potential partner in the international system
5040694 no one should try and force them back into a full relationship with georgia
5040695 if the russians intended this as intimidation they have done nothing but harden the attitudes of the small states around them
5040696 i think the russians have made a significant mistake here
5040697 it strikes me as pretty strident rhetoric and probably fairly empty rhetoric
5040698 the truth of the matter is russia is not going to launch nuclear missiles at anybody the poles know that we know it
5040699 neutralizing antibodies derived from the b cells of 1918 influenza pandemic survivors
5040700 ninety years after survivors encountered the 1918 pandemic influenza virus we collected antibody producing b cells from them and successfully isolated b cells that produce antibodies that block the viral infection
5040701 the antibodies produced by these cells demonstrated remarkable power to block 1918 flu virus infection in mice proving that even nine decades after infection with this virus survivors retain protection from it
5040702 the fact that you can isolate these anti 1918 memory b cells so long after infection will hopefully provide the impetus to further study the mechanisms behind long lived immunity
5040703 our findings show that survivors of the pandemic have highly effective virus neutralizing antibodies to this powerful virus and humans can sustain circulating b memory cells to viruses for up to 9 decades after exposure
5040704 these findings could serve as potential therapy for another 1918 like virus
5040705 this work demonstrates that we can get a complete genome for a totally unknown organism
5040706 we extracted a complete genome from a very complex community and this is something novel
5040707 you can only use amplification when you know what youre trying to get and thats the problem
5040708 when you want to discover something unknown amplification is a very deficient technique because you keep discovering the things you already know so how can you discover the unknown
5040709 these are the bacteria that maintain the earths health some of the methane escapes in some parts of the lake you can see the bubbles but whatever doesnt escape as bubbles these bacteria do a very good job of eating it

5040716 an engrossing evocative debut novel that will grab most readers from its opening sentences fans of hard hitting uncompromising private investigators will hope that donne ditches his college dreams and continues to pound the pavement
5040717 white manages the neat trick of respecting the genres traditions while daring to nudge it toward something new and unexpected
5040718 a unique and artful blend of the pi novel and the police procedural with a story as deceptively simple as your first love and as fatal as your last car wreck a terrific novel
5040719 its the great american private eye novel reborn for the 21st century with a fast moving spare style that punches you in the gut at the same time it squeezes your heart
5040720 when one man dies barrels straight out of the old school and swerves onto the highway that will take detective fiction where its going next dave white has one hand on the wheel the other on the gear shift and his foot on the floor

5040723 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5040724 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5040725 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5040726 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5040727 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5040728 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5040729 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5040730 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5040731 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5040732 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5040733 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5040734 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5040735 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5040736 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5040737 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5040738 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5040739 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5040740 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5040741 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5040742 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5040743 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5040744 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5040745 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5040746 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5040747 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5040748 who are open to doing something on the production side
5040749 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5040750 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5040751 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5040752 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5040753 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5040754 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5040755 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5040756 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
5040757 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5040758 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5040759 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5040760 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5040761 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5040762 and hed be like man the pizza is good today
5040763 i just wanted to make sure i took every single moment in and every single swim in every single moment with my teammates so i would remember them
5040764 to swim in the same era as him has been awesome
5040765 weve been talking about mark spitz for 36 years now
5040766 i dont know if im going to be alive when they stop talking about this bloke you wonder if we are going to see someone as good as this again
5040767 being able to have something like that to shoot for it made those days when i was tired and i didnt want to be there
5040768 im just thankful for him having done what he did
5040769 the sport of swimming has come a long way so far and i think it can go even further
5040770 mike is opening a lot of doors with what hes doing
5040771 i just want to lay in my own bed for five minutes at least and just relax
5040772 one of the things im really looking forward to is getting back to baltimore
5040773 hes more naturally suited for longer distances itll be change for him but i think itll be a good one
5040774 when we train every day sometimes there are workouts you dont like dont want to do bob says youre putting money in the bank
5040775 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop
5040776 it was magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 percent wide open
5040777 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5040778 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5040779 we historically dont make our decisions within a 24 hour period it takes time to get everybody in a group and talk about it
5040780 let me just say that first and foremost that that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys there at jgr
5040781 i want to apologize to nascar to our partners to toyota guys a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5040782 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were
5040783 for us we kind of feel like in the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and chief engine builder mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5040784 the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped to come back and win it again thats awesome
5040785 thats a great story that wasnt able to be told
5040786 well figure out exactly what happened and those that were responsible
5040787 theres going to be punishment for that thats just part of life you cant do that
5040788 i found out about it halfway through the day session last night when i went over there to see what was going on
5040789 i was surprised to see what was happening and astonished and frankly incredulous i couldnt believe it was happening because its clearly defined in the entry forms that you dont do this sort of thing
5040790 but im sure joe and j d will take care of that internally and whatever fans think theyre going to think were just going to keep working on our stuff
5040791 its not something that you like to hear about and you have to just question every chassis dyno thats ever been run on every toyota
5040792 you look at the no 32 car of brian vickers and red bull racing the 32 and the 18 and the 20 made about the same power the first run on the dyno when they took the magnet or whatever this device was out of the 18 and the 20 they both came up
5040793 what i dont know is if its a toyota problem if its a joe gibbs thing how widespread is it and how long has it been going on because a lot of whats been done by nascar has been based on the chassis dyno results

5040839 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5040840 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5040841 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5040842 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5040843 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5040844 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5040845 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5040846 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5040847 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5040848 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5040849 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5040850 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5040851 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5040852 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5040853 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5040854 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5040855 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5040856 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5040857 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5040858 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5040859 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5040860 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5040861 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5040862 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5040863 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5040864 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

5040870 how does it become a man to behave toward this american government to day i answer that he cannot without disgrace be associated with it i cannot for an instant recognize that political organization as my government
5040871 this could indicate that there is a new generation of militants in xinjiang
5040872 coming as it does around the olympics it appears that some of the locals are sending a message that they do not support the central governments policies in the region
5040873 if uighurs do not get the good jobs it is because they do not have the brains or education
5040874 if we were independent we would be a poor small country that everyone would push around
5040875 my new house is nicer than the traditional mud house i lived in but i have no way to make a living now
5040876 for uighurs to get ahead you have to act chinese and forget your ethnic distinctiveness
5040877 there is a sort of aggregator effect from all these years of crackdown on the uighur population
5040878 it makes it hard for the eu to give support to china when most of their diplomatic activities are lobbying us to prevent the activities of groups that have no terrorist links but which china sees as a threat to the communist party
5040879 there is some evidence showing that behind these attacks there might be east turkestan forces
5040880 the attacks are more likely to be by separatist groups
5040881 religion might be a cover but separatism is their main purpose
5040882 there has definitely been a rise in islamic conservatism in xinjiang
5040883 but i have not seen signs of real support for global jihad or for islamic radicalism
5040884 these do not appear to be acts of some terrorist organisation which is being planned from the other side of the border
5040885 we do not have a lot of information but it looks more like personal grievances of people who are using the olympics to do something

5040933 once facts like that are out there in the media it can hurt the case by possibly deterring potential witnesses and others from coming forward

5041054 its my marabout that did this to me it forged me it allowed me to learn that i can overcome difficulty

5041056 ask yourself what is this money used for the kids are not fed so its not for food they wear rags so its not for clothes they dont have mattresses so its not for their beds
5041057 this is a sham on a grand scale under the cover of religion
5041058 the parents of these children believe in these men so completely that when they hand over their sons they relinquish all control
5041059 they swear allegiance to the marabout and say that whatever happens to their son is for the childs good

5041079 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5041080 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation

5041083 frankly we dont trust the iraqi police one hundred percent
5041084 when the aug 8 bomb went off in tal afar the police joined with the civilians to attack sunnis when we didnt join the fight they called us terrorists
5041085 as the iraqi units stood up over the past 18 months they took over our bases
5041086 we confirmed that they could operate in company and battalion strength
5041087 security forces want to focus on the true fight right now but they are forced into a
5041088 but in my view your face is not everything real beauty lies inside a person not outside
5041089 because beauty is all about faces and beautiful girls and skin
5041090 help us bring back a smile to the face of these survivors
5041091 they say that when we come to a beauty salon we come with the expectation that were going to be relaxed in a different frame of mind
5041092 if we come here and we see someone who has gone through so much pain and misery so automatically that gives us that low feeling also they have a point
5041093 at the same time there are clients who take pride in asking these girls to give them a blow dry or getting a manicure or pedicure taken from them
5041094 once we had a wedding in the family i went there and all the girls were getting dressed and putting on makeup so that time i felt a pain in my heart
5041095 but i dont want to weaken myself with these thoughts
5041096 the peace of mind i have now i never had before i suffered much more mental anguish in my married life
5041097 i feel that her hands call me again and again

5041114 i was very surprised to learn i was the millionth delivery for pods
5041115 i first learned of pods when i saw a container parked at a neighbor s home and thought it was an awesome idea to have a pods container on site during our own home remodel
5041116 now that pods has given us storage for one year it will be great to take a little more time to go through our things as we settle back into our home
5041117 we applaud habitat for humanity of greater los angeles in helping families reach their goal of homeownership and look forward to our partnership
5041118 our chapter has worked with pods for the last two years and is always a great help to our organization
5041119 the biggest benefit to using pods is that we can load all of our materials at the warehouse and have it on the jobsite for easy access by our volunteers which streamlines our logistics and moves the build along much quicker
5041120 pods has been a huge part of our success and in making dreams come true for many families
5041121 pods provides unique benefits for people who need to move or store their belongings for their home or business
5041122 our popular white containers offer increased flexibility convenience and control over expensive moving companies or rental trucks that is why we have over 92 customer satisfaction it is exciting to see this new combination of moving and storage grow
5041123 with habitat we build more than just houses we build families community and hope
5041124 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop
5041125 it was magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 percent wide open
5041126 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5041127 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5041128 we historically dont make our decisions within a 24 hour period it takes time to get everybody in a group and talk about it
5041129 let me just say that first and foremost that that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys there at jgr
5041130 i want to apologize to nascar to our partners to toyota guys a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5041131 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were
5041132 for us we kind of feel like in the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and chief engine builder mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5041133 but in my view your face is not everything real beauty lies inside a person not outside
5041134 unfortunately 9 11 changed the way the world thinks about their vulnerability aboard airliners tokyo madrid and london further illustrated that the rails and buses were not immune from terrorist attack
5041135 our goal is to make certain we coordinate to the fullest extent possible with our law enforcement partners including first responders and wmd experts we want to ensure preparedness in combating the growing threat of transportation sector terrorism
5041136 counterterrorism today is a team activity tsas strategy is to start with intelligence partner with law enforcement airports our international colleagues and industry partners and the public and use security measures that are flexible widely deployable mobile and layered to cover our open transportation network if the terrorists strength is that they have no deadlines rules or borders ours is that this is our turf there are a lot of us and we have a lot of resources
5041137 im surprised its a little bit late for a trade

5041139 sometimes guys just have off years i think that happens its a part of the game hes certainly healthy and i think a change of scenery will help him
5041140 i think going to a pennant race will help him
5041141 i cant say enough good things about luis he took the ball for us anytime he was asked and did a phenomenal job his entire career hell be missed
5041142 theyre fighting for first place so im going to do my best to clear my mind and try to help the bullpen
5041143 he attacked the hitters i kind of expect the same thing plus hes experienced thats important
5041144 he had requested to be traded this year throughout the year
5041145 we attempted to do so by the trade deadline and just were not able to make a deal that made sense for us with a month and a half left before free agency we felt we needed to get something for him
5041146 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
5041147 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
5041148 a country that has the capacity to project dominating power and influence anywhere in the world and sometimes in more than one region of the globe at a time and so may plausibly attain the status of global hegemon
5041149 we do not intend to attack anyone but we consider it necessary for all our partners in the world community to clearly understand that to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of russia and its allies military forces will be used including preventively including with the use of nuclear weapons
5041150 moscow has boosted military spending as part of an effort to make russia more assertive on the world stage after the chaos of the post soviet period it has also tried to reform its military to create a more professional well equipped and mobile army

5041173 with many immigrants there is this sense that they made this hard choice to leave their homelands and they are going to make it under any cost
5041174 i think theres a tendency to see the positive even under the most dire circumstances because so much is at stake theyve left family family members are counting on them and they want to make this work
5041175 when we became aware that there was a naming process

5041177 we cannot stand idly by and wait for market forces or the electricity good fairy to solve this problem for us

5041239 alterations in brain serotonin levels have been linked to several mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety

5041241 the b cells have been waiting for at least 60 years if not 90 years for that flu to come around again
5041242 thats amazing because its the longest memory anyones ever demonstrated
5041243 these are some of the most potent antibodies ever isolated against a virus
5041244 the lessons we are learning about the 1918 flu tell us a lot about what may happen during a future pandemic
5041245 neutralizing antibodies derived from the b cells of 1918 influenza pandemic survivors
5041246 ninety years after survivors encountered the 1918 pandemic influenza virus we collected antibody producing b cells from them and successfully isolated b cells that produce antibodies that block the viral infection
5041247 the antibodies produced by these cells demonstrated remarkable power to block 1918 flu virus infection in mice proving that even nine decades after infection with this virus survivors retain protection from it
5041248 the fact that you can isolate these anti 1918 memory b cells so long after infection will hopefully provide the impetus to further study the mechanisms behind long lived immunity
5041249 our findings show that survivors of the pandemic have highly effective virus neutralizing antibodies to this powerful virus and humans can sustain circulating b memory cells to viruses for up to 9 decades after exposure
5041250 these findings could serve as potential therapy for another 1918 like virus

5041276 it gives mccain a bounce most social conservatives want to know that he has a faith in god but what they are looking for is where that leads him to stand on the issues
5041277 its important to keep in mind that while mccain has had some differences with evangelical leaders in the past he has reached out to them
5041278 he is strongly pro life and so on this signature social issue he is very consistent with evangelical perspectives
5041279 the campaign is starting to look more like 2004 than we expected it to look like the map still favors obama but mccain has made some gains the last six weeks

5041289 as a result northern ireland water was able to deploy resources and contractors throughout the event and around the clock
5041290 nevertheless such was the extremity of the rainfall that hundreds of homes were affected
5041291 im happy but im back on training because i might come back in september to defend my belt i passed a week with my family and it was great but im back here att now
5041292 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it
5041293 we also recognize that someone who lives say in the lakes region may know nothing about the greater nashua area
5041294 for example our ambassadors could work with st joseph hospital and a candidate from dartmouth college in hanover
5041295 you know our country is a child compared to china to them were not even a teenager were a toddler running around saying mine mine mine
5041296 even though it wasnt an olympic event it was what these games are all about sports and friendship before politics
5041297 ya se la entregamos a la direcci n de servicios p blicos y la van a empezar a utilizar dentro de una semana apenas la acabamos de terminar y pensamos que va a ser suficiente para captar la basura que se va a generar en los ltimos meses del a o porque estamos recolectando 50 toneladas diariamente

5041299 pero se requiere una inversi n muy importante por eso estamos haciendo el proyecto para solicitar el apoyo del gobierno del estado y de la federaci n para lograr esta obra nosotros ya hicimos una inversi n en la adquisici n del terreno
5041300 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5041301 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5041302 faulty and fraudulent appraisals were an important contributor to the losses that the federal government suffered during the saving and loan crisis
5041303 we got to this point by a lack of enforcement the public has the right to expect the appraisal boards are taking care of that problem
5041304 do you know what that would have meant the net effect is it would have effectively shut down mortgage lending in that state
5041305 to take that action would have been an unbelievable disruption to the economy i wasnt going to do that

5041314 no se perder n m s d as de clase
5041315 un d a de clase tiene un valor incalculable y perderlo puede ser irrecuperable
5041316 las tomas de escuelas hacen perder d as de clase perjudican a la gran mayor a de los alumnos complican la organizaci n de las familias e impiden la tarea de educar de maestros y profesores
5041317 no se puede permitir que una situaci n minoritaria afecte a todos los estudiantes hay un punto donde hay que arreglar las cosas durante mucho tiempo esto se dej hacer como si no hubiera estado pero hay que proteger el inter s de la mayor a de los alumnos
5041318 well i saw that commercial too but berle i dont think it was real i think it was a kind of fantasy take on biofuels
5041319 no damn way it wast ge for christ sake not disney this is what obaman me are all about real energy solutions for america and now our biggest electric company has biofuels from chinese dragons that aint fantasy choke that is smart ge scientists at work not like the nerds from exxonmobil in their commercials talking about how goood it is for young people being scientists and saying that cant solve malaria and all this is about real honest to goodness dragon energy and you cant handle it because you are so caught up in your last century oil thinking just a denier is all a denier of dragon energy
5041320 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5041321 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5041322 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5041323 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5041324 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5041325 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5041326 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5041327 if mohammedans wish to stay in holland then they must tear out half the korans pages and throw them away according to him in the mohammedans holy book there are printed enough terrible things he again makes a case that islam is a violent religion if mohammed lived here today i would propose to chase him out of the country with tar and feathers says he about the prophet of islam
5041328 syed imam shah was a famous ismaili dai in india
5041329 it is better not to have a deal than to have a bad deal
5041330 yet again the russian president has given his word and i hope this time he will honor it
5041331 any notion that russia was the kind of responsible state that is ready to integrate into international institutions of the political diplomatic security economic kind this forward leaning modern russia that reputation is frankly in tatters
5041332 we clearly have seen a side of russia that we had hoped was a thing of the past and we obviously are going to have to re evaluate the direction of the strategic relationship with russia going forward
5041333 and that depends to a considerable extent on their behavior from this point forward
5041334 hitler didnt snub me it was franklin d roosevelt who snubbed me the president didnt even send me a telegram
5041335 we are still a very long ways off before we could create something to harness that type of energy
5041336 workers democracy workers control of the state owned enterprises democratization of education and politics
5041337 the chinese celebrate their roaring economy as they struggle with its costs near universal optimism about beijing olympics
5041338 another few weary steps and there was nothing above us but the sky
5041339 to this day it thrills me to know that if i can get the program right it will always work perfectly every time just the way i told it to experiencing this thrill was the beginning of my fascination with software
5041340 theres nothing like the eureka moment of discovering something that no one knew before i wont compare it to sex but it lasts longer
5041341 my feet are still on the ground im just wearing better shoes
5041342 ive read that i flew up the hills and mountains of france but you dont fly up a hill you struggle slowly and painfully and maybe if you work very hard you get to the top ahead of everybody else
5041343 what is behind it is the years of passion and dedication and hard work
5041344 being near or at the top certainly requires an enormous amount of time and effort and it doesnt come without collateral cost
5041345 its not a 9 to 5 job something elsewhere is going to have to suffer
5041346 as i stood in front of all of you for years in victory i stand in front of you today
5041347 ah how could i possibly admit such an infirmity in the one sense which should have been more perfect in me than in others
5041348 soon i would have to deal with something i had not known in my entire life pressure the pressure to defend my position the pressure to carry myself like a man and champion the pressure to meet demands and obligations that came with my new station and wealth the pressure to take on the obligations that come with being a professional anything and most demanding of all the pressure to win day after day round after round to hold my new position and potentially improve on it
5041349 let him have that monkey on his back for the next 25 30 35 years its not an easy thing
5041350 most of my friends thought i was a lot cooler i guess
5041351 it would kind of just be nice to be a regular person again
5041352 you plow ahead and make a hit and you plow on and someone passes you then someone passes them time levels
5041353 when you think of life as a living active process i dont think its a pleasurable activity unless you have some challenge in that life no matter what it is
5041354 i think in a way that is the philosophy of life
5041355 when im with a group of kids now they just yell out thats the cooking man
5041356 i walk down the streets of san francisco and every kid recognizes me and stops me and says hello you know thats really a wonderful thing
5041357 he knows how great he is but at the same time hes very humble
5041358 hes shocked to see how people still love him and remember him you see his eyes light up and it takes him back a moment when they chant ali ali its like charging a battery up
5041359 it doesnt affect their daily lives the economy is still front and centre stage
5041360 i went to maungakiekie there was a fund raiser there and there were about 300 people
5041361 about 200 of them were pacific islanders that wouldnt have happened in the national party 10 years ago
5041362 for the past two years crude has followed the dollar almost lock step
5041363 the strength weve seen in the dollar is almost certainly helping bring crude down at this point as you move backward it actually acts as a stimulus on the economy
5041364 as for housing starts i think everyone is expecting them to remain soft ppi wont be much of a market mover as commodities have been moving lower which makes last months numbers irrelevant
5041365 when we have new orders thats going to tell you are people ready to put stuff on the shelf
5041366 its important because one of the big drags on the gdp in the second quarter was inventory all about oil
5041367 any geopolitical developments whether it be the iranian situation or further developments with russia and georgia those will influence oil markets
5041368 laura im wondering how if you can make all those sibling suggestions mesh together eg if sylvies sister could be noelle then would sylvie have to be a suggestion for noelle too

5041370 laura im wondering how if you can make all those sibling suggestions mesh together eg if sylvies sister could be noelle then would sylvie have to be a suggestion for noelle too
5041371 the political story simply hasnt developed fully enough to match with historical figures
5041372 i think satan cursed me noooo it has to be god
5041373 sometimes we love people so much that we have to be numb to it because if we actually felt how much we love them it would kill us
5041374 a national fitness nutrition campaign would be great but dont delude yourself that it would convince more than a small minority of people to change their ways
5041375 ronnie loves me and its not about money im looking forward to a fresh start with him its sad weve caused people pain its hurt his family and my family too but weve just fallen in love ronnie is moving on but im not taking someones husband hes leaving i never pursued him

5041382 tutti quanti e tutti iniziano a cantare anke da morti evviva tornato topo gigio
5041383 it has sort of simplified everything and i think we all feel like this is how it was meant to be to some degree
5041384 the three of us have been playing together for so long it just feels right we like the space it leaves in the music
5041385 i had to step up and stop being such a chicken
5041386 more mature with a lot more space a touch melancholic
5041387 weve been here long enough now it would be really hard to leave now emotionally
5041388 i do get homesick every now and then but thats the good thing about coming back and touring

5041413 the goal was to start sectarian violence with the car bombs
5041414 there used to be a whole brigade here and now its less soon these policies will backfire in tal afar and allow terrorists to come in
5041415 we used to depend mostly on coalition forces but unfortunately the footprint of the u s has been reduced
5041416 frankly we dont trust the iraqi police one hundred percent
5041417 when the aug 8 bomb went off in tal afar the police joined with the civilians to attack sunnis when we didnt join the fight they called us terrorists
5041418 as the iraqi units stood up over the past 18 months they took over our bases
5041419 we confirmed that they could operate in company and battalion strength
5041420 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view
5041421 hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me
5041422 im not going to talk about conversations with the campaign
5041423 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the would rally around it
5041424 at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes
5041425 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the

5041463 newsweek how has journalism changed in the years youve been covering the white house thomas the whole transformation into electronic journalism in terms of instantaneousness and brevity and too little faith in reporting on the scene makes me fear the corporate heads have reduced the possibility of seeking the truth i have always known that journalism is a business but has a greater mantra a higher ideal of keeping the american people informed you cant have a democracy without an informed people has access to presidents changed in that time access has diminished greatly access on the part of the press or loss of access sometimes has legitimacy in terms of the security of the powers that be but sometimes limitation of access to the horses mouth can lead to distortion its best to hear what the president says instead of a spokesperson but these days are gone forever years ago we walked down the street throwing questions at presidents kennedy and johnson and that was true access what is the role of the press today or at least what should it be to let the american people know what is being done in their name to undercover unnecessary and unfair secrecy aimed at protecting the manipulators of the truth the role of the press is to seek the truth and thats what should be done what do you think about opinion driven journalism and the rise of fox news and people like bill oreilly they should be clearly identified as personal opinions of talking heads or reporters if they reveal their personal opinions they should say so and not dogmatically slant the facts for their own ends

5041475 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
5041476 but in my view your face is not everything real beauty lies inside a person not outside
5041477 because beauty is all about faces and beautiful girls and skin
5041478 help us bring back a smile to the face of these survivors
5041479 they say that when we come to a beauty salon we come with the expectation that were going to be relaxed in a different frame of mind
5041480 if we come here and we see someone who has gone through so much pain and misery so automatically that gives us that low feeling also they have a point
5041481 at the same time there are clients who take pride in asking these girls to give them a blow dry or getting a manicure or pedicure taken from them
5041482 once we had a wedding in the family i went there and all the girls were getting dressed and putting on makeup so that time i felt a pain in my heart
5041483 but i dont want to weaken myself with these thoughts
5041484 the peace of mind i have now i never had before i suffered much more mental anguish in my married life
5041485 i feel that her hands call me again and again
5041486 when i see them i want to be like them strong girls

5041495 when i crossed the line and saw sherone and kerron there that was the moment

5041497 to my caribbean brothers and sisters congratulations congratulations jamaica the girls were running fast and they shocked the world

5041528 a los ni os se les deben inculcar los h bitos de moderaci n por lo que los padres deben decirle que se quiera mucho y que evite todo lo que le pueda da ar y entre esas cosas est n las drogas

5041531 como corolario personal a mi visita a la exposici n de zaragoza con el eje tem tico de agua y desarrollo sostenible dedicada a este recurso de indudable impacto en las vidas de las personas
5041532 existe una realidad irrefutable en el ser humano su cuerpo est compuesto en un 60 por ciento de agua el cerebro de un 70 por ciento la sangre en un 80 por ciento y los pulmones en un 90 por ciento si se provocara un descenso de tan s lo un 2 de agua en el cuerpo se comenzar a a perder moment neamente la memoria y de forma general se descompensar a el mecanismo de relojer a corporal todo lleva a una reflexi n muy importante el agua nos permite ser inteligentes y la disponibilidad del l quido elemento en el planeta que habitamos es la siguiente hay 1 400 millones de kil metros c bicos de agua de los cuales el 97 por ciento es agua salada del 3 por ciento restante de agua dulce tres cuartas partes corresponden a agua congelada en los polos o a recursos inaccesibles que por lo tanto tampoco se pueden beber eso nos deja a los humanos cerca de un uno por ciento del total de agua en la tierra para usar es decir existe una descompensaci n en la situaci n y disponibilidad del uno por ciento m gico que permite desarrollar la inteligencia todos los d as
5041533 mientras los pobres viven en la tierra dejando una huella ecol gica apenas perceptible soportan el grueso de las consecuencias de la gesti n no sostenible de nuestra interdependencia ecol gica hasta la fecha los habitantes de los pa ses desarrollados se han limitado a ajustar los termostatos soportar veranos m s largos y calurosos y observar cambios en las estaciones para hacer frente al cambio clim tico adem s a medida que aumenta el nivel del mar ciudades como londres y los ngeles pueden enfrentar el riesgo de inundaciones pero sus habitantes est n protegidos por modernos sistemas de defensa por el contrario cuando el calentamiento global altera los patrones clim ticos en el cuerno de frica significa la p rdida de cosechas y hambruna o que las mujeres y las j venes deban dedicar largas horas del d a a buscar agua
5041534 hay que pensar fr amente que algo hay que hacer en relaci n con este fen meno silente en el que la inteligencia humana sufre sus consecuencias creo que a partir de la lectura de los datos facilitados por el documento citado puede ayudarnos saber que el agua tiene m s valor que precio y la inteligencia digital puede hacer un hueco para abordar este problema si estamos de acuerdo en construir juntos una definici n sobre la que estoy trabajando ltimamente capacidad y habilidad de las personas para resolver problemas utilizando los sistemas y tecnolog as de la informaci n y comunicaci n cuando est n al servicio de la ciudadan a es decir cuando han superado la dial ctica infernal del doble uso
5041535 yesterday they killed 50 persons here if i were not here who would help them endure except heaven this is the only place i would like to be
5041536 because i know what it meant at that time to help a jew
5041537 how beautiful to hold an icon together of a person who brought unity

5041553 weve asked our allies to provide any of the escort requirements for our chinooks and or possibly the charters in theatre
5041554 so that capability that the griffon might fulfill should be addressed by nato
5041555 im appalled that the government is not moving ahead on its own attack helicopters that would ensure we can move independently as a nation and bring our chinooks into hotspots and difficult landing areas
5041556 to me its fundamental that if were going to have half the capability which is the chinook then we should get the other half of the capability which is an attack helicopter
5041557 youve seen the ramp ceremonies for one or two soldiers can you imagine what a ramp ceremony for 35 people would be like

5041577 no no recomendar a vuestra sociedad como un ideal para la transformaci n de la nuestra
5041578 hemos puesto demasiadas esperanzas en la pol tica y en las reformas sociales s lo para descubrir que terminamos despojados de nuestra posesi n m s preciada nuestra vida espiritual que est siendo pisoteada por la jaur a partidaria en el este y por la jaur a comercial en occidente esta es la esencia de la crisis la escisi n del mundo es menos aterradora que la similitud de la enfermedad que ataca a sus miembros principales
5041579 desde el momento en que su cuerpo est condenado a muerte su misi n sobre la tierra evidentemente debe ser m s espiritual y no s lo disfrutar incontrolablemente de la vida diaria no la b squeda de las mejores formas de obtener bienes materiales y su despreocupado consumo tiene que ser el cumplimiento de un serio y permanente deber de modo tal que el paso de uno por la vida se convierta por sobre todo en una experiencia de crecimiento moral para dejar la vida siendo un ser humano mejor que el que entr en ella
5041580 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to

5041583 to show that we support the georgian people and also the government to deal with the work there is to do
5041584 the security zone is temporary this is not disputed by any of the parties
5041585 it is more important that foreign observers arrive so it is not only troops of the commonwealth of independent states cis
5041586 there is no such notion any more in georgia as russian peacekeepers there can be no russian peacekeepers these are just russian forces

5041595 im not going to talk about conversations with the campaign
5041596 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it
5041597 at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes
5041598 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states
5041599 i think its the responsibility of the vice president if youre unwilling or unable to do that then i think you should defer to someone else

5041614 senator mccain has said that we need to deal with this aggressively
5041615 and one of the questions this crisis raises is who do you want sitting across the table from vladimir putin and people like him john mccain or senator obama i think the answer is senator mccain and thats for obvious reasons
5041616 whether to go into iraq or not barack obama was correct how to get out of iraq the iraqis embraced barack obamas position even george bush is coming around
5041617 he was right about afghanistan john mccain is coming around on that
5041618 it has been concluded that the safest way is for the mothers to feed their babies on nothing but breast milk for the first six months while they the mothers are on arvs

5041630 yo soy de la idea de que un secuestro debe combatirse con las mismas armas con la que ellos act an me parece que el estado mexicano tendr que ser muy s lido y si hay que enfrentarse con ellos y si hay que terminar con ellos independientemente de c mo sea esto habr que hacerlo

5041638 se debe impulsar infraestructura industrial porque no basta con hacer gestiones para hacer inversiones hay que ser competitivos para ganar las inversiones y segundo se requiere infraestructura agroindustrial

5041716 lamore la delusione pi grande alle volte per fortuna cerco di prevederle le storie dolorose anche se siamo di carne ed ossa mi fai troppo ridere quando simuli il ruolo di valoroso cavaliere pronto a sguainare la spada e combattere contro le avversit di questo inesorabile tempo
5041717 its as if weve changed from am radio to fm radio and the improved fidelity means we can put more information into the same bandwidth

5041726 only by a genuine personal decision for christ and the church can someone separate himself from it
5041727 the thin end of the wedge soft drugs yoga for relaxation horoscopes just for fun and so on is more dangerous than the thick end because it is more deceptive an evil spirit tries to make his entry as unobtrusively as possible
5041728 beware of any claim to mediate beneficial energies eg reiki any courses that promise the peace that christ promises eg enneagrams any alternative therapy with its roots in eastern religion e g acupuncture

5041810 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5041811 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5041812 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5041869 weve asked our allies to provide any of the escort requirements for our chinooks and or possibly the charters in theatre
5041870 so that capability that the griffon might fulfill should be addressed by nato
5041871 im appalled that the government is not moving ahead on its own attack helicopters that would ensure we can move independently as a nation and bring our chinooks into hotspots and difficult landing areas
5041872 to me its fundamental that if were going to have half the capability which is the chinook then we should get the other half of the capability which is an attack helicopter

5041889 on may 12 the day when the earthquake hit sichuan chengdu felt the quake most of the enterprises stopped working that day and the next to evaluate losses caused by the quake and ensure the safety of the personnel on may 13 15 most of the enterprises resumed production
5041890 at that time vendors from u s japan and taiwan reacted calmly as earthquakes have occurred in those countries during the quake there was no destruction to the electricity water and gas facilities in the zone but the earthquake affected us mainly in the fact that negotiations of some investment projects were halted pending evaluation of the impact of the earthquake
5041891 to our knowledge none of intels equipment was damaged intel promptly restored production soon after the experts came from the united states to assess the buildings and equipment and confirmed that there was no damage two units of precision equipment from huawei symantec were damaged due to unstable installation but the problem was promptly solved chengdu city does not change its principle that construction projects should be built to withstand six earthquakes because chengdu is not located on the earthquake belt if the anti quake protection is to be upgraded to an additional level the total construction cost will increase by 10 percent but up to the end of 2009 there will be relevant favorable policies such as reducing the cost of construction registration
5041892 we organized a team of experts to investigate the constructions in the zone immediately after the quake no problems were reported concerning the main frame of the constructions the endangered buildings that are to be dismantled did not fall due to the quake either
5041893 smic has hundreds of assembly and testing equipment in our fab some were displaced in the earthquake but did not get damaged the day after the quake we resumed production and 70 80 percent of the employees returned to normal working schedules a week afterwards 100 percent of production capacity was restored
5041894 within a few days our production was restored and we began to arrange our delivery as before afterwards our factory operation was not at all affected we also helped affected staff to apply for relief funds and they are now very emotionally stable
5041895 recently our chairman craig barrett visited chengdu to attest that our investment in chengdu will not change
5041896 for two or three days we did not work in the office we used flexible management the earthquake caused parts of the ceilings to fall off and had an impact on the r amp d process but on the whole the buildings in the zone were safe
5041897 the greater impact is on the employees psychological well being as 99 percent of our staff had never experienced an earthquake before
5041898 after the quake hq reduced workload but at present none of the employees have used the earthquake as an excuse to delay work
5041899 the working process is on the right track now there are no problems as long as there are no problems with the people
5041900 there are 15 large scale manufacturing enterprises in the west park with over 7 000 employees there were no deaths or injuries as a consequence of the earthquake and by may 13 most of the enterprises had restored production
5041901 the precision equipment are generally built to withstand earthquakes so there was no damage reported from the current perspective the production capacity in may was lower than before but by june it had completely recovered since the enterprises in the area are mostly export oriented there was no influence on the orders on the contrary there was an increase
5041902 we had some difficulty right after the quake especially with flight transportation capacity many enterprises send their products to hong kong and other places mainly by air transport but the earthquake caused a significant decrease in the number of people traveling between chengdu and hong kong thus causing a corresponding decrease in flights
5041903 we took the initiative immediately after the earthquake to apply for government subsidies for direct cargo flights between chengdu and hong kong as early as the beginning of july
5041904 we have already filed an application with the state department and hope to achieve this target around september
5041905 the comprehensive free trade zone is a major step of cdht in the future
5041906 the earthquake had some negative effects on cdht and chengdu has been financially affected some enterprises slowed down their pace
5041907 by adopting every effective measure possible we have quickly restored production capacity in the zone to 100 percent which greatly boosts the confidence of investors our investors policies do not change because chengdu does not change and the geological structure is also stable
5041908 its difficult to really get that adrenaline going in the bullpen as opposed to getting out there so you just do everything possible that you can to stay in a rhythm

5041911 i want to give jorge every opportunity to show me this is something he can handle
5041912 i think jorge has age on his side theres a more dynamic arm
5041913 thats not to take anything away from glendons efficiency but right now i think we need to make sure we are creative and proactive looking at this
5041914 i think its a good fit for him and hes growing up
5041915 i think a vote of confidence right about now may be something that can help him
5041916 what we do want to do is if we put a guy on the dl have him have a chance to come back and pitch with health not pitch once and go backward
5041917 we can manipulate the rotation a little bit if somebody needs to rest and we dont know that yet
5041918 weve told wakefield how we feel and if hes healthy we can figure it out so well just try to use good judgment

5041960 ich hatte einen guten start ins rennen bin aber nach wenigen runden auf p6 zur ckgefallen ich habe mir sorgen gemacht dass ich nicht zur ckschlagen k nnte weil ich hier doch nicht sonderlich lange im trockenen unterwegs gewesen bin
5041961 meine zuversicht wuchs aber mit der zeit und ich konnte zu john aufschlie en und ihn gegen rennh lfte passieren gegen rennende ist das gripniveau dramatisch abgefallen sodass ich gegen shinya nakano anm d red nichts ausrichten konnte au er bis zur zielflagge konstant meine runden zu ziehen
5041962 ich f hlte mich auf dem bike deutlich wohler als zuvor und die bridgestone reifen hatten definitiv einen vorteil gegen ber anderen fahrern
5041963 ich musste heute richtig hart fahren habe bis zur rennh lfte nicht einmal auf meine boxentafel geschaut wir haben also noch einiges an arbeit vor uns denn wir mussten wirklich sehr pushen um schnell genug aus den kurven herauszukommen das hat sich gl cklicherweise ausgezahlt und p5 ist mein bislang bestes ergebnis in der motogp ich bin also sehr zufrieden
5041964 anthony hat mich erstaunt denn ich habe keineswegs von ihm erwartet dass er im trockenen ein so tolles resultat einf hrt er ist das ganze rennen ber fantastisch gefahren
5041965 es tut mir leid f r john denn er war zu beginn des rennens stark unterwegs aber wir konnten leider nichts f r ihn tun als der grip nachlie wir haben jetzt zwei testtage wo john wichtige zeit auf der strecke verbringen und das nachholen kann was er in den vergangenen wochen verpasst hat
5041966 es ist sicherlich entt uschend das rennen auf p11 zu beenden vor allem nachdem ich mich so zuversichtlich und stark gef hlt hatte
5041967 wir haben bei der reifenwahl gezockt und haben einen anderen hinterreifen genommen als alle anderen leider lie der reifen zum schluss nach und die linke seite hatte fast gar keinen grip mehr
5041968 f r gew hnlich kann ich so etwas kaschieren aber mit meiner knieverletzung ging das nicht das gute war aber dass wir stark waren solange der reifen funktioniert hat
5041969 ich freue mich nun schon auf die kommenden testtage wobei ich all die kilometer aufholen m chte die mir durch meine verletzung durch die lappen gegangen sind ich will das bike weiterentwickeln und eine l sung f r meine heutigen probleme finden

5041992 markus showed signs of what he is capable of in pre season he is definitely right at the front in the pecking order but that is something that can change from week to week now we are going to have more competition for places up front and in my experience that is something that is always good for the team

5041999 you know you can do all of the right things and still come up wrong
5042000 by the way i saw your book on the internet how much did you tell me your book was selling for
5042001 youre kidding where in europe asia are we talking united states dollars
5042002 im at my computer now and i just pulled up your book on my screen and somebody is selling it for 74 13
5042003 who who is selling my book for 74 13 and where
5042004 its being auctioned check it out for yourself im looking at it now the book has your title on it your name the name of the publisher theres no mistake this your book check it out and get back to me
5042005 okay ill check it out ill get back to you thanks
5042006 ms sears i am afraid that there is nothing we can do about this
5042007 why not someone is selling or attempting to sell my book which your company published for 74 13 which is two and one half times the original sales price thats 74 13 in profits that is not going to the pockets of your publishing company not to mention the royalties that i am not getting paid for the 74 13 sale thats money that should be in both of our pockets how did that happen the book is copyrighted and a portion of the title is trademarked and this sale or auction of my book is being done without my consent and without consultation with me
5042008 im sorry i have discussed this situation with my colleagues here and there is nothing we can do here is what happened apparently someone bought your book an individual purchased your book and then after reading it decided to auction it or resell it on the website that you told us about to used booksellers that we do not have a relationship with nor can we tell them how to operate you received a royalty payment when the individual who is reselling your book now first purchased your book and we received the proceeds of that sale we cannot receive any proceeds from the resale of your book nor are you entitled to any royalties as a result of this resale i am sorry ms sears
5042009 so what youre telling me is that in order to protect my intellectual property ownership rights in my next book that the next time around i write a book so that my next book does not get auctioned off or resold i will need to have a clause written into my publishing contract which states that the book shall not be resold or auctioned by third party resellers without the authors or publishers written permission and that in the event of a resale or auction of the book the publisher is entitled to receive from the third party reseller the proceeds from the resale or auction and the author is entitled to receive from the third party reseller the royalties from the resale or auction of the book is that right
5042010 ms sears a publishing contract like that does not exist and no publisher would ever agree to publish your book with a clause like that in your publishing contract i am sorry but there is nothing we can do and there has been no breach or infringement of the copyrights law i will send you an e mail which explains everything okay
5042011 i see please send me an e mail which puts your explanation in writing and send me the paragraph or paragraphs of the united states copyright law which you state that you have in your possession which in your words says that the fact that a copyright infringement has not occurred as a result of the resale and auction of my book thank you for your time
5042012 dear ms diane sears good day i hope all is well i received an email regarding your concern about your book being auctioned by an individual without your consent the 74 13 book that is being auctioned on www xxxxxx com is from a third party seller what happened was when customers decided to sell their copy of the book to book resellers like www xxxxxx com xxxxxxxandxxxxxx com we do not have a relationship with these used book resellers nor do we have a say in the way they operate their business since they got these books from the customers who decided to sell their purchased books to them these used book resellers are entitled to sell used book under the first sale doctrine of copyright law which reads as follows 17 u s c 109 a limitations on exclusive rights effect of transfer of particular copy or phonorecord a notwithstanding the provisions of section 106 3 the owner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title or any person authorized by such owner is entitled without the authority of the copyright owner to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or phonorecord as with all sales you receive royalties on each printing of your book any copy obtained by these resellers and offered for sale with a lesser or higher price has been originally obtained from either xxxxxxxx distribution xxxxxx and xxxxx or xxxxxx directly with the royalties credited to you therefore no sale is being made outside of the proper channels or against your rights to your work i hope i was able to address your concern should you still have other questions please let me know jane doe post publication representative

5042078 if we come here and we see someone who has gone through so much pain and misery so automatically that gives us that low feeling also they have a point
5042079 at the same time there are clients who take pride in asking these girls to give them a blow dry or getting a manicure or pedicure taken from them

5042093 with the fall in oil and other commodity prices in the past month both the markets and fed officials had started to turn away from inflation risks and focus on growth risks
5042094 the view which we agree with is that with the usual long and variable lags falling commodity prices and rising unemployment will drive down inflation no need for the fed to get its hands dirty when the housing and credit crunch will do the job

5042150 i am just wondering is it okay if i play my piano for you
5042151 das ist ein harter schlag f r uns weil er ein absoluter leistungstr ger ist
5042152 viele mannschaften sind gerade zu saisonbeginn sehr motiviert da passieren solche dinge aber wir haben ja gute schiedsrichter in deutschland die das entsprechend ahnden werden
5042153 das war einfach nur dummheit die drei punkte h tten wir mitnehmen m ssen

5042156 the process is probably the most valuable thing the way that making a work with people changes you and changes the people probably has more importance than the actual objects left behind
5042157 ich denke ich habe mich ein bisschen bewegt am start und ich dachte sie w rden ihn abbrechen ich meine ich habe einen fehlstart verursacht
5042158 ich denke es gab einen fehlstart ich habe auf den r ckruf gewartet aber gut das rennen ist vor ber man muss es abhaken
5042159 weve asked our allies to provide any of the escort requirements for our chinooks and or possibly the charters in theatre
5042160 so that capability that the griffon might fulfill should be addressed by nato
5042161 im appalled that the government is not moving ahead on its own attack helicopters that would ensure we can move independently as a nation and bring our chinooks into hotspots and difficult landing areas
5042162 to me its fundamental that if were going to have half the capability which is the chinook then we should get the other half of the capability which is an attack helicopter
5042163 youve seen the ramp ceremonies for one or two soldiers can you imagine what a ramp ceremony for 35 people would be like
5042164 the hardest thing at the olympics in the high jump is just getting to the finals once youre in the finals youre carefree you dont have to worry about anything
5042165 my clearance at 7 4 1 2 wasnt that great i knew i needed to give a lot more at 7 6 i definitely put forth the effort it just wasnt good enough
5042166 there has been just so much support from my family and friends especially back in raleigh
5042167 itll be hard to go home and face everyone i let myself down i know i didnt let all of them down because i made it to beijing but i really expected to do a lot better you put so much effort in one meet so when you dont do well it really hurts it sucks
5042168 yeah my coach will make me ready but i was ready today thats the thing
5042169 im in great shape probably the best of my life i could have gotten a personal best

5042176 various major daily newspaper published on july 10 a photograph of four iranian missiles streaking heavenward then little green footballs significantly a blog and not a daily newspaper provided evidence that the photograph had been faked later many of those same papers published a whitmans sampler of retractions and apologies for me it raised a series of questions about images 1 do they provide illustration of a text or an idea of evidence of some underlying reality or both and if they are evidence dont we have to know that the evidence is reliable that it can be trusted

5042184 for his last three college semesters the reds will contribute 78 000 thats 60 000 in tuition and 18 000 in books and board
5042185 a trip for his immediate family will be paid for by the reds for his first major league game
5042186 gets 25 000 if he is rookie of the year 100 if he is mvp and 100 000 if he is mvp of the world series for what team
5042187 bottom line by placing that waiver claim this week the twins were willing to take on washburns entire contract 13 million through the end of 2009 for a 34 year old lefty who is 5 12 with a 4 58 era and the ms walked away from the chance
5042188 i almost feel bad for the mariners fans when you fire a guy like bavasi you expect that the only direction you can go is up turns out we were mistaken
5042189 do they possibly have the biggest busy body ownership just somehow escaping the negative publicity about it since they previously had such a perfect scapegoat in one of the worst gm you could find
5042190 this is a team that has a serious lack of young pitching and a good young catcher and with the 10th pick they chose a catcher
5042191 jarrod saltalamacchia would be a nice fit in boston next season
5042192 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view
5042193 hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me
5042194 im not going to talk about conversations with the campaign
5042195 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it
5042196 at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes
5042197 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states
5042198 i think its the responsibility of the vice president if youre unwilling or unable to do that then i think you should defer to someone else
5042199 i dont want to be vice president im not going to be the nominee
5042200 mass effect amp ff6a meaningful ways to pass the time
5042201 defensively were miles ahead of where we were at the start of the year
5042202 thats come through hard work and a great attitude from the players and i guess tonight really showed that and won us the game
5042203 too many mistakes fundamental mistakes passing out of dummy half dropped balls on collision bad passing just a really very poor game skill wise
5042204 i havent seen you in a long time werent you killed off the last time
5042205 and this is a blog story thats made up on the spot who really cares about continuity dont you recall i like my friends to call me lola
5042206 will you stop coming up with slang terms for money in the narration
5042207 and quit trying to fill out this story its a missing person case
5042208 big movies the latest one was supposed to be out this fall but now hes missing and might not be seen until july
5042209 that harry potter so you want me to find this punk and what do i do when i find him want his legs broken cause that costs extra
5042210 people are worried that his next picture is going to suck harder than an electrified sucking machine and we need to hear the truth
5042211 hes been hanging out with the warner brothers since he got into movies
5042212 i want to talk to the warner brothers and im going to talk to the warner brothers
5042213 but i aint your momma and i must warn you that i know judo
5042214 i gotta a lot of work to do on the sequel to the golden compass
5042215 i need to talk to some folks about harry potter
5042216 i thought he went missing because he was flashing his weeny in that play on broadway
5042217 and what happens in new york stays in new york
5042218 besides if anyone really cared and wanted to stop him all they had to do was go to the dress rehearsal and yell ive seen more meat on a dirty fork
5042219 unlike us the kids who watch harry potter only really care about the stories and dont really care too much about the actors unless theyre somehow unable to do their job or obnoxious adults shove it in their faces
5042220 well at least im the thinnest man in the room
5042221 hand over the kid before i break out the shop vac and start doing some home liposuction
5042222 a perfectly running corporate machine you see we made a lot of money off of the dark knight
5042223 and we figured that having harry potter open in the fall would be too much too soon
5042224 so we bumped him back to july of next year
5042225 folks are now speculating that the movies going to suck
5042226 or that youre angry over the actor appearing equus and that itll somehow change the film into a nudity fest and your own magazines arent cluing into the plan in time to change their cover stories
5042227 weve got a movie called twilight taking over the tentpole position this fall it should do great
5042228 theres an army of eager kids and geeky adults waiting to see you
5042229 we dont want it to get in the way of running the business
5042230 if we started giving quarterly guidance all of a sudden the whole company would start focusing on the quarter rather than trying to change the world
5042231 well of course google has so much money they can afford not to focus on the money
5042232 google looked a lot like a charity in the beginning they didnt have ads for over a year at year 1 google was indistinguishable from a nonprofit if a nonprofit or government organization had started a project to index the web google at year 1 is the limit of what theyd have produced

5042236 it looks like valeri has snapped his achilles and will be out for six months it is a huge blow for the lad
5042237 we are all desperately disappointed for him this has come on top of being out for a year already so it is a huge blow for him
5042238 it was also not an ideal way for us to start this game
5042239 in fairness i was pleased with the first half performance we had to combat the physical presence the pace and effectiveness of set plays that villa have
5042240 we were in the game at 1 1 but then had an eight minute spell when we conceded the type of goals that we are not happy with from our point of view
5042241 you could see the confidence go flooding into gabby once he had scored that first goal the other two goals were magnificent and i was delighted for him
5042242 in terms of england his time will come it is a long season and he knows what is ahead this is a great start for him
5042243 i was a bit surprised ashley did not get in the england squad but his time will come as well i have no doubts whatsoever that they will make it through
5042244 we had the better of the first half but had a couple of chances we did not take
5042245 i felt at half time we just needed more of the same but we had to be careful because in possession city were very good
5042246 im not gonna teach your boyfriend how to dance with you the twelves remix
5042247 you can make these up to one week in advance
5042248 reckless people have deluded themselves that this was a subprime crisis
5042249 but we have problems with credit card debt student loan debt auto loans commercial real estate loans home equity loans corporate debt and loans that financed leveraged buyouts
5042250 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
5042251 ah da capo ii this is one anime that does not stray from the standard harem drama archetype fortunately the studio didnt dare be too pretentious with the style of direction which spares it some points ive never played the game it was based on but if it was anything worthwhile then what we have here is an excellent example of a failed game to anime transition because the producers were unable to properly dramatise a potentially fruitful plot either because of the sub par voice acting awful soundtrack generally unoriginal characters save for a few of the heroines plus sakura hope to see more of them next season or just the general direction in which the plot was headed drama is unequivocally made to move the hearts of others and if it fails to accomplish that then its purpose is defeated if theres something that saved it from even harsher criticism itd be the ending which although anti climatic and bordering on the edge of mediocrity proved to be decent in relativity to the rest of the series with season two on its way in april i really do hope that it can salvage the remains of this season and put it to good use the content covered so far has proven to be unimpressive at best
5042252 because you have to finish what you start duty my friend duty viewers have been unanimously faced with a failure of a drama that does not even come close to meeting the threshold for emotional impact and now the producers are forced to walk the path of redemption hope that they succeed but dont hold your breath and most importantly dont expect anything
5042253 what is it its the new camaro thats what it is
5042254 the new camaro well it accelerates like its being chased by the hounds of hell hey i can relate but enough about my love life
5042255 its a whole new kind of car for a whole new kind of people who really dig driving
5042256 its not how young you are its how old you arent
5042257 whether its your newborns more hardened appearance the way he now approaches people with guarded skepticism or just that look on his face that says oh wait maybe life isnt all hugs and kisses and rainbows
5042258 geez dont you think he deserves a little payback this tart is ready to go
5042259 theres a combination of reality and voyeurism that captures the imagination
5042260 if katie was this entertaining when she was actually on the air i might even watch her little newscast
5042261 its nice to be on youtube when i know the cameras are rolling harry shearer im gonna get you
5042262 but in my view your face is not everything real beauty lies inside a person not outside
5042263 because beauty is all about faces and beautiful girls and skin
5042264 help us bring back a smile to the face of these survivors
5042265 they say that when we come to a beauty salon we come with the expectation that were going to be relaxed in a different frame of mind
5042266 if we come here and we see someone who has gone through so much pain and misery so automatically that gives us that low feeling also they have a point
5042267 at the same time there are clients who take pride in asking these girls to give them a blow dry or getting a manicure or pedicure taken from them
5042268 once we had a wedding in the family i went there and all the girls were getting dressed and putting on makeup so that time i felt a pain in my heart
5042269 but i dont want to weaken myself with these thoughts
5042270 the peace of mind i have now i never had before i suffered much more mental anguish in my married life
5042271 i feel that her hands call me again and again
5042272 when i see them i want to be like them strong girls
5042273 i want to make a name for myself in this profession
5042274 im independent now i stand on my own two feet
5042275 i have a job i work i earn in fact im living on my own which isnt an easy thing to do for a woman in pakistan for a lone woman to survive
5042276 and hed be like man the pizza is good today
5042277 i just wanted to make sure i took every single moment in and every single swim in every single moment with my teammates so i would remember them
5042278 to swim in the same era as him has been awesome
5042279 weve been talking about mark spitz for 36 years now
5042280 i dont know if im going to be alive when they stop talking about this bloke you wonder if we are going to see someone as good as this again
5042281 being able to have something like that to shoot for it made those days when i was tired and i didnt want to be there
5042282 im just thankful for him having done what he did
5042283 the sport of swimming has come a long way so far and i think it can go even further
5042284 mike is opening a lot of doors with what hes doing
5042285 i just want to lay in my own bed for five minutes at least and just relax
5042286 one of the things im really looking forward to is getting back to baltimore
5042287 hes more naturally suited for longer distances itll be change for him but i think itll be a good one
5042288 when we train every day sometimes there are workouts you dont like dont want to do bob says youre putting money in the bank
5042289 i guess i put a lot of money in the bank over the last four years and we withdrew pretty much every penny in the bank after bob and i both grab a little break itll be time to start depositing

5042297 new labour has accomplished more permanent diminution of human civil liberties than ww2 bombs and rockets ever achieved
5042298 new labours disregard for human civil rights is now a general contagion with each infliction coated in a syrup of entirely cosmetic safeguards for swallowing
5042299 i am following with attention and concern the situation in georgia and i feel particularly close to the victims of the conflict
5042300 while i raise a special prayer for the dead i express my sincere condolences to all those who mourn and i ask that the severe hardships of refugees especially those of women and children who might have difficulty in obtaining necessities be relieved with generosity
5042301 the still abandoned dead can receive dignified burial and the wounded can be properly cared for and allowed to reunite with their loved ones
5042302 i dont think theres any question its a function of sponsor involvement and the sponsor involvement has a great deal to do with the economy
5042303 a company has to be 100 percent committed to motorsports in this kind of economy to be able to spend the money that it takes which goes back to part of the reason that i believe its not in our best interest to have 48 49 teams
5042304 now the top 35 rule is a tremendous step in the right direction its way better than it used to be
5042305 what dreadful hot weather we have it keeps me in a continual state of inelegance
5042306 in august the large masses of berries which when in flower had attracted many wild bees gradually assumed their bright velvety crimson hue and by their weight again bent down and broke their tender limbs
5042307 a racist a colonialist an alcoholic a bad parent a reactionary militaristic a megalomaniac a shameless self promoter and self advertiser these are just some of the criticisms that have been leveled at winston churchill throughout history
5042308 we do expect rainfall by the end the week from this
5042309 i was anticipating a very hard battle if i did catch him
5042310 so when i saw the red bike slide out i could hardly believe it this made things a lot easier for me
5042311 of course i cant count this as a complete victory because casey fell and i am sorry for him
5042312 but this is racing and i have to be happy with this result we are 50 points clear which is a lot and i am very excited to be going to misano in this situation
5042313 the crash came out of the blue that corner was an easy one but i lost the front and it happened very quickly very suddenly and i didnt manage to save it
5042314 its a hard one to explain and we will look at the data but sometimes this kind of crash happens at this level of racing and it was my mistake
5042315 anything can happen in racing but fifty points is a big gap against such a strong and consistent competitor anyway i never throw in the towel nor does anybody at ducati and we will keep fighting until the end
5042316 i want to say what a fantastic day this is for me today after the injury in barcelona i have not had the opportunity to go quick due to my condition
5042317 but all the people around me including the whole team and suzuki stayed really close to me and gave me great support so i am really happy to pay them back with this podium it actually feels more like a win for me because it means so much
5042318 without god and the future life how will man be after that it means everything is permitted now

5042329 this work demonstrates that we can get a complete genome for a totally unknown organism
5042330 we extracted a complete genome from a very complex community and this is something novel
5042331 you can only use amplification when you know what youre trying to get and thats the problem
5042332 when you want to discover something unknown amplification is a very deficient technique because you keep discovering the things you already know so how can you discover the unknown

5042335 we can convert the spin information into a current and manipulate it and change it
5042336 we are manipulating this information and reading it out again we are writing it and reading it
5042337 even the smallest transistor today consists of hundreds of thousands of atoms
5042338 the ultimate goal of miniaturization is to implement electronics on the scale of atoms and electrons
5042339 just like a mass on a spring the pulse produces an oscillation of the spins of singlets and triplets in the organic led
5042340 i won an olympic gold for the second time i prepared very well and its easy to run all my dreams came true im so happy for myself and my country
5042341 i did well in the first 300 meters and stayed relaxed from there
5042342 the final is going to be tough christine ohuruogu great britain looked great in the first round
5042343 i was so calm and relaxed in the warm ups
5042344 i was feeling great i knew i was going to go through to the final sadly i did not i will be disappointed not to make the final i let people down if i let them down it means i didnt do my best
5042345 ive been wearing my shoes longer than him every day i look at my gold shoes and say you cant be wearing gold shoes and not be winning
5042346 its the first gold medal for slovenia in the track and field events
5042347 this is my dream come true you cant go out and say you will win a medal you must make it happen
5042348 everything i saw was so lovely that my eyes could not weary beholding such beauty
5042349 its incredible the lord has blessed us with antibodies our whole lifetime
5042350 the appraiser said the house was worth 114 500 so why would we sell it for 100 000
5042351 i called regularly to ask for updates but most of the time they never returned my calls finally i just gave up
5042352 the mere fact that a number of complaints have been filed against a person doesnt mean that all of the complaints reach the level of where there needs to be disciplinary action taken
5042353 we were taken advantage of and there was no one there to protect us
5042354 teacher what good deed must i do to gain eternal life
5042355 why do you ask me about what is good there is only one who is good if you would enter life keep the commandments
5042356 you shall not kill you shall not commit adultery you shall not steal you shall not bear false witness honor your father and mother and you shall love your neighbor as yourself
5042357 all of these i have observed what do i still lack
5042358 if you would be perfect go sell what you possess and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven and come follow me
5042359 go sell what you possess and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven and come follow me
5042360 everyone who does not renounce all his possessions cannot be my disciple
5042361 you got to take care of this to move on
5042362 you cant look at this game and think we played well and were going to move on its about what we do in two days
5042363 they hit a lot of 3s and love to drive and kickout for the open shot
5042364 i just happen to be in the right place at the right time
5042365 i actually thought that i missed a lot of shots early that i usually hit
5042366 i think most of us grew up watching these girls i think i was 10 years old when lisa leslie played in her first olympics it was a good experience i think we played pretty well all things considered
5042367 i had a little bit of hope inside of me
5042368 but seeing how beautifully she executed her routine i knew
5042369 after the all around i was excited to have made the floor finals and a bronze medal feels great
5042370 today i concentrated only on my moves not the medals
5042371 i felt that i had a very normal performance without surprises and that is why i got a silver medal
5042372 im disappointed especially since third place had a fall and i made both of mine
5042373 i cant change her score the judges made up their minds
5042374 i definitely had to pull myself together a little bit the last few days
5042375 im sure someday ill appreciate what i did i still have to get to that step
5042376 it is amazing to go to three olympics and get three medals
5042377 i was nervous when i was watching the other gymnasts competing after me
5042378 this is a competition so two or three mistakes are pretty common i was struggling during those 10 minutes i was worried that i wouldnt get the gold medal
5042379 i can t allow that one person to sour me on humanity
5042380 winning a medal at the olympic games is one of the hardest things you can do there are a lot of people in this world and youve got to give respect to our athletes who are doing their best out here
5042381 its hard to beat the canadian team up too much
5042382 theyre not converting to medals but theyre certainly not swimming badly
5042383 in athens we were bystanders watching a great swim meet
5042384 this time its an even better swim meet and we have people in the finals
5042385 everybodys racing everybodys competing were having a great meet and were showing that we belong on this stage

5042398 but shes not known as a daredevil shes actually conservative and likes to learn new skills methodically she does her best when she feels confident with the level of difficulty shes competing
5042399 i remember in sydney at first i just had no clue i was mesmerized by the opening ceremonies i was just sort of floating around on cloud nine that whole time
5042400 i was only 19 then and im almost 28 now so a lot has changed
5042401 i feel like i matured a whole bunch even between sydney and athens
5042402 before i never had a huge obstacle like this ive learned you know its never a shoo in to compete in your third olympics
5042403 at the 1998 world championships china sent about 20 coaches to watch and film everything
5042404 they hired more than two dozen russian coaches to train their coaches and set up national training centres
5042405 it was her first final in a competition shes really come on strong in the individual event

5042429 the word of the russian president needs to be upheld by his forces people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted i think its really very much time for them to do what they said they were going to do
5042430 territorial integrity of georgia must be respected that abkhazia and south ossetia are within the internationally recognized boundaries of georgia
5042431 i went to georgia to stongly support the democratically elected governemt of georgia to demonstrate that the russian strategic intent of destroying the foundation of democracy in georgia the russian strategic intent of destroying georgian infrastructure and economic progress that that would not succeed

5042436 records fall and then they fall again but never in recent history has a 100 meter record fallen like it fell on saturday night in china
5042437 i thought i could finish the race but it cinched up on my first stride
5042438 i could barely even get on my toes i was limping from the start
5042439 there were no uighurs no zhuangs no huis no tujias no mongols and definitely no tibetans
5042440 holy sh t can you believe we used to be like that
5042441 it is a fairy tale that the u s defense shield missiles would be aimed at pariah states
5042442 i think its very loose rhetoric and i think its unnecessary and frankly its empty rhetoric
5042443 the russians arent going to launch nuclear missiles at anybody because 10 defensive missile interceptors are located in poland so i think some of the leadership of russia needs to get a better handle on the leadership of some of the folks there
5042444 we just want those in russia who seem to be willing to look to the future people perhaps like president medvedev to perhaps begin to exercise more influence here and get some of these peoples rhetoric under control
5042445 i think what we try to teach the young guys is dont get caught up into it
5042446 going into the playoffs theres a lot more pressure with the media the fans things can get pretty blown out of proportion if you dont watch out thats when you have to really stay levelheaded and not get caught up into it
5042447 the intensity might be a little higher of course because your adrenaline is going but other than that really the game itself is no different
5042448 in baseball you have to be intense but you also have to be relaxed because if youre facing a top notch pitcher youre very seldomly going to do well if youre intense
5042449 you have to know how to control your emotions and control your tensions and its hard sometimes
5042450 its a learned behavior and the only way to learn it is if you play
5042451 we look to our veteran players for that guys who can teach us just through talking to them
5042452 weve been in some pretty big games already this year and were in the pennant race and i think if anybody is going to compare us with how well play in the playoffs its playing right now
5042453 for some of the younger guys like myself i think thats where were going to get our experience before we get to the playoffs
5042454 the weather has been cool weve got a day off tomorrow and were going to be off a lot i asked him on saturday and he said he was good to go i said im ready to rest you and he said he was good to go this is an important game
5042455 if things were different if we were playing on monday or if we just had one day off and another string of games if the weather was different but we really caught a break
5042456 no one in here cares about draft picks because the fastest guy will be here in three or four years
5042457 the fact of the matter is that if we sign our no 1 pick hes going to be the highest paid player on our team so the draft is completely out of control
5042458 its just another testament to the commitment that we have to make this a very sustainable organization a very competitive organization
5042459 we still have a lot of work to do were doing the things that we set out to do
5042460 getting these guys signed especially pedro we feel like weve got some very good players in this draft were very excited about them weve added a lot of depth weve added some very quality players as well its another step in the process
5042461 you got to take care of this to move on
5042462 you cant look at this game and think we played well and were going to move on its about what we do in two days
5042463 they hit a lot of 3s and love to drive and kickout for the open shot
5042464 i just happen to be in the right place at the right time
5042465 i actually thought that i missed a lot of shots early that i usually hit
5042466 i think most of us grew up watching these girls i think i was 10 years old when lisa leslie played in her first olympics it was a good experience i think we played pretty well all things considered
5042467 i was so obsessed with me and the reasons i might be dissatisfied that i couldnt focus on other people
5042468 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
5042469 not only were there political consequences but saddam hussein was a bad person and there was no question he meant america ill
5042470 the interrogator said go back to your cell and its going to be very tough on you now
5042471 it took a lot of prayer it took a lot of prayer
5042472 weve got to drill now and weve got to drill here and weve got to be independent of foreign oil i know there are some here in california that disagree with that position
5042473 it was tough that vote because i went against a president i believed in and a party that believed i was disloyal very early in my political career
5042474 the truth is both democrats and republicans kind of like the status quo
5042475 if youve got book sales of 25 million then you qualify
5042476 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich
5042477 i dont believe in class warfare or redistribution of the wealth
5042478 this forum with rick warren fits in very well with what we know about the strategies of both of these campaigns to reach out to these key religious groups any one of which could make a difference in a close election
5042479 he missed the birth of his first son hes only been home for 18 months and hes leaving again

5042481 for me its a variety of things the role theyre going to play in the world their experience the environment is also a big issue for me
5042482 im just sitting here thinking what a miracle this is
5042483 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view
5042484 hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me
5042485 im not going to talk about conversations with the campaign
5042486 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the would rally around it
5042487 at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes
5042488 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the
5042489 i think its the responsibility of the vice president if youre unwilling or unable to do that then i think you should defer to someone else
5042490 i dont want to be vice president im not going to be the nominee
5042491 sometimes the first duty of intelligent men is the restatement of the obvious

5042530 to swim in the same era as him has been awesome
5042531 weve been talking about mark spitz for 36 years now
5042532 i dont know if im going to be alive when they stop talking about this bloke you wonder if we are going to see someone as good as this again
5042533 being able to have something like that to shoot for it made those days when i was tired and i didnt want to be there it made those days easier to look at spitz and say i want to do this
5042534 im just thankful for him having done what he did
5042535 the sport of swimming has come a long way so far and i think it can go even further
5042536 mike is opening a lot of doors with what hes doing
5042537 i just want to lay in my own bed for five minutes at least and just relax

5042541 another few weary steps and there was nothing above us but the sky
5042542 to this day it thrills me to know that if i can get the program right it will always work perfectly every time just the way i told it to experiencing this thrill was the beginning of my fascination with software
5042543 theres nothing like the eureka moment of discovering something that no one knew before i wont compare it to sex but it lasts longer
5042544 my feet are still on the ground im just wearing better shoes
5042545 what is behind it is the years of passion and dedication and hard work
5042546 being near or at the top certainly requires an enormous amount of time and effort and it doesnt come without collateral cost
5042547 its not a 9 to 5 job something elsewhere is going to have to suffer
5042548 as i stood in front of all of you for years in victory i stand in front of you today
5042549 a drunken savage whose plays please only in london and
5042550 ah how could i possibly admit such an infirmity in the one sense which should have been more perfect in me than in others
5042551 soon i would have to deal with something i had not known in my entire life pressure the pressure to defend my position the pressure to carry myself like a man and champion the pressure to meet demands and obligations that came with my new station and wealth the pressure to take on the obligations that come with being a professional anything and most demanding of all the pressure to win day after day round after round to hold my new position and potentially improve on it
5042552 let him have that monkey on his back for the next 25 30 35 years its not an easy thing
5042553 most of my friends thought i was a lot cooler i guess
5042554 it would kind of just be nice to be a regular person again
5042555 you plow ahead and make a hit and you plow on and someone passes you then someone passes them time levels
5042556 when you think of life as a living active process i dont think its a pleasurable activity unless you have some challenge in that life no matter what it is
5042557 i think in a way that is the philosophy of life
5042558 when im with a group of kids now they just yell out thats the cooking man
5042559 i walk down the streets of san francisco and every kid recognizes me and stops me and says hello you know thats really a wonderful thing
5042560 he knows how great he is but at the same time hes very humble
5042561 hes shocked to see how people still love him and remember him you see his eyes light up and it takes him back a moment when they chant ali ali its like charging a battery up
5042562 if i had to go through this i could at least be an example of trying to live out whats right trying to stand strong and trying to just keep my faith intact

5042616 what makes poets choice a collection of genuine and unusual interest is the diversity of voices that are heard and the variety of reasons given by the poets themselves for their stubborn unwillingness to be quiet
5042617 we knew that behind all books of poetry silent and placid on their shelves are actual men and women we knew that their lives are likely to be as intense if not always as beautiful as the lines of their poems we knew something of their attitude toward experience as the pages of their verse reveal it but we knew little of their attitude toward their own writing would a poet years after creating a poem have n affection for it or would he feel simple indifference if he did hold a strong feeling about it would he have the courage to confess that this poem above all others pleased him

5042682 there are extremely lucky to be alive in the circumstances the chances of the rescue party finding six corpses were at least as high as finding six live people
5042683 we had to tell a number of a high end clients looking for the steep and deep that its not going to happen
5042684 twenty years is a long time shot putters dont peak until the late 20s early 30s but i have been doing this for 10 years its been a long road well see the body holds up you have to make sure its all in one piece because you want to be walking when youre 50
5042685 im not very good with statistics im only 23 i wasnt even born then
5042686 get some sleep and support the rest of the track and field team
5042687 youve worked so hard the last 10 years of your sporting career for one moment one night and one day then its all over and down with i think it will sink in the next few days
5042688 then he hit the wall after that he couldnt remember anything you dont realise theres a big step up from the world championships to the olympics you realise why the olympics is the pinnacle of all sport
5042689 he was much much sicker afterwards this time even though he was on a drip you need a couple of days to get your condition back and he had lost weight
5042690 but hes so astonishing hes got this incredible ability to make himself do these astounding things i was just really relieved that he crossed the line and thrilled he got a medal
5042691 i think the most amazing thing was he got up and walked out to the ceremony i was just so excited i was jumping out of my skin
5042692 he got his medal and then he walked up and he gave me his flowers it was really lovely and moving he was a bit out of it and his eyes were going all over the place
5042693 im proud of my brother and the other rowers they left it all out there and they were really up against it
5042694 it was one of the most competitive fields and they really did show they were right up there mate i couldnt be more proud
5042695 he was pretty good mate you know and was probably off to a party for the rowers
5042696 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
5042697 the challenge for obama lies in not having this convention come to closure with a clear message of unity and enthusiasm
5042698 but its not in either clintons best interest to come out of this convention leaving the suggestion that shes being a spoiler
5042699 she has to go through the motions and make those motions very convincing
5042700 it will be a landmark by election it will be a deciding factor for anwar
5042701 i am touched by the overwhelming support it is no longer just a by election it is a lot more than that
5042702 it is a historic moment for malaysians especially the silent majority to convey how they want the nation to move ahead

5042716 to this day it thrills me to know that if i can get the program right it will always work perfectly every time just the way i told it to experiencing this thrill was the beginning of my fascination with software
5042717 theres nothing like the eureka moment of discovering something that no one knew before i wont compare it to sex but it lasts longer
5042718 my feet are still on the ground im just wearing better shoes
5042719 ive read that i flew up the hills and mountains of france but you dont fly up a hill you struggle slowly and painfully and maybe if you work very hard you get to the top ahead of everybody else
5042720 what is behind it is the years of passion and dedication and hard work
5042721 being near or at the top certainly requires an enormous amount of time and effort and it doesnt come without collateral cost
5042722 its not a 9 to 5 job something elsewhere is going to have to suffer
5042723 as i stood in front of all of you for years in victory i stand in front of you today
5042724 ah how could i possibly admit such an infirmity in the one sense which should have been more perfect in me than in others
5042725 soon i would have to deal with something i had not known in my entire life pressure the pressure to defend my position the pressure to carry myself like a man and champion the pressure to meet demands and obligations that came with my new station and wealth the pressure to take on the obligations that come with being a professional anything and most demanding of all the pressure to win day after day round after round to hold my new position and potentially improve on it
5042726 let him have that monkey on his back for the next 25 30 35 years its not an easy thing

5042733 i walk down the streets of san francisco and every kid recognizes me and stops me and says hello you know thats really a wonderful thing
5042734 he knows how great he is but at the same time hes very humble
5042735 hes shocked to see how people still love him and remember him you see his eyes light up and it takes him back a moment when they chant ali ali its like charging a battery up
5042736 nothing is real to us unless we make it real nothing can touch us unless we let it touch us refuse to have feelings hurt refuse to receive anyones condemnation believe and feel that you are wonderful this is not conceit it is the truth

5042740 but surely to enter the country you have to show your passport and id to people what is so different
5042741 well for one those people have all been granted the authority to ask for such identification for the security of themselves and the other passengers secondly you want a copy of my passport over a dispute on the height of your bushes
5042742 are you willing to negotiate on your price increase yes and there is a possibility i will stay put no and im afraid i will have to end my time here
5042743 refuse to see the negative in anyone refuse to let yourself misunderstand or be misunderstood know that everyone wants you to have the best then you will find things just as you wish them to be
5042744 never fade whatever you fully experience you never need to leave behind whatever you worry about losing you never did have to begin with without change life would not exist with every change is the opportunity to become more fully alive the days and weeks and years come to an end and yet it is always now the artifacts and remnants that you associate with the good times will fade and rust and decay eventually to disappear yet the goodness and joy of the authentic experiences will grow ever stronger there is no reason to be sad about the fact that time has passed there is every reason to find joy in the real treasures that you will always retain from that time learn to quickly let go of the meaningless superficial things that will soon be gone anyway invest your spirit and your experience in the timeless values that you know will never fade

5042776 beautiful villa just the style of villa we would pick ourselves enjoyed being here
5042777 our first visit to trnc and in 2 very short weeks we all felt completely at home with the country the people and this lovely property
5042778 there are a lot of new features on our handsets so we want to let young people know about them these tend to be pretty discerning consumers so we have to make sure the experience is brilliant
5042779 a technology wave is breaking and these people are the ones wholl get it first
5042780 social networking sites such as facebook are removing geographic barriers to keeping friends connected and findme adds a great new dimension by sharing locations among friends when and how they want to be seen
5042781 with our innovative approach to tagging cell tower locations rather than using gps it opens up this capability to anyone with a smartphone and a free facebook account
5042782 mr jobs confirmed such a capability exists but argued that apple needs it in case it inadvertently allows a malicious program one that stole users personal data for example to be distributed to
5042783 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
5042784 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5042785 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5042786 that fraud has increased and appraisal fraud has increased in a way to exacerbate the problems
5042787 the higher the loan amount the more money brokers and lenders make in the deal
5042788 and they threaten you they say if you dont play ball with us well go somewhere else and they do ive seen my business shrink theyre all doing it its hard to stay honest
5042789 faulty and fraudulent appraisals were an important contributor to the losses that the federal government suffered during the saving and loan crisis
5042790 we got to this point by a lack of enforcement the public has the right to expect the appraisal boards are taking care of that problem
5042791 do you know what that would have meant the net effect is it would have effectively shut down mortgage lending in that state
5042792 to take that action would have been an unbelievable disruption to the economy i wasnt going to do that
5042793 either you shut it off completely in a state or you just send letters
5042794 the threat of the atomic bomb is the only thing
5042795 they know they can keep doing what theyre doing because they can get away with it
5042796 theyre not getting punished and states arent doing more because they know regulators wont do a thing
5042797 i wasnt alone we had appraisers from all over the nation writing in and urging them to take action
5042798 resulting from inappropriate pressure being placed on real estate property appraisers to hit a certain value
5042799 people who say we should have done more dont understand how the system works
5042800 agencies just dont lobby to change things we had no interest in doing anything like that it just wasnt our area
5042801 good position to work with bank regulators and others on the problem
5042802 everything related to the issue went into a black hole why i just dont know
5042803 i tried to push but nobody wanted to hear what i was saying
5042804 problem appraisals are being allowed and in some ways even encouraged by a regulatory structure that promotes lax enforcement and ineffective oversight
5042805 we are here to alert congress that the licensing system it created for appraisers is broken and needs to be fixed
5042806 but states dont have the money to hire personnel to carry out what the system was designed to do
5042807 may have been rude or said my house wasnt worth as much as i thought
5042808 just because youre disciplined that doesnt make you a bad appraiser
5042809 i may have done some technical things wrong but ive done a good job im proud of my work
5042810 why should he get super zapped for doing a lot of little things that a lot of other appraisers are doing every day but havent had complaints turned in on them
5042811 there has to be effective enforcement of some sort there has to be reality to it
5042812 what are you going to do if there is pressure on appraisers how are you going to penalize someone who puts that pressure on appraisers whos going to do it whos going to enforce it they need to have that or it wont work
5042813 you can dip into almost any page and a line will make you smile

5042833 another few weary steps and there was nothing above us but the sky
5042834 to this day it thrills me to know that if i can get the program right it will always work perfectly every time just the way i told it to experiencing this thrill was the beginning of my fascination with software
5042835 theres nothing like the eureka moment of discovering something that no one knew before i wont compare it to sex but it lasts longer
5042836 my feet are still on the ground im just wearing better shoes
5042837 what is behind it is the years of passion and dedication and hard work
5042838 being near or at the top certainly requires an enormous amount of time and effort and it doesnt come without collateral cost
5042839 its not a 9 to 5 job something elsewhere is going to have to suffer
5042840 as i stood in front of all of you for years in victory i stand in front of you today
5042841 a drunken savage whose plays please only in london and
5042842 ah how could i possibly admit such an infirmity in the one sense which should have been more perfect in me than in others
5042843 soon i would have to deal with something i had not known in my entire life pressure the pressure to defend my position the pressure to carry myself like a man and champion the pressure to meet demands and obligations that came with my new station and wealth the pressure to take on the obligations that come with being a professional anything and most demanding of all the pressure to win day after day round after round to hold my new position and potentially improve on it
5042844 let him have that monkey on his back for the next 25 30 35 years its not an easy thing
5042845 most of my friends thought i was a lot cooler i guess
5042846 it would kind of just be nice to be a regular person again
5042847 you plow ahead and make a hit and you plow on and someone passes you then someone passes them time levels
5042848 when you think of life as a living active process i dont think its a pleasurable activity unless you have some challenge in that life no matter what it is
5042849 i think in a way that is the philosophy of life
5042850 when im with a group of kids now they just yell out thats the cooking man
5042851 i walk down the streets of san francisco and every kid recognizes me and stops me and says hello you know thats really a wonderful thing
5042852 he knows how great he is but at the same time hes very humble
5042853 hes shocked to see how people still love him and remember him you see his eyes light up and it takes him back a moment when they chant ali ali its like charging a battery up
5042854 we wanted to play better as we moved into the medal round
5042855 as a team 1 through 12 we did a good job we lost focus at times but were playing well
5042856 preliminary play was a good warmup for the challenge we have ahead
5042857 we saw a lot of different styles of basketball so that will prepare us
5042858 roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5042859 is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and his values
5042860 his mother lived in many states as far as we can tell but this is an example of the nonsense he uses to cover this up
5042861 how we could give some life to this contrast without turning negative
5042862 we think it was either fatah al islam or some unknown forces
5042863 i want to return this i bought it a year ago and its broken
5042864 im sorry but you dont have the box the power supply the driver cd or the receipt i cant let you return it
5042865 no i cant do that you need to keep the receipt for warranty claims i have no proof you even bought that from us
5042866 just send me the address of the home and i will look it up and work with the photographer on the shoot
5042867 its a million dollar home very very nice the listing agent wants to be there he wants a nice sunny shot its a million dollar home and i really want to make him happy
5042868 okay weve got a problem i know the listing agent wants to be at the shoot and he wants a sunny shot but we cant do that because it faces north were going to have to have to do a night shot or an early shot and hope the dawn light hits it
5042869 i know its a really nice home its vacant so we cant do an interior ill talk to the photographer but im sure hell agree that a night shot will be our best bet or the home will be backlit and not look good at all
5042870 i know but unless you or the listing agent can move the sun it will be at night or just after sunrise im sure the he wants the mansion to look good

5042876 as i write this amazon com like twitter is offline amazons outage is the big news friday morning but what of twitter
5042877 in the next 10 years the whole world of media communications and advertising are going to be turned upside down my opinion here are the premises i have number one there will be no media consumption left in 10 years that is not delivered over an ip network there will be no newspapers no magazines that are delivered in paper form everything gets delivered in an electronic form
5042878 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view
5042879 hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me
5042880 im not going to talk about conversations with the campaign
5042881 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the would rally around it

5042883 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the

5042885 i dont want to be vice president im not going to be the nominee
5042886 i dont want to be the vice president i am notgoing to be the nominee
5042887 the last time i checked the vice president is not anindependent voice he echoes the position of the president ofthe united states

5042892 no book was so bad but some good might be got out of it
5042893 babies were not washed as they emerged from the womb but sometimes licked by the mother
5042894 the most convincing clue we have comes from sir charles bell bell wrote that he once visited a spot on the tibet bhutan border where he saw a stupa called bang kar bi tse cho ten that contained the bodies of an eight year old boy and girl who had been slain for the purpose of some religious ritual
5042895 scenting the corpses and blood a demon took possession of the ch ten
5042896 the slavery in the chumbi valley was of a very mild type
5042897 more people were executed in china in the last three months than in the rest of the world for the last three years
5042898 told the government that they were only able to do it because their parents had told them how it was done
5042899 toil and trouble slavery is on the rise in china as number of poor migrants increases beijing appears unwilling and unable to prevent it
5042900 the two races differ strongly in many qualities which have their roots deep down in the characters of the two nations firstly the tibetans are deeply religious the tibetan government is truthful it can be slow obstinate and secretive in dealing with foreigners but it has a strong regard for truth but the chinese authorities from time to time made statements which were deliberately untrue the chinese are far more cruel than the tibetans are when they tried to conquer areas in tibet they used to put to death what prisoners of war they captured although the only offence of these was fighting in defence of their homeland the tibetans when they captured chinese prisoners of war used simply to send them back to china the chinese treat the granting of a favour merely as a step towards asking for another the tibetans do not treat favours in this way they have a national memory of things for which they are grateful many other examples of the differences dividing these two nations could be given for instance the status of women in tibet is higher than china the kinder treatment of animals and the more orderly government
5042901 a mans wealth was first and foremost measured through the number of sons he had
5042902 it was a matter of survival strong hardy sons were needed in every family to work and to fight bandits and settle feuds
5042903 a survey made in 1940 in eastern tibet came to a somewhat different conclusion it found that 38 percent of the households never got any tea but either collected herbs that grew wild or drank white tea boiled water it found that 51 percent could not afford to use butter and that 75 percent of the households were forced at times to resort to eating grass cooked with cow bones and mixed with oat or pea flower
5042904 there is no method of torture known that is not practised in here on these tibetans slicing boiling tearing asunder and all to sum up what china is doing here in eastern tibet the main things are collecting taxes robbing oppressing confiscating and allowing her representatives to burn and loot and steal
5042905 is credited with having introduced into tibet the use of butter tea cheese barley beer medical knowledge and astrology
5042906 all researchers reach a point of diminishing returns where to continue without publishing only postpones the inevitable
5042907 chinese tibetan and nepali sources are not very plentiful on the whole and not readily accessible even if one has the necessary language skills
5042908 who on the face of it had neither the qualification nor any business to write on india
5042909 we in india are accustomed to interested publication patronized patronized is accepted as an elegant synonym for subsidized by the government i hope miss mayo will not take offence if she comes under the shadow of such suspicion
5042910 they used to write that everything in china was wrong now they write that everything in china is right
5042911 this must surely rank as one of the wonders of the global village beijings master image makers giving lessons in balance and objectivity to american journalists
5042912 tibetan historian tom grunfeld a longtime friend and fellow ccas committee of concerned asian scholars activist from the 1970s with good access to senior chinese officials responsible for the territory was allowed to visit lhasa where he lobbied on our behalf two months later we were thrilled to receive a telex from the lhasa waiban inviting cnn to tibet
5042913 a decade earlier mutual aid teams were formed then agricultural cooperatives and finally in 1965 66 peoples communes mechanization has begun and experimental agricultural stations have developed more resilient higher yield grains as well as strains of tobacco tea sugar beets and a dozen vegetables which can grow readily in the climate of the roof of the world innovations such as insecticides chemical fertilizers irrigation and veterinary medicine have been introduced into a land that hardly even know of their existence in short the lot of the tibetan people has improved immeasurably
5042914 there were between three to four thousand villages and towns each having between three to four thousand families with four to five thousand people from each town and village about 800 to 1 000 people were imprisoned out of this at least 300 to 400 people of them died in prison
5042915 if there was a film made on all the atrocities perpetrated in qinghai province it would shock the viewers in golok area many people were killed and their dead bodies were rolled down the hill into a big ditch the soldiers told the family members and relatives of the dead people that they should all celebrate since the rebels had been wiped out they were even forced to dance on the dead bodies soon after they were also massacred with machine guns they were all buried there
5042916 you will take your shower tonight rather than tomorrow morning
5042917 never you see the sheet on the refrigerator youve read it
5042918 normally no your shower must occur before 9 30 but ill make an exception this time
5042919 you may make a lunch and eat it elsewhere at the lake or where have you
5042920 so i can come into the kitchen to make a sandwich and then go elsewhere to eat it
5042921 no you must make it the morning or night before
5042922 mme r might i inquire as to why i cannot use the kitchen for lunch
5042923 well you see there must be time to spend with family and friends

5042929 how am i supposed to know where i am going i feel like youre abandoning me
5042930 it must feel good to be taken care of and protected like you are
5042931 you know every morning for the past week a fine looking gentleman in a military uniform has been standing across the corner watching you as you get off the bus
5042932 what a great world it would be to live in
5042933 is the ghost story just a relic a sort of literary tourist trap of the character of mary kings close or is it a peculiarly scottish exercise which confers a real distinction on this land
5042934 this wasnt a visit it was telling me to go away and never come back
5042935 we are seeing more investment in social and supportive housing than ever in the history of the city
5042936 the downtown eastside will be for many years a place you find people of low incomes
5042937 there has been an effort to keep all the social problems in one neighbourhood and i do not think that serves the people who have those problems very well
5042938 we find that when they can move outside the downtown eastside a lot of problems go away
5042939 when you start having numbers of people camping out you start moving into personal safety issues
5042940 before anyone could be harmed a solution even short term needed to be found
5042941 it was a public relations disaster to have 40 people in tents just a couple of blocks from gm place where olympics events will be happening
5042942 no one is being pushed out of any area because of the olympics
5042943 certainly you cannot handle all their addiction and mental health issues in the downtown eastside some people would do better if they were given opportunities we are not going to take them and force them to go anywhere but certainly the options have to be there for them
5042944 were certainly open to helping anyone who wants to do that
5042945 were looking at the entire province not just the downtown eastside when were looking at housing
5042946 we said you guys find the land in the communities and we are there with capital and thats what weve been doing
5042947 if we can get somebody in an environment where there are other supports around them their success rate is definitely higher than if we leave them isolated in the downtown eastside
5042948 theyre told they can get a one way ticket either to some other part of canada or some other part of the province
5042949 its the difference between wearing jammies to bed and wearing your work clothes to bed
5042950 unbifurcated garments are far more comfortable and suitable to male anatomy than trousers or shorts because they dont confine the legs or cramp the male genitals the way that trousers or shorts do
5042951 please open your hearts and inseams for an option in mail carrier comfort
5042952 i got so pumped up after being at such a low that im taking this to the next convention in 2010 in anaheim calif
5042953 i heard about facebook and wanted to know what it was about i love being online and it beats writing with a pen
5042954 more and more people are on facebook now but at 102 i have a lot to put on about myself
5042955 ive only got nine friends on the net at the moment but im hoping for lots more im going to put some of my photos on my page
5042956 ivy loves going on facebook were trying to keep all our residents independent by letting them use the computer
5042957 the second launch of the safir rocket carrying the first satellite omid was conducted successfully
5042958 the achievement has drawn much attention from around the world especially from among muslim nations as iran is under heavy sanctions by the west and the un security council making it develop the technology and build every part and equipment needed in the field of aerospace
5042959 this satellite the rocket and the launch station are entirely iranian built achieved by particularly talented scientists and technicians
5042960 the patient must utilise the technology usefully in the correct perspective instead of dissection discussion and hair splitting
5042961 the internet which is very useful to most of us can supply ideas to the patient to gain knowledge to pose intelligent questions to the urologist and forget the actual purpose of the visit to the doctor
5042962 the urologist may have a tough time treating such patients successfully and satisfactorily
5042963 the way i look at it if you get something from a doctor you dont like you find a doctor that gives you better options i found another doctor who said id live seven to 20 years so i like that doctor better
5042964 ive missed two of the three games with richmond senior since andrew has been on the varsity
5042965 he tries to be involved as much as he can without being intrusive
5042966 i aspire to be as strong as him and tough in all areas of life
5042967 i knew it drove him crazy to be as uninvolved as he was just going to the games i was happy for him that hes found a way to get a little more satisfaction feeling a part of the team
5042968 he could play linebacker for us but hes sacrificed for the team to play offensive line
5042969 hes a little undersized to be a lineman 6 1 220 but hes tough as nails
5042970 i dont know what level of football he can play but he would be a valuable member of any team because hes that kind of kid
5042971 its important for our family as much as it is for the team
5042972 its a last chance to get a ring im just ready to get going
5042973 im just a dad whos kind of sick whos looking forward to watching his son play
5042974 being promoted to bbc one and gaining a wider audience
5042975 for a long time people kind of got use to going to the doctors and filing a claim now its like we want the whole bill upfront
5042976 we are like any other business we have to collect our money to pay our bills its far easier to collect upfront than to go after someone on the back end
5042977 its reasonable to go an eye doctor on monday and then visit other doctors on wednesday and thursday and there will be an overpayment
5042978 the doctor said well it looks like hes got all the symptoms of west nile virus
5042979 i called the state health department because i needed to know how long he was going to be sick
5042980 i was just bawling i thought he was going to die
5042981 he was diagnosed with epstein barr virus which is pretty much the same thing but you dont die from it
5042982 i dont blame him because all the doctors are doing it
5042983 id like to know how many people have been told they have west nile
5042984 this has been going on since west nile came into utah some doctors will base things on symptoms and not do tests
5042985 like any medical test they can be expensive and if people dont have insurance then sometimes the doctor will go ahead and try to help the patient
5042986 whether theyre helping or not may be something of a question
5042987 he said well it sounds like youve got west nile
5042988 it was really strange it was just contradictory to what we had heard on the news and what seemed to be happening everywhere
5042989 i ended up going to the doctor in the springtime
5042990 they found out that i was really anemic the question i have now is did i ever really have it am i immune to it am i going to get it again
5042991 people who have been told they have it are out on the lake not really worrying about it
5042992 i cant imagine how many people have been told that
5042993 maybe theres something seriously wrong that they dont know about and they say nah its west nile
5042994 we try to do education for physicians and stuff like that thats the best we can do is try to educate people of what tests to draw and those kinds of things
5042995 thats the only way to tell for sure if theres west nile
5042996 this is the first case that ive seen in my 12 years in a situation where you have patients with legitimate and serious problems who are receiving a drug that is not authorized by the food drug and administration
5042997 never has any media outlet called me to check the athletes ages
5042998 the fig has received confirmation from the international olympic committee that all passports are valid for all gymnasts competing in the beijing olympic games
5042999 stringent control measures are taken at the time of athlete accreditation for all official fig competitions further all athlete ages for the beijing olympic games are consistent with the fig records for all past fig competitions
5043000 the state is the only one in india to have its own constitution and the president of india cannot issue directions to the state government in exercise of the executive power of the union as he can in every other state kashmiri are indian citizens but indians are not necessarily kashmiri citizens we cannot vote for elections to their assembly or own any property in kashmir

5043008 es dudoso que est garantizado un control amplio de todos los seguidores

5043019 the point at which the vision of eyes crosses opens the mythological all seeing 3rd eye of god we contain eumelanin abundantly in our hair skin eyes and pineal glands

5043026 in any form of cricket whether in test or one dayer the start to an innings is important but it does not mean the entire pressure is on the openers to always give you a good start
5043027 sehwag is sort of a player who takes a bit of risk he is a strokeplayer and there is a fair amount of risk involved so whenever he gives us a good start then we get a fair chance to win the game
5043028 he is also presently in a very good nick as he and gautam gambhir have played well in the test series also of course they will have some added responsibility but no real pressure
5043029 when in form he jayasuriya is always a great value because he can add so much with the bat and as well when he is bowling
5043030 he can always contribute and the start he gets us makes a huge difference

5043280 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
5043281 we have been supportive of democratic elections that took place in pakistan in fact advocated for them
5043282 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view
5043283 hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me
5043284 im not going to talk about conversations with the campaign
5043285 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it
5043286 at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes
5043287 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states
5043288 i think its the responsibility of the vice president if youre unwilling or unable to do that then i think you should defer to someone else
5043289 i dont want to be vice president im not going to be the nominee
5043290 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5043291 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5043292 faulty and fraudulent appraisals were an important contributor to the losses that the federal government suffered during the saving and loan crisis
5043293 we got to this point by a lack of enforcement the public has the right to expect the appraisal boards are taking care of that problem
5043294 do you know what that would have meant the net effect is it would have effectively shut down mortgage lending in that state
5043295 to take that action would have been an unbelievable disruption to the economy i wasnt going to do that
5043296 poging zijn om de onderlinge verdeeldheid bij de palestijnen aan te wakkeren
5043297 another few weary steps and there was nothing above us but the sky
5043298 to this day it thrills me to know that if i can get the program right it will always work perfectly every time just the way i told it to experiencing this thrill was the beginning of my fascination with software
5043299 theres nothing like the eureka moment of discovering something that no one knew before i wont compare it to sex but it lasts longer
5043300 my feet are still on the ground im just wearing better shoes
5043301 ive read that i flew up the hills and mountains of france but you dont fly up a hill you struggle slowly and painfully and maybe if you work very hard you get to the top ahead of everybody else
5043302 what is behind it is the years of passion and dedication and hard work
5043303 being near or at the top certainly requires an enormous amount of time and effort and it doesnt come without collateral cost
5043304 its not a 9 to 5 job something elsewhere is going to have to suffer
5043305 as i stood in front of all of you for years in victory i stand in front of you today
5043306 ah how could i possibly admit such an infirmity in the one sense which should have been more perfect in me than in others
5043307 soon i would have to deal with something i had not known in my entire life pressure the pressure to defend my position the pressure to carry myself like a man and champion the pressure to meet demands and obligations that came with my new station and wealth the pressure to take on the obligations that come with being a professional anything and most demanding of all the pressure to win day after day round after round to hold my new position and potentially improve on it
5043308 let him have that monkey on his back for the next 25 30 35 years its not an easy thing
5043309 most of my friends thought i was a lot cooler i guess
5043310 it would kind of just be nice to be a regular person again
5043311 you plow ahead and make a hit and you plow on and someone passes you then someone passes them time levels
5043312 when you think of life as a living active process i dont think its a pleasurable activity unless you have some challenge in that life no matter what it is
5043313 i think in a way that is the philosophy of life
5043314 when im with a group of kids now they just yell out thats the cooking man
5043315 i walk down the streets of san francisco and every kid recognizes me and stops me and says hello you know thats really a wonderful thing
5043316 he knows how great he is but at the same time hes very humble
5043317 hes shocked to see how people still love him and remember him you see his eyes light up and it takes him back a moment when they chant ali ali its like charging a battery up
5043318 the appraiser said the house was worth 114 500 so why would we sell it for 100 000
5043319 i called regularly to ask for updates but most of the time they never returned my calls finally i just gave up
5043320 the mere fact that a number of complaints have been filed against a person doesnt mean that all of the complaints reach the level of where there needs to be disciplinary action taken
5043321 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5043322 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5043323 that fraud has increased and appraisal fraud has increased in a way to exacerbate the problems
5043324 the higher the loan amount the more money brokers and lenders make in the deal
5043325 and they threaten you they say if you dont play ball with us well go somewhere else and they do ive seen my business shrink theyre all doing it its hard to stay honest
5043326 faulty and fraudulent appraisals were an important contributor to the losses that the federal government suffered during the saving and loan crisis
5043327 we got to this point by a lack of enforcement the public has the right to expect the appraisal boards are taking care of that problem
5043328 do you know what that would have meant the net effect is it would have effectively shut down mortgage lending in that state
5043329 to take that action would have been an unbelievable disruption to the economy i wasnt going to do that
5043330 either you shut it off completely in a state or you just send letters
5043331 the threat of the atomic bomb is the only thing
5043332 they know they can keep doing what theyre doing because they can get away with it
5043333 theyre not getting punished and states arent doing more because they know regulators wont do a thing
5043334 i wasnt alone we had appraisers from all over the nation writing in and urging them to take action
5043335 resulting from inappropriate pressure being placed on real estate property appraisers to hit a certain value
5043336 people who say we should have done more dont understand how the system works
5043337 agencies just dont lobby to change things we had no interest in doing anything like that it just wasnt our area
5043338 good position to work with bank regulators and others on the problem
5043339 everything related to the issue went into a black hole why i just dont know
5043340 i tried to push but nobody wanted to hear what i was saying
5043341 problem appraisals are being allowed and in some ways even encouraged by a regulatory structure that promotes lax enforcement and ineffective oversight
5043342 we are here to alert congress that the licensing system it created for appraisers is broken and needs to be fixed
5043343 but states dont have the money to hire personnel to carry out what the system was designed to do
5043344 may have been rude or said my house wasnt worth as much as i thought
5043345 just because youre disciplined that doesnt make you a bad appraiser
5043346 i may have done some technical things wrong but ive done a good job im proud of my work
5043347 why should he get super zapped for doing a lot of little things that a lot of other appraisers are doing every day but havent had complaints turned in on them
5043348 it will be a landmark by election it will be a deciding factor for anwar
5043349 i am touched by the overwhelming support it is no longer just a by election it is a lot more than that
5043350 it is a historic moment for malaysians especially the silent majority to convey how they want the nation to move ahead
5043351 that is what he is crying for we cannot ignore that
5043352 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5043353 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5043354 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5043355 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5043356 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5043357 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5043358 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5043359 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5043360 determinata mantovana quarantaduenne prima rivincita sulla tradizione gerontocratica nostrana lo far tra breve visto che ora deve scegliersi la squadra se come pare dalle prime indiscrezioni sar a sua immagine e somiglianza smetteremo finalmente di vedere la solita stomachevole
5043361 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5043362 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5043363 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5043364 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5043365 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5043366 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5043367 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5043368 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5043369 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5043370 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5043371 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5043372 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5043373 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

5043379 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5043380 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5043381 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5043382 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5043383 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5043384 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

5043391 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5043392 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

5043439 be cool man its a girl laura wietzman from chatsworth
5043440 fine man as long as you promise to fuck her
5043441 im kinda out for a few hours just a few hours
5043442 some guy who wants weed been coming by here every hour poor guy
5043443 this is just so weird to be sitting smoking with you and you are a drug dealer
5043444 you are really funny im really glad i came to see you
5043445 nah but it could be my supplier and then ill have tons of weed
5043446 nice ive got the kindest buds in the world with me my buddy drove it down himself from washington
5043447 ive heard of it oh my god you dont have it
5043448 i knew that we had won it there was nobody coming back at that point
5043449 i never thought id get the opportunity to be a favourite in an olympics again
5043450 just to come in as a favourite is an amazing experience to do it twice is just amazing and to win i cant say anymore
5043451 we started everything we could in the first 500 to get ourselves into the race and essentially through the middle its a dogfight everybody wants a piece of it
5043452 we knew that we had a really solid 500 and it was just a matter of not waiting for it but going everyone together we closed the eyes and went for it
5043453 coming into the last 500 we seemed to get our rhythm and ian said go for it we committed everything we had and went
5043454 we knew it was tight we really had no idea where we were when we started that sprint
5043455 it was exhausting there wasnt anything left in the end
5043456 when we looked over i could see that our bow ball was definitely in front of the germans it was just making sure the judges were with us
5043457 after our first two races we kind of had a tendency of sort of getting caught in the last 500 so we made it our mission to really execute that last 500 and lay it all down on the line and i think we did that
5043458 the whole thing every race one after the other from winning by one hundredth of a second to finishing it off with a world record its an amazing experience and something ill have forever
5043459 i literally wanted to do something that no ones ever done before in this sport
5043460 its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster its been nothing but fun
5043461 it was tough to lose the 50m freestyle by one hundredth of a second
5043462 i realized i shouldnt have filed my nails last night
5043463 i did this in sydney 2000 but i was 33 then
5043464 when i was in the warm up area and saw phelps he said to me youve got it easy you only have to swim two races
5043465 when i was on the blocks this time i didnt feel like everyone else was better than me i know now that is rubbish i can do this
5043466 what ive done is show them middle aged adults that you can do it
5043467 im absolutely thrilled if i can help thats a rewarding experience i have had a fabulous time being part of the u s olympic team its been awesome
5043468 this year was difficult because of the penalty i got but thank god for my talent ive been given
5043469 i got the african record in the finals you never know what can happen you could get last or first in the olympic games anything can happen it was a miracle and for once the miracle was for me
5043470 the 400 was my best ranking that i have prepared for all year i got fifth place expecting the best
5043471 i just feel very privileged that i have been here to witness michael phelps win eight gold medals
5043472 for me that was the highlight i couldnt care less about my swims i feel very privileged that i was in the same era as such a great swimmer
5043473 it was an awesome feat because she is the most decorated swimmer
5043474 when i went into this meet i was so nervous going into this olympics with six events
5043475 i have never done it at such a high caliber but it got better as i went on
5043476 when i crossed the line and saw sherone and kerron there that was the moment
5043477 i tried to follow the pace and follow the strategies i made i feel bad that it didnt go well
5043478 in romania they have always expected a lot from gymnasts especially for gymnastics from this olympics the romanian coaches and athletes have a lot of pressure
5043479 it was really hard to go back into the gym after what happened but i kept training
5043480 i wish i walked away with a medal on pommel horse but im happy that the team got a medal and thats the most important thing to me
5043481 with my set i laid out a hard routine and i wasnt ready
5043482 i wasnt sure how things were going to hold up today but i didnt really care about scores
5043483 i didnt care about placements i just wanted to go out and have a good time sitting there and watching seven other girls compete was the most nerve wracking experience
5043484 not in my best dreams could i have imagined this
5043485 its very special just to compete here ive had an incredible experience with all my countrymen i have to thank everyone that has been here with me the last two weeks
5043486 to be honest it does mean more for me to win it with serena to share this kind of moment with your sister
5043487 i mean we are practically joined at the hip its really unexplainable i have chill bumps
5043488 i want to enjoy my gold medal that ive been working so hard to get this just means so much to me
5043489 today must be the most memorable moment in my life
5043490 i love this sport and id like to go on diving if i can
5043491 we rode a boat called the hunter we hunted everyone all the way down
5043492 you just cant let it get to you there are other things way more important
5043493 im waiting for some really good thing to happen from this because everything happens for a reason
5043494 i didnt feel my finger shaking but i guess it was
5043495 i realized it went off and i hope it made it to the black i call it a freak of nature
5043496 what happened today i think will keep him going keep him determined and he will be more experienced
5043497 but i did not want another loss i let a couple of points go by being lazy but it worked out for me
5043498 i think there is a nation in every sport that dominates
5043499 in games like this if we can get the win in early we will
5043500 its getting us ready for the challenge up ahead it will help us prepare for korea who likes to play at a fast pace and likes to shoot threes
5043501 they practice more than theyre used to theyre focused on themselves and getting better
5043502 for me to be the last one a guy whos been boxing only three years im speechless
5043503 it was no disrespect for the other fighter but it was pointless for me to be in there
5043504 theres no way he hit me 11 times i blocked him he probably scored three or four points but not more than that
5043505 i had a lot of sleepless nights because i was nervous but this allowed me to concentrate more and train harder
5043506 each team we face is just one step that we have to climb but we are very focused on what we came here to do
5043507 in my second snatch i hurt my elbow and the doctor tried to fix it
5043508 i was worried that i could not compete but my coached helped me and gave me confidence he helped me stand up psychologically
5043509 its been a lifelong dream of mine to wrestle in the olympic games i never stopped believing it would happen i want to thank usa wrestling and usa wrestling executive director rich bender for making this happen im looking forward to having an opportunity to wrestle in the olympics and bringing home a gold medal
5043510 the conditions today were quite great britain big wind and big rain we were quite prepared
5043511 i felt very good after that and well play tomorrows game against taiwan in a good mood because of it
5043512 ive got my confidence back and am in a high spirit after that final hit
5043513 the team has very good results but i am a bit disappointed with mine i hope we do better tomorrow

5043515 i said to anelka today you have three or four chances and you have to make one or two goals for me and for the people because i want the people to believe in you

5043542 and i saw a great and wondrous sign in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars and she being with child cries travailing in birth and pained to be delivered and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born and she brought forth a man child who is to rule all the nations and the child was caught up unto god and to his throne and the woman fled into the wilderness where she hath the place prepared of god that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days and then when the dragon saw it he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child and to the woman were given two wings of the great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time from the face of the serpent and the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood and the earth helped the woman and opened her mouth and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth and the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the saints of her seed which keep the commandments of god and have the testimony of jesus
5043543 saw and persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child and to the woman were given two wings of the great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time from the face of the serpent

5043556 a cyber warfare campaign by russia is seriously disrupting many georgian websites
5043557 on the contrary a number of internet sites belonging to the russian media and official organisations have fallen victim to concerted hacker attacks
5043558 we can expect to see cyber attacks being increasingly used as a weapon
5043559 as well as being a critical resource for government ministries the internet also plays an important role in the running of countries and this disruption can damage economies
5043560 aunque no pienso en el oro voy pelea a pelea estoy convencido de que nuestro equipo va a conseguir m s medallas
5043561 me he quitado una gran presi n y ahora puedo hacer mucho mejor las cosas
5043562 la medalla era muy importante para mi y el pueblo cubano

5043578 as much as interstate wins are difficult you only get four points so what it means is we stay in the eight and weve got destiny in our own control thats what it means
5043579 whats momentum im not being smart but everyone talks about momentum and gee whiz weve won one we just get some confidence back that we are a reasonable team
5043580 well i tell you what you cant win finals and play in them until youre in them and we are clearly not in them so that questions irrelevant
5043581 everyone led but in particular at the pointy end riewoldt and lenny hayes were outstanding he riewoldt is our captain he plays with presence the bottom line is you need your leaders playing well and he did that today
5043582 he didnt want to have a farewell game himself hes one of those guys that doesnt like the attention of playing the last game

5043601 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5043602 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5043603 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5043604 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

5043606 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5043607 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5043608 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5043609 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5043610 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5043611 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5043612 that guy that kept sending out e mails about wit of mandamus
5043613 you know i just cant do it i was up until 4am reading for this class and didnt get to this last case

5043615 its my party i can fob if i want to
5043616 thats not a nose ring this is a nose ring
5043617 stick a fork two fingers in me im done with law school
5043618 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5043619 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5043620 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5043621 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5043622 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5043623 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5043624 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5043625 edinburgh zoo penguin and colonel in chief of the norwegian kings guard nils olav inspects his regiment in edinburgh where he was given a medal by the norwegian king
5043626 the practice of honouring penguins at edinburgh zoo began in the early 1970s when a young lieutenant from the norwegian army nils egelien fell in love with the penguin colony and happened upon the idea of having one of the king penguins as a regimental mascot and honorary member

5043637 de var gode det var vi ikke og ja vi er nu kommet helt ned p jorden igen efter sejren i manchester
5043638 its a really great feeling and it shows what we are capable of achieving
5043639 when i dropped down to sixth i was worried that i wouldnt be able to fight back but my confidence grew and i was able to catch up with john and pass him
5043640 the grip levels dropped off towards the end so there was nothing i could do about shinya but i felt so much more comfortable on the bike than i have previously and the bridgestone tyres definitely had an advantage over some of the other riders
5043641 its obviously disappointing to finish 11th especially after feeling so strong early on
5043642 i got a great start and sat behind the suzuki riders while they battled things out for third

5043648 he salido bien he intentado mantenerme en la primera vuelta pero en la segunda de seguida se me ha empezado a ir mucho la moto de delante a la que intentaba forzar y ya iba con cuidado para no caerme ha habido una vuelta que he estado a punto de caerme dos veces y he intento llevar un ritmo m s lento pero era imposible
5043649 para colmo he empezado a tener problemas con el neum tico de atr s y al final iba con tiempos de las motos de 250 cc muy despacio ha sido muy vergonzoso tener que pilotar de esa manera no s lo que sienten en el equipo para m hoy no he corrido he dado unas vueltas un paseo
5043650 lo primero es volver a motivarme y seguir hay que intentar no perder la ilusi n en las cosas antes de venir al gran premio los propios de michelin ya te dijeron bueno los entrenos no fueron muy bien aqu ya no llegas con la ilusi n que deber a ser
5043651 creo que el mundial est perdido con el error de stoner rossi no debe tener ninguna presi n aunque alg n d a quedemos por delante de l
5043652 lo importante cuando uno se equivoca es afrontarlo ponerte cara a cara y decir no lo hice bien esto es lo mejor que uno puede hacer ponerse de cara al problema y apartarlo de delante esta es la nica opci n que tengo
5043653 el error no es ni de honda ni de dani pedrosa el error es de quien hace los neum ticos que no los hace bien ese es el error si los neum ticos fueran competitivos en todas las carreras no habr a ning n problema

5043656 todays race was probably the worst of my career in fact i couldnt even race all i could do was ride
5043657 i couldnt control the bike i didnt feel safe i was riding so slow i felt impotent and ashamed i considered stopping but i stayed out there to get some points i almost crashed twice so i just tried to finish the race i did my best in very difficult circumstances

5043662 to show that we support the georgian people and also the government to deal with the work there is to do
5043663 the security zone is temporary this is not disputed by any of the parties
5043664 it is more important that foreign observers arrive so it is not only troops of the commonwealth of independent states cis

5043669 a fresh terrorist attack certainly would be a big advantage to him
5043670 its just not true if he said that and i do not know the context i strenuously disagree

5043672 terrorist attacks dont help anybody not me not my opponent and certainly not the people of america
5043673 the second launch of the safir rocket carrying the first satellite omid was conducted successfully
5043674 the achievement has drawn much attention from around the world especially from among muslim nations as iran is under heavy sanctions by the west and the un security council making it develop the technology and build every part and equipment needed in the field of aerospace
5043675 this satellite the rocket and the launch station are entirely iranian built achieved by particularly talented scientists and technicians

5043677 excuse me but i thought the menu said the fish sandwich was fifteen dollars

5043706 i think john mccains reaction to what happened in russia did not reflect well on the position he should have taken and that is one of understanding we have one president in this country and that secretary of state rice and president bush need the support of both presidential candidates in a very tricky time as it relates to russia and the neighboring states that are trying to establish democracies
5043707 i think him doing press releases and sending some of his political allies to georgia i think some of it began to ring like a political campaign instead of principled and strong diplomacy
5043708 they accused barack obama of being presumptuous for going to europe and meeting with our allies
5043709 what is presumptuous is to try to undercut in any way the very difficult and tricky work that president bush and secretary rice are trying to do right now

5043790 what if they get in there and make it worse
5043791 one thing that im absolutely convinced of is that there is a moral and ethical element to this issue and so i think anyone who tries to deny the moral difficulties and gravity of the abortion issue is not paying attention
5043792 i am pro choice i believe in roe v wade and i come to that conclusion not because i am pro abortion but because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually they struggle with these decisions profoundly
5043793 as for the social issues tonight should throw a damper on the notion that obama is going to make major inroads among evangelicals voters why would they vote for his social liberalism couched in exquisite equivocations when they can vote for someone who agrees with them on most everything like john mccain

5043796 im gonna come out with a story i think is gonna be earth shaking and that is from steven jones the physicist from byu whos been dismissed well hes now gotten samples of the world trade center dust and hes demonstrated the dust has formed these spheres these iron spheres that can only be formed under extremely high temperatures and i know enough about the science to know hes right the fire from jet fuel does not burn hot enough to produce the physical evidence that hes produced so when youve got science that the hypothesis doesnt explain evidence then the hypothesis doesnt stand anymore it just means the governments explanation of the jet fuel fire is not a sufficient explanation to explain the evidence of these spheres these microcopic spheres that steven jones has proved existed within the wtc dust in attacking these things first scientifically for me what tips the scales is when youve got science that the conventional hypothesis doesnt explain

5043803 kevin barett michael rupert james fetzer christopher boylan posted by rese at 08 17 2008 05 38am obsession with crime and punishment under fascist regimes the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws the people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism there is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations
5043804 rampant cronyism and corruption fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and who use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability
5043805 fraudulent elections sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham

5043839 the mayor feels that the city can no longer afford to run a zoo
5043840 i agree its not a mission critical function for a city to run a zoo
5043841 well see whats out there where we could put them where they would fit in that will send a signal to the people that the zoo is in the process of renewing itself and worthy of their support
5043842 not all projects get funded every year but they get in a queue
5043843 so if the city came back in 2010 and said this is our top priority it is very likely that it would get funded
5043844 if that passes the zoo would get a dedicated amount perhaps more than 200 000 out of that every year
5043845 the success of the zoo will be based upon the people who visit the zoo and members who support the zoo they are really in control of the situation

5043847 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5043848 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5043849 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5043850 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5043851 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5043852 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5043853 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5043854 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5043855 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5043856 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5043857 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5043858 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5043859 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5043860 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5043861 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5043862 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5043863 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5043864 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5043865 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5043866 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5043867 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5043868 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5043869 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5043870 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5043871 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5043872 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5043873 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5043874 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5043875 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5043876 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza

5043879 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5043880 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5043881 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5043882 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5043883 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5043884 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5043885 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5043886 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5043887 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5043888 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena

5043898 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche

5043902 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
5043903 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
5043904 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5043905 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5043906 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5043907 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
5043908 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5043909 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5043910 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5043911 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5043912 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5043913 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5043914 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5043915 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5043916 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5043917 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
5043918 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
5043919 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
5043920 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
5043921 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
5043922 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

5043925 pienso que hoy estaba m s dif cil el recorrido s lo hay que ver los pocos jinetes que han acabado con cero
5043926 estaba concentrado y todo pero ocurri el desastre no fue un exceso de confianza
5043927 me duele mucho que no me qued arriba del caballo si hubiera estado arriba ahora brasil hubiera pasado y yo no estar a eliminado
5043928 ahora cada uno a pensar en el desempe o personal cada uno para s y a pasar el corte de los 35 ma ana lunes
5043929 es muy diferente de lo que saltamos el otro d a son obst culos m s altos y m s t cnicos el recorrido de hoy es duro pero factible no es descabellado s lo que es un recorrido de unos juegos
5043930 la parte complicada lo es para todos los caballos no es que beneficie a ning n caballo en particular es la magia del recorrido que no est a favor de un caballo en concreto
5043931 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar algo no solo est equivocado sino que pone en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer para resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche quien no entiende a la buena entender con la fuerza del derecho

5043945 there is a world of difference between searching for happiness and choosing to be happy
5043946 it is exceptional the degree to which the militarys currently relying on such contractors
5043947 were of a much smaller scale than what we are seeing in iraq
5043948 the cost of having an army contingent provide the same services as blackwater appears to be roughly the same as the cost of the contract itself

5043975 sabemos que en los cuartos de final jugaremos con grecia o china lo bueno es que tendremos cuatro d as para preparar ese partido

5043982 i just couldnt live on one healthy foot anymore let alone try to skate
5043983 weve tried everything to avoid surgery because we knew it would mean missing a chunk of the season but nothing worked
5043984 ryan has been bothered by this condition in his foot for some time
5043985 he consulted with a number of specialists in an effort to correct the problem without surgery but it was ultimately determined that surgery was the best path to take for his general well being and for his career
5043986 i need to perform better than i did and i know that is the expectation
5043987 but ive always thought skating was the biggest part of my game and last season i couldnt skate like i can

5043990 this is the first time anyone has done really fundamental hands on quantum mechanics with an organic led
5043991 we can convert the spin information into a current and manipulate it and change it
5043992 we are manipulating this information and reading it out again we are writing it and reading it
5043993 even the smallest transistor today consists of hundreds of thousands of atoms
5043994 the ultimate goal of miniaturization is to implement electronics on the scale of atoms and electrons
5043995 just like a mass on a spring the pulse produces an oscillation of the spins of singlets and triplets in the organic led
5043996 this work demonstrates that we can get a complete genome for a totally unknown organism
5043997 we extracted a complete genome from a very complex community and this is something novel
5043998 you can only use amplification when you know what youre trying to get and thats the problem
5043999 when you want to discover something unknown amplification is a very deficient technique because you keep discovering the things you already know so how can you discover the unknown

5044002 the reasoning was that those who were offended could turn away
5044003 but that doesnt prevent the state from criminalizing a verbal assault of repeated loud profanities in a public place that disrupts the rights of others
5044004 but you dont have the right to continue to assault people with offensive speech once theyve indicated they dont want to hear it
5044005 he debido dejar la pierna de paso un poquito atr s y no recuerdo m s quedaban 300 metros y he visto que quedaba el tercer puesto cerquita he tirado y he besado el suelo como se suele decir

5044010 una mezcla de iconograf a infantil con libertad de pensamiento y de frivolidad en el tono con una elevada ambici n intelectual
5044011 net als onze landgenoot bolt die een dag eerder de 100 meter bij de mannen won red hebben we geschiedenis geschreven hij met zijn wereldrecord wij met het podium
5044012 we zijn allemaal groot atleten en ik ben ontzettend trots op de ongelooflijke prestatie die wij hebben neergezet namens ons land
5044013 de mannen hadden voor jamaica hetzelfde moeten doen als wij bij de vrouwen
5044014 ik dacht dat de fotofinish tussen mij en simpson ging
5044015 i just thought right now id like to find out if i like coaching instead of putting in four years at a university to get my accounting degree and then thinking maybe i do want to try coaching
5044016 ive put in a lot more than four years in hockey
5044017 ive got 25 27 years of experience might as well give that a shot first
5044018 i didnt wake up yesterday and think man i cant play hockey anymore
5044019 i cant change the fact that my knee is arthritic and not up to the rigours of the nhl any longer
5044020 i thought id be comfortable getting my feet wet in the coaching ring with those guys
5044021 i just thought man i already feel like i spent a lot of time at the rink as a player and missed out on certain things with my kids
5044022 and i didnt know if i was ready for that or that i wanted to do that
5044023 when i was trying to play that was much more difficult
5044024 the coaching staff the organization and even myself expect a certain kind of performance out of me
5044025 and it just wasnt physically possible to do it that was stressful and almost depressing at times its almost like you wake up every day feeling miserable
5044026 im always crunching stuff in my head or on paper
5044027 antes de que me mates me gustar a decirte algo humildemente te pido esa posibilidad

5044033 there are two types of opinion that come from veterans wise opinions and bias opinion
5044034 i have two ways to dismiss your stance although i do respect it remember me
5044035 whether its your newborns more hardened appearance the way he now approaches people with guarded skepticism or just that look on his face that says oh wait maybe life isnt all hugs and kisses and rainbows

5044039 but in my view your face is not everything real beauty lies inside a person not outside
5044040 because beauty is all about faces and beautiful girls and skin
5044041 help us bring back a smile to the face of these survivors
5044042 they say that when we come to a beauty salon we come with the expectation that were going to be relaxed in a different frame of mind
5044043 if we come here and we see someone who has gone through so much pain and misery so automatically that gives us that low feeling also they have a point
5044044 at the same time there are clients who take pride in asking these girls to give them a blow dry or getting a manicure or pedicure taken from them
5044045 once we had a wedding in the family i went there and all the girls were getting dressed and putting on makeup so that time i felt a pain in my heart
5044046 but i dont want to weaken myself with these thoughts
5044047 the peace of mind i have now i never had before i suffered much more mental anguish in my married life
5044048 i feel that her hands call me again and again
5044049 when i see them i want to be like them strong girls
5044050 i want to make a name for myself in this profession
5044051 im independent now i stand on my own two feet

5044063 we are not against renewable energy but we are against inappropriate technologies
5044064 this is a very historic area and this is going to be something that will dominate the entire landscape
5044065 we urgently need to change the way we make our energy in the uk
5044066 wind energy is a local resource it grows here in the uk and we can just make our own energy from it and solve both problems
5044067 to most people they are graceful rather beautiful structures that are doing a very important job for us all

5044083 inflation costs have not been addressed by the state funding formulas for three years
5044084 unless the state adjusts the formula well be looking at cutting something
5044085 i believe the finance system needs to be reformed so there is not only an index for inflation which includes gas utilities and insurance costs which are going up for all school districts as well as an ability for the school districts to keep more of their money
5044086 undervalued the assets of the company and potentially would have adversely impacted the groups existing funding arrangement

5044180 you awaken me to delight in your mouth and my lips are restless until theyre kissing you
5044181 there are five ways to prove the existence of a kiss
5044182 kissing is an occasion of lust unless it is the custom of the country
5044183 i conjure you brothers kissing your feet and with the charity of which i am capable to show all reverence and all honor possible to the most holy body and blood of our lord jesus christ in whom the things that are in heaven and on earth are pacified and reconciled to the almighty god
5044184 ah the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that the lord has blessed
5044185 joseph threw himself upon his father and wept over him and
5044186 greet one another with a kiss of love peace to all of you who are in christ
5044187 greet one another with a holy kiss all the churches of christ send greetings
5044188 all the brothers here send you greetings greet one another with a holy
5044189 then jonathan gave his weapons to the boy and said
5044190 he had told rachel that he was a relative of her father and a son of rebekah so she ran and told her father as soon as laban heard the news about jacob his sisters son he hurried to meet him he embraced him and
5044191 so moses went out to meet his father in law and bowed down and
5044192 so all the people crossed the jordan and then the king crossed over the king
5044193 now in the street now in the squares at every corner she lurks she took hold of him and
5044194 then samuel took a flask of oil and poured it on sauls head and
5044195 so joab went to the king and told him this then the king summoned absalom and he came in and bowed down with his face to the ground before the king and the king kissed absalom
5044196 but esau ran to meet jacob and embraced him he threw his arms around his neck and kissed him and they wept
5044197 then he threw his arms around his brother benjamin and wept and benjamin embraced him weeping and he kissed rachel and began to weep aloud
5044198 do you see this woman i came into your house you did not give me any water for my feet but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair you did not give me a kiss but this woman from the time i entered has not stopped
5044199 when he had said this he knelt down with all of them and prayed they all wept as they embraced him and kissed him what grieved them most was his statement that they would never see his face again then they accompanied him to the ship
5044200 if only you were to me like a brother who was nursed at my mothers breasts then if i found you outside i would kiss you and no one would despise me
5044201 let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth for your love is more delightful than wine

5044203 my father and grandfather were farmers and we grew rice on this land for a long time
5044204 the state built roads around the area and it became modernised about 1985 this place was then considered provincial and my family had no choice but to abandon farming
5044205 but we owned the land and soon advertising companies started coming to rent our space for their offices they suggested to me that i should consider doing something with the land maybe build a studio for advertising and film production
5044206 it took me many years to make up my mind i knew nothing about advertising or filming
5044207 but then we realised that this was much bigger than we first thought so i went to get loans from a bank they initially refused because we had no business experience and it took a lot of convincing before they granted us the money
5044208 ive learned everything from our customers fixing one problem and learning something from it i believe that what makes our customers keep coming back is our friendly family style management
5044209 generally the russian forces are starting to move out of the city particularly gori starting to consolidate their positions and get themselves into a position where they can start to back away towards the border
5044210 we see that going on particularly in the areas around the seaports and around tbilisi and up north of tbilisi and west towards gori
5044211 over the last 24 hours really there has been no air activity
5044212 so we see them generally complying and moving back into a position where they can start to make their exit in an orderly fashion
5044213 what we dont want to do is build some sort of mountain of supplies there with no distribution system
5044214 es war wichtig dass wir diesen bann gebrochen haben die mannschaft wollte den sieg unbedingt und hat verdient gewonnen vielleicht war es ein vorteil dass wir durch den uefa cup bereits im rhythmus waren

5044217 did it bother you to be around that baby today
5044218 somehow i feel like you are able to have the pain jealousy and avoidance necessary in your own grief while there is a separated space that you just love me and wish happiness for me even though you dont feel happy by our event it is 100 okay with me if you dont pretend to be excited for the birth or send happy notes of congrats or even read our blog i just hope and pray with all my heart that i not cause you more pain i love you and i want to take away your hurt not intensify it

5044248 when central banks intervene in the currency markets they exchange their currency for dollars central banks then use the dollars they acquire to buy
5044249 on july 16 2008 the federal reserve reported holding 2 349 billion of us government paper in custody for central banks in its report released today this amount had grown over the past three weeks to 2 401 billion a 38 4 annual rate of growth so central banks were accumulating dollars over the past three weeks at a rate far above what one would expect as a result of the us trade deficit the logical conclusion is that they were intervening in currency markets they were buying dollars for the purpose of propping it up to keep the dollar from falling off the edge of the cliff and doing so ignited a short covering rally which is not too difficult to do given the leverage employed in the markets these days by hedge funds and others

5044273 along comes mccain who not only has he doesnt like to talk about his religion very much and then he talks about it openly but he has a very powerful story thats emotionally connected to the audience
5044274 its the candidate who can connect emotionally to middle america who will have the big advantage going down the stretch
5044275 it was far less about religion and a lot more about values
5044276 on this particular issue if you believe that life begins at conception and you are consistent then i cant argue with you on that
5044277 what i can do is say are there ways we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies
5044278 for me as a christian it is a sacred union gods in the mix
5044279 i can afford those civil rights to others even if i dont have that view
5044280 i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5044281 john mccains going to be a much tougher opponent for barack obama in the debates than anybody ever might have imagined just a few weeks ago
5044282 for a minute there we were just two christians worshipping together
5044283 hes a man of few words but when he tells stories he connects
5044284 i thought barack obamas answer tonight was helpful to him and addressed a couple of things because theres been a lot of doubt about his christian faith
5044285 i think he also helped to dispel the myth that hes such an elitist and hes arrogant he was quite humble in that answer and many others
5044286 i dont think he was a strong enough jurist or a legal thinker at the time for that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation
5044287 those are the judges that the evangelicals that social conservative voters want to hear from john mccains own lips that he opposes and that he would not support because the issue of judges is perhaps one of the most if not the most important issue for many social conservatives
5044288 the voters out there who went out in large numbers for george w bush that is one of the things that they want to hear from john mccain because that is something that gives them a lot more faith in john mccain
5044289 that hes not going to make the same mistake another republican president made
5044290 every time he would get to bat it would just blow up but it hasnt this time
5044291 so far the knee is good and well make a decision tomorrow
5044292 im very happy definitely happy and the only thing left is do whatever i can to help the team
5044293 ill just have to try and see what happens but im sure ill be able to help the team
5044294 i had some doubts as far as the surgery but as far as making the decision to try and make it back i had no doubts
5044295 the proof is ive got 60 something games i was healthy the thing is when you dont have the real focus on your job you cant do a good job you know its not like an excuse but if you dont feel comfortable something happens to where you cant do your job i tried to do my best
5044296 he took me out from mexico in 2002 when i played for him with the expos and then he took me to the big leagues he has great confidence in me i want to do a good job for him
5044297 im surprised its a little bit late for a trade
5044298 but for me i passed my best times in this organization
5044299 sometimes guys just have off years i think that happens its a part of the game hes certainly healthy and i think a change of scenery will help him
5044300 i think going to a pennant race will help him
5044301 i cant say enough good things about luis he took the ball for us anytime he was asked and did a phenomenal job his entire career hell be missed
5044302 theyre fighting for first place so im going to do my best to clear my mind and try to help the bullpen
5044303 he attacked the hitters i kind of expect the same thing plus hes experienced thats important
5044304 he had requested to be traded this year throughout the year
5044305 we attempted to do so by the trade deadline and just were not able to make a deal that made sense for us with a month and a half left before free agency we felt we needed to get something for him

5044309 at first glance the conference seems stacked in favor of orthodox bloggers with right wing political leanings
5044310 i think what nefesh bnefesh is doing is deceitful a true jewish bloggers conference would be both open to all jewish bloggers and far more balanced
5044311 who wants to go listen to some carefully hand picked panel discussion where there are exactly equal numbers of right wing left wing girls boys religious secular sephardi ashkenazi theres no end to that kind of madness
5044312 i have the sense the organizers of the conference were going for pro israel pro aliyah bloggers who also get lots of traffic unfortunately that demographic seems to skew somewhat right wing religious just as the actual aliyah statistics do
5044313 im sure they will more than make up for any disparity in numbers with their active participation
5044314 one issue that may not be on the agenda that i would like to see discussed is how to increase our advertising revenue

5044392 i have asked roads service to carry out a full investigation into the underpass flooding
5044393 the contractors are still working here and we will want to be talking to them to ascertain how it became flooded and why it didnt clear itself quickly as well as to make sure that this sort of thing doesnt happen in future
5044394 as a result northern ireland water was able to deploy resources and contractors throughout the event and around the clock

5044423 there was nothing we could do but make the best of it
5044424 i dont ever want to deal with a storm like that again believe me it will change your attitude for the worse

5044426 we defer to the prosecutor and we have every confidence that he will take the best and most appropriate course

5044430 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
5044431 you have value on the ground more than you spent
5044432 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
5044433 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
5044434 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5044435 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5044436 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5044437 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5044438 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5044439 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5044440 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5044441 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5044442 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5044443 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5044444 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5044445 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5044446 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5044447 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5044448 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
5044449 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5044450 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5044451 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5044452 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5044453 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5044454 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5044455 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5044456 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5044457 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5044458 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5044459 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5044460 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5044461 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5044462 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5044463 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5044464 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5044465 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5044466 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5044467 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5044468 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5044469 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5044470 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5044471 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5044472 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5044473 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5044474 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5044475 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5044476 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5044477 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5044478 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5044479 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5044480 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5044481 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5044482 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5044483 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5044484 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5044485 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5044486 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5044487 real time exper e value or as a source of income
5044488 your cars not starting right your battery may be going out
5044489 your cars not starting right your battery may be going out
5044490 your cars not starting right your battery may be going out
5044491 your cars not starting right your battery may be going out
5044492 it was really hard to go back into the gym after what happened but i kept training
5044493 in the past campaigns have collected more than contribution limits allowed
5044494 we will be complying with the law i cant tell you if we will be returning the money to the people or not the law is not actually clear we have tried to clearly understand the intent of the law
5044495 its the most frustrating because it takes time away from the heart of the campaign and what vermonters want
5044496 the biggest impact it will have on the campaign is diverting time resources from educating voters and having events where they want to learn about new opportunities
5044497 we defer to the prosecutor and we have every confidence that he will take the best and most appropriate course
5044498 do i win a empty paperbag or something of that sort
5044499 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
5044500 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
5044501 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
5044502 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
5044503 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground
5044504 i truly believe that the florida division of elections every decision that came from their office favored bush

5044507 theres nothing like taking a nice quiet bomb apart to steady the nerves
5044508 a couple of u s stock funds or even just one a total stock market index fund plus a foreign stock fund and a bond fund are all most people need to cover the bases
5044509 if you have more then eight funds you should slap yourself
5044510 how many funds should you have four to six should do
5044511 as a general rule of thumb the more complexity that exists in a wall street cration the faster and farther investors should run
5044512 it does not take much to outperform the average investor all you have to do is put half your money in the vangurd total stock market and the other half in an intermediate term bond fund
5044513 oh by the way i also receive a 100k yr pension paid medical etc

5044520 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
5044521 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
5044522 are you there wake up buddy ive got some bad news
5044523 yeah han its me you said something about bad news
5044524 the empire is here i had spotted at least three imperial shuttles landing somewhere in the city

5044533 this is the imperial shuttle rancon conveying lord rasche to worlport we request permission to land on the first available landing pad
5044534 i want patrols to search every hotel for senator dahlma and her aide igraine colbert
5044535 and arrest anyone who has been seen in their company
5044536 have there been any reports of large gatherings at any of the hotels or other public buildings in the past two days
5044537 my lord ord mantell is a haven for smugglers and such the citizens here do not keep records of such meetings at least not on a regular basis the most extensive record you would find are the guests at the hotels and the starships that arrive at the spaceports of all the major cities and resorts and even their records are not completely concise
5044538 this woman was found with several grenades lord rasche concussion grenades
5044539 it seems we have a terrorist on our hands where did you find her
5044540 who are you where is your identification and what exactly were you planning to do with those grenades
5044541 nothing its personal they have nothing to do with you
5044542 all right if you must know i wanted revenge i
5044543 i had a a little brush with the law yesterday me and my friends
5044544 i would say that your friends got what they had deserved
5044545 well yeah shes the shes the woman we i mean my friends tried to mug her some spacer came to her resuce
5044546 i think they had known each other in fact i think she was a passenger of his
5044547 because i had spotted them last night and i followed them
5044548 the only favor you will receive from me is your life now where did miss colbert and this pilot go
5044549 the spacers ship is located inside a hangar on volange street its a corellian freighter
5044550 a corellian freighter had been seen leaving maldare two days ago
5044551 turn her over to the authorities if her information proves to be correct i will order her release
5044552 too bad the prisoner did not know which hotel the senator was staying

5044569 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
5044570 i dont need no stinkin benchmark because i only use index funds so my portfolio is the benchmark
5044571 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
5044572 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
5044573 each mutual fund you invest in should have its own benchmark even if it is an index fund and your portfolio should be an appropriate fixed mix of those benchmarks the benchmarks should all be capitalization weighted indexes that represent the investable universe in that asset class
5044574 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
5044575 t he option should exist to invest in the benchmark as an alternative to the portfolio under consideration
5044576 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
5044577 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
5044578 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
5044579 absolute return portfolio produced an annualized 13 1 percent exceeding the passive benchmark of the
5044580 absolute return portfolio produced an annualized 13 1 percent exceeding the passive benchmark of the
5044581 as sort of a clearing house for proper portfolios benchmarking
5044582 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
5044583 that problem is pretty easily solved by calculating a portfolios time weighted return rather than irr or dollar weighted return and comparing the twr to the benchmark return twr removes the impact of cash flows on portfolio performance
5044584 you bring up a major issue with performance measurement cash flows in a portfolio are handled differently than cash flows in an index so there will always be some irr tracking error in between the portfolio and the index in an index it is assumed that the dividend is paid on the ex dividend date and reinvested in the index however in a portfolio the divided does not come in until the dividend payment date and then it might take another day or so to reinvest so by default using irr the portfolio cannot match the irr of the index
5044585 for example if you start with 10 000 and then add 1 00 000 during a year there is a twr return calculation from the 10 000 contribution to the date the 1 000 000 was added then there is second calculation starting the day of the 1 000 000 contribution
5044586 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
5044587 the whole point of calculating the portfolio twr is to remove the effect of cash flows on performance thereby making a comparison to a benchmark relevent the benchmark returns do not have any cash flows associated with them and neither does the portfolios twr so its an apples to apples comparison
5044588 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
5044589 say you had 10 000 at the beginning of the year and your investments did great in the first 3 months your 10 000 turned into 12 000 without you adding a penny now on april 1 you put in 20 000 more but your investments stalled in the rest of the year and you end the year with 32 000 so you made 20 on 10 000 in the first 3 months and you made 0 on 32 000 in the next 9 months if you plug in these values in a spreadsheet and use the xirr function you get 8 this makes sense because 10000 1 8 1 4 10194 10194 20000 1 8 3 4 31988 pretty close except for rounding if you didnt put in additional 20 000 on april 1 your return wouldve been 20 thats how your investment choices did and thats how fidelity or schwab will report to you theres a big difference between the 8 dollar weighted rate of return and the 20 time weighted rate of return because the cash flow in this example is unusually large if we change the additional contribution on april 1 from 20 000 to 1 000 and have the end of year value at 13 000 instead of 32 000 the two returns would be much closer the dollar weighted rate of return would be 18 6 and the time weighted rate of return would still be 20
5044590 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
5044591 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter

5044642 in the summer of 2007 as arctic sea ice reached a record low the northwest passage opened between baffin bay and mcclure strait also known as mclure strait passing through parry channel this opening would be the route through the arctic most conducive to large scale shipping as of early august 2008 arctic sea ice was not expected to set a new melt record although its extent was well below the long term average whether the northwest passage would open as far north as it did the previous year remained in question but the sea ice in a more southerly route one taken by norwegian explorer roald amundsen in the early twentieth century had begun to melt

5044645 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
5044646 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years

5044729 doszedlem do wniosku ze najbardziej konkretna rzecza we wszechswiecie jest informacja
5044730 wszystkie procesy niewazne czy powstaja poprzez ludzki wysilek czy spontanicznie moga byc postrzegane jako proces obliczeniowy
5044731 zarowno twoj umysl do przetworzenia mysli i wszechswiat do przetworzenia zachowania sie czasteczki wody w filizance potrzebuja tych samych uniwersalnych wszechobecnych wlasciwosci wszechswiata stalych fizycznych lub inaczej procesow obliczeniowych zlozonych z zer i jedynek
5044732 uniwersalnosc procesow obliczeniowych to jedna z najwazniejszych rzeczy we wszechswiecie
5044733 wszechswiat nie jest programem dzialajacym na czyims innym komputerze to jest uniwersalny komputer i nie ma nic poza nim
5044734 natura przeprowadzala procesy obliczeniowe posuwajac naprzod rozwoj wszechswiata przez miliardy lat wszystko co musimy zrobic i wlasciwie wszystko co mozemy zrobic to przylaczyc sie do tego wielkiego kosmicznego procesu obliczeniowego
5044735 jesli wszechswiat jest komputerem to jaka ma on moc obliczeniowa
5044736 poprzez analize potencjalu obliczeniowego czastek elementarnych lloyd obliczyl gorny limit ilosci obliczen ktore caly wszechswiat w formie jaka znamy obecnie wykonal od poczatku czasu jest to duza liczba
5044737 potrzebujemy 300 podwojen mocy obliczeniowej przewidzianej przez prawo moores albo 600 lat z jednym podwojeniem mocy co dwa lata zanim cala dostepna energia we wszechswiecie bedzie uzyta do przeprowadzania procesow obliczeniowych przez nasze komputery oczywiscie jezeli przyjmiemy teorie ze wszechswiat juz teraz przeprowadza procesy obliczeniowe to nie musimy czekac wogole w tym przypadku mozemy wlasciwie czekac 600 lat az wszechswiat zacznie pracowac na windowsie lub linuksie
5044738 na koncu cala przestrzen i jej zawartosc bedzie komputerem wszechswiat na koncu bedzie sie skladal doslownie z inteligentnego procesu myslowego
5044739 na poczatku bylo slowo i slowo bylo z bogiem slowo bylo bogiem
5044740 informacja ma niemal mistyczny charakter poniewaz zdaje sie miec pewien gleboki zwiazek z podstawowym porzadkiem wszechswiata jaki dokladnie jest ten zwiazek niewiadomo przynajmniej narazie
5044741 jezeli wszechswiat dziala jak komputer jaki sens mialoby twierdzenie ze nie jest on komputerem

5044746 shame on us if the brooke bennett tragedy doesnt lead to improvements in our laws and policies in the sex crimes area
5044747 with the safety of our children at stake it is clear that an outside body must conduct a full investigation of every aspect of this case and our parole system to determine how this failure occurred
5044748 mean more trials more victims that go through trials and probably result in less convictions because the iffy cases we have right now where weve got problems we usually bargain them down
5044749 victims rights advocates and prosecutors tell us would result in more harm
5044750 we defer to the prosecutor and we have every confidence that he will take the best and most appropriate course

5044752 thats amazing because its the longest memory anyones ever demonstrated
5044753 these are some of the most potent antibodies ever isolated against a virus
5044754 the lessons we are learning about the 1918 flu tell us a lot about what may happen during a future pandemic
5044755 this is the first time anyone has done really fundamental hands on quantum mechanics with an organic led
5044756 we can convert the spin information into a current and manipulate it and change it
5044757 we are manipulating this information and reading it out again we are writing it and reading it
5044758 even the smallest transistor today consists of hundreds of thousands of atoms
5044759 the ultimate goal of miniaturization is to implement electronics on the scale of atoms and electrons
5044760 just like a mass on a spring the pulse produces an oscillation of the spins of singlets and triplets in the organic led
5044761 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
5044762 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
5044763 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both

5044765 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
5044766 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
5044767 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5044768 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5044769 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5044770 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5044771 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5044772 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5044773 many in the christian right tend to get their information

5044778 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
5044779 recycling is recycling glass should be included its not about making money its about making difference
5044780 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5044781 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5044782 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5044783 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5044784 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5044785 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5044786 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
5044787 huge sigh of relief on the part of the voters
5044788 when we had pick a party my office and county auditors received a huge amount of complaints and gripes
5044789 we are hearing nothing which is an indication that people are satisfied its been a remarkable change
5044790 reduces the value of information of who is a democrat and who is a republican
5044791 it will be the beginning of the end of her campaign
5044792 not a few men are sexually aroused to erection by observing women walk with obvious distress in tight shoes
5044793 theres a combination of reality and voyeurism that captures the imagination
5044794 if katie was this entertaining when she was actually on the air i might even watch her little newscast
5044795 its nice to be on harry shearer im gonna get you
5044796 a eternidade mora no fundo das guas no fundo do tempo
5044797 e foi a tarde e a manh do primeiro dia
5044798 is also designed to be heard in a shuffle free world from start to finish
5044799 the events in georgia have shown how dangerous the world is becoming and the idea that the us can even think of siting missiles and soldiers in poland without antagonising russia is at best wishful thinking and at worst deliberately provocative
5044800 there could not be a worse time to escalate tensions further russia has been extremely concerned over the development of missile defence in central europe fearing that it is the target the rejection by the us of russian offers to co operate with it only serves to compound this fear
5044801 if we want peace we must stop this western interference
5044802 we must also be aware of the connections between the us raising tensions the wars in afghanistan and iraq and its war on terror all these are part of a strategic attempt by the us to impose its power and control over increasing parts of the world
5044803 the rapid expansion of nato including within the former soviet union together with this missile defence expansion has set alarm bells ringing in moscow

5044806 to win the champions league the premier league we need more than this
5044807 i said to anelka today you have three or four chances and you have to make one or two goals for me and for the people because i want the people to believe in you
5044808 today they played very well its important but more important is that the fans of chelsea saw a beautiful game
5044809 i bought two strikers and maybe i made a rod for my own back because you cant play 4 4 2 here unless you play 4 5 1 you get overloaded theyre just too good
5044810 the goal was to start sectarian violence with the car bombs
5044811 there used to be a whole brigade here and now its less soon these policies will backfire in tal afar and allow terrorists to come in
5044812 we used to depend mostly on coalition forces but unfortunately the footprint of the u s has been reduced
5044813 frankly we dont trust the iraqi police one hundred percent
5044814 when the aug 8 bomb went off in tal afar the police joined with the civilians to attack sunnis when we didnt join the fight they called us terrorists
5044815 as the iraqi units stood up over the past 18 months they took over our bases
5044816 we confirmed that they could operate in company and battalion strength
5044817 watch out now take care beware of greedy leaders who take you where you should not go while weeping at the cedars in the dead of night
5044818 we love you but well hate you if you leave
5044819 with the problems associated with contaminated heparin produced from pig tissues in china a non animal source of this essential drug is gaining importance
5044820 a safer version of the drug could result in less adverse effects and fewer deaths
5044821 if heparin is prepared the right way it should be consistent and safe even from an animal source
5044822 our biotech version of heparin will be prepared in a controlled environment ensuring that it is pure and free of contaminants
5044823 things are good make sure chris keeps his hands to himself
5044824 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5044825 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5044826 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5044827 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5044828 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5044829 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5044830 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
5044831 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
5044832 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power

5044836 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
5044837 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
5044838 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
5044839 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
5044840 cest un score qui refl te bien la physionomie du match nous avons eu trois opportunit s eux aussi il faut retrouver du rythme
5044841 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
5044842 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
5044843 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
5044844 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
5044845 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war

5044848 it would look horrible when people come to take a walk
5044849 they would see the trash and probably throw their own coffee cup in too
5044850 it would look horrible when people come to take a walk
5044851 they would see the trash and probably throw their own coffee cup in too
5044852 the players are going to love the course its one of the premier courses in the land its spectacular
5044853 the players are going to love the course its one of the premier courses in the land its spectacular
5044854 and hed be like man the pizza is good today
5044855 i just wanted to make sure i took every single moment in and every single swim in every single moment with my teammates so i would remember them
5044856 to swim in the same era as him has been awesome
5044857 weve been talking about mark spitz for 36 years now
5044858 i dont know if im going to be alive when they stop talking about this bloke you wonder if we are going to see someone as good as this again
5044859 being able to have something like that to shoot for it made those days when i was tired and i didnt want to be there
5044860 im just thankful for him having done what he did
5044861 the sport of swimming has come a long way so far and i think it can go even further
5044862 mike is opening a lot of doors with what hes doing
5044863 i just want to lay in my own bed for five minutes at least and just relax
5044864 one of the things im really looking forward to is getting back to baltimore
5044865 hes more naturally suited for longer distances itll be change for him but i think itll be a good one
5044866 when we train every day sometimes there are workouts you dont like dont want to do bob says youre putting money in the bank
5044867 i guess i put a lot of money in the bank over the last four years and we withdrew pretty much every penny in the bank after bob and i both grab a little break itll be time to start depositing
5044868 mccains personal fortune traces back to organized crime in arizona
5044869 you got to take care of this to move on
5044870 you cant look at this game and think we played well and were going to move on its about what we do in two days
5044871 they hit a lot of 3s and love to drive and kickout for the open shot
5044872 i just happen to be in the right place at the right time
5044873 i actually thought that i missed a lot of shots early that i usually hit
5044874 i think most of us grew up watching these girls i think i was 10 years old when lisa leslie played in her first olympics it was a good experience i think we played pretty well all things considered
5044875 im surprised its a little bit late for a trade
5044876 but for me i passed my best times in this organization
5044877 sometimes guys just have off years i think that happens its a part of the game hes certainly healthy and i think a change of scenery will help him
5044878 i think going to a pennant race will help him
5044879 i cant say enough good things about luis he took the ball for us anytime he was asked and did a phenomenal job his entire career hell be missed
5044880 theyre fighting for first place so im going to do my best to clear my mind and try to help the bullpen
5044881 he attacked the hitters i kind of expect the same thing plus hes experienced thats important
5044882 he had requested to be traded this year throughout the year
5044883 we attempted to do so by the trade deadline and just were not able to make a deal that made sense for us with a month and a half left before free agency we felt we needed to get something for him
5044884 were not ready to play the season yet and thats evident
5044885 its a technical issue with the rudder that will be rectified overnight
5044886 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
5044887 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
5044888 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
5044889 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
5044890 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
5044891 just so you all know we did set a record
5044892 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
5044893 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
5044894 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
5044895 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
5044896 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
5044897 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
5044898 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
5044899 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
5044900 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
5044901 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
5044902 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
5044903 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
5044904 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
5044905 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
5044906 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
5044907 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
5044908 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
5044909 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
5044910 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
5044911 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
5044912 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
5044913 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
5044914 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
5044915 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
5044916 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
5044917 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
5044918 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
5044919 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
5044920 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
5044921 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
5044922 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
5044923 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
5044924 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
5044925 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
5044926 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
5044927 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
5044928 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
5044929 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
5044930 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
5044931 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
5044932 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
5044933 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
5044934 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5044935 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5044936 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5044937 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5044938 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5044939 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5044940 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5044941 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5044942 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
5044943 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
5044944 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
5044945 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
5044946 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
5044947 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
5044948 estoy en una dimensi n paralela no puede ser real
5044949 eu me sinto bem foi um grande jogo come ar com vit ria importante
5044950 como n o conquistamos nada no ano passado nesta temporada n s vamos realmente determinados e acho que n s mostramos isto hoje
5044951 calcitriol sends the fat cells a message to start making more fat and sends another message to slow down the process of fat breakdown and oxidation
5044952 if you eat a higher protein diet with high levels of leucine coming from dairy products during weight loss youll lose 80 percent body fat as opposed to the usual 60 percent body fat
5044953 the records not finished its supposed to be me and
5044954 its fun being creative and even if you have a concept in your head to write about you can write it and give it to someone else because it might not personally fit you but it might be an idea you have
5044955 so with rihanna that was an idea i had i just wanted to go totally left and kind of weird and thats what i threw at her
5044956 de parken investeren voorlopig vooral in meer kindvriendelijke attracties of meer aanbod voor de groeiende groep actieve opas en omas
5044957 je moet daarbij denken aan meer theatershows maar ook uitbreiding van winkelmogelijkheden en het aanbod van lekker eten niet langer alleen een hamburger en patat maar ook gezond voedsel
5044958 de extra investering loopt al snel in de tientallen miljoenen maar daar krijg je geen miljoenen bezoekers extra voor terug parken wachten dus langer met een dergelijke nieuwe aankoop
5044959 we worden ook in een beginstadium al betrokken bij nieuwe plannen en ik kan wel zeggen dat er momenteel niets in de pijplijn zit het zijn nu vooral investeringen in attracties voor kleinere kinderen
5044960 als je de hoogste achtbaan net af hebt is er een paar maanden later altijd wel weer een park dat net een halve meter meer bouwde je moet iets bieden wat niemand heeft en dat zit meer in de thematische sfeer
5044961 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop
5044962 it was magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 percent wide open
5044963 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5044964 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5044965 we historically dont make our decisions within a 24 hour period it takes time to get everybody in a group and talk about it
5044966 let me just say that first and foremost that that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys there at jgr
5044967 i want to apologize to nascar to our partners to toyota guys a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5044968 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were
5044969 for us we kind of feel like in the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and chief engine builder mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5044970 i can tell you that our electric bill has virtually doubled in almost five years
5044971 allows us to recover the costs during some very expensive power periods
5044972 really not driven by demand on the system its fuel prices
5044973 weve just found that given the current energy market and where energys going weve had a number of customers that have said theyd like to participate in those programs
5044974 get paid an up front credit against their bill to allow us to have the option to call those
5044975 we would be talking about shutting down building systems that would not keep an employee from being in their labs or their offices youre talking strictly about a comfort issue not a productivity issue
5044976 my speculation is tva looked at these interruptible programs and they dont make a lot of economic sense i think thats why theyre trying to eliminate those
5044977 passed along to the consumers of our products which are students patients
5044978 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
5044979 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
5044980 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
5044981 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
5044982 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
5044983 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
5044984 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
5044985 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
5044986 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
5044987 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5044988 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5044989 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5044990 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5044991 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5044992 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5044993 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5044994 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5044995 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5044996 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5044997 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5044998 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5044999 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5045000 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5045001 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5045002 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5045003 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5045004 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5045005 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5045006 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5045007 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5045008 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5045009 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5045010 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5045011 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5045012 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5045013 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5045014 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5045015 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5045016 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5045017 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5045018 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
5045019 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
5045020 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
5045021 its certainly our most successful day in olympic games history not just the fact weve got five medals but that theyre across three different sports
5045022 weve already equalled our athens haul and theres still a week to go with the potential optimistically to double that
5045023 i got home about half past one or quarter to two and to have to a whole bunch of kiwis outside our whanau house was pretty awesome
5045024 it was so late but they were still waiting up for me
5045025 still waiting for someone to tap me on and the shoulder and tell me it was a big dream it hasnt sunk in yet
5045026 it will be a pleasant surprise for a lot of kiwis it has always been difficult to bring savings back but this agreement will make it much easier
5045027 to have that level of open support from australia is an extremely positive step
5045028 i think tonights match was one of the best ive played in my career
5045029 before the games i had many sleepless nights now i can sleep well
5045030 lin dan played very well and there was no chance for him to lose tonight
5045031 the second launch of the safir rocket carrying the first satellite omid was conducted successfully
5045032 the achievement has drawn much attention from around the world especially from among muslim nations as iran is under heavy sanctions by the west and the un security council making it develop the technology and build every part and equipment needed in the field of aerospace
5045033 this satellite the rocket and the launch station are entirely iranian built achieved by particularly talented scientists and technicians
5045034 best life is cabrio drive because the sky is the limit
5045035 ter sido criado por esse homem me fez t o bem e ao mesmo tempo me fez t o mal o brasil n o poderia ter perdido dorival caymmi jorge amado guimar es rosa o pa s n o precisa disso eu queria que ele dorival me levasse ao cemit rio eu sei que ele iria sofrer mas esses brasileiros n o mereciam que ele morresse

5045038 no matter how much a person may love you youll find no one who would die for you like jesus did
5045039 we were surprised how tame the contents were in those
5045040 so they had a lot of respect for beryllium contamination even back then
5045041 i told them it was a private party and to clear off but this big youth put his face right into mine and said make me
5045042 as i tackled him six of them came over the top of me i received a big hit to the side of my head
5045043 all i would suggest if a situation arises again leave it to the police to handle
5045044 here here now trashing someones house thats not nice whats your name son
5045045 oh now youre smart mouthing the wrong copper mlad im well up on the heywood jablowme prank can only fool me so many times with that one so you wont give me your name huh well ill show you you have no identity and thus youre free to go
5045046 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
5045047 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
5045048 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
5045049 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
5045050 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
5045051 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
5045052 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
5045053 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
5045054 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
5045055 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
5045056 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
5045057 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
5045058 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
5045059 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
5045060 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
5045061 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
5045062 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
5045063 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
5045064 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
5045065 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
5045066 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
5045067 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
5045068 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
5045069 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
5045070 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
5045071 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
5045072 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
5045073 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
5045074 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
5045075 i had a little bit of hope inside of me
5045076 but seeing how beautifully she executed her routine i knew
5045077 after the all around i was excited to have made the floor finals and a bronze medal feels great
5045078 today i concentrated only on my moves not the medals
5045079 i felt that i had a very normal performance without surprises and that is why i got a silver medal
5045080 im disappointed especially since third place had a fall and i made both of mine
5045081 i cant change her score the judges made up their minds
5045082 i definitely had to pull myself together a little bit the last few days
5045083 im sure someday ill appreciate what i did i still have to get to that step
5045084 it is amazing to go to three olympics and get three medals
5045085 i was nervous when i was watching the other gymnasts competing after me
5045086 this is a competition so two or three mistakes are pretty common i was struggling during those 10 minutes i was worried that i wouldnt get the gold medal
5045087 today we suffered a lot but it has been superb it has been years that we have worked for this ever since athens 2004 i have been dreaming of this gold medal
5045088 first of all a break because it was not easy winning this gold medal here in beijing
5045089 it was totally different today i was able to change the game plan a bit against zach and sail my own race a little more so im very happy to have won it
5045090 the goal was to win gold and with the conditions being stronger it was easier for me to go out and use my speed and my fitness
5045091 i picked up the silver medal and it all came out like i hoped
5045092 when we crossed the line the of three of us just looked at each other
5045093 you just know that youre the best in the world at what you do
5045094 this is my first olympic medal but it is a pity that we didnt beat britain
5045095 ive done what i said i was going to do i knew it was going to be the toughest race of my life i hope im not going to wake up
5045096 its great to be one of the top two in the world
5045097 i was lying in bed when peter phoned me and asked if i could ride
5045098 for us to get this kind of result today comes from our four years of preparations
5045099 we told the athletes that we were fighting for the gold medal we werent defending it
5045100 china is the best team so for us to beat all the other teams i think we accomplished what we set out to do
5045101 even though i lost that first game i think in the end i did ok i had the right tactics beginning with that second game it went a lot more smoothly
5045102 i am going to georgia this weekend to get the facts first hand and to show my support for georgias people and its democratically elected government
5045103 i struggled on the back nine i got a little bit stressed after the two bogeys but i started pretty well
5045104 for me it has been difficult to get that second title its been a long wait
5045105 just to be able to get the top seed and not have to face the americans till the gold medal game is huge
5045106 we just knew we had to buckle down on defense and get stops to fuel our offense
5045107 when i was placed on the national team for the olympic games i did not set too high a goal i only wanted for the people to get to know me
5045108 when you are the olympic champion you did your job very well perfect
5045109 i was thinking how to perform on my own side
5045110 i wanted to help the chinese people know and appreciate the sport so i was trying to do my best
5045111 ive been training hard with her the last four years
5045112 i think i can do it because ive been training with her i told chiharu the gold medal is for her too

5045152 i didnt think ollie would get to it said south bend manager mark haley
5045153 he has good instincts and is very knowledgeable when it comes to reading the ball off the bat he can really turn on the afterburners ive seen him do that then have to stop and wait for the ball
5045154 were going to see a lot of each other so we move on to a new day
5045155 we got off to another slow start and that seems to be the trend with us lately
5045156 we battled back a couple times closed the gap but it was a tough one and thats the way it goes sometimes weve got to regroup
5045157 we should end the war in iraq as soon as possible
5045158 weve spent almost seven years and hundreds of lives searching for bin ladin weve killed thousands of afghanis and mr bin ladins voice is still heard regularly on the airwaves its time for a better approach than boots wandering the desert
5045159 every future generation will be buried under the debt burden were creating today that debt creates spiralling oil prices a pathetic balance of payments deficit and increasing unemployment
5045160 mccain wants 100 years of occupation obama wants a bigger army look at the national debt america cant afford mccain obama and their endless military deficit spending
5045161 george bush may claim bin ladin hates us for our freedoms
5045162 but bushs totally wrong war is destroying those freedoms from warrantless wiretaps to the guantanamo bay prison camps the bush republican war party and its democratic party allies are destroying the liberties guaranteed by our constitution and bill of rights if you want to save america theres only one choice this november the libertarian choice
5045163 its not the way i imagined it to feel but its magic
5045164 its pretty incredible im so proud of myself if it were easy so many people would have done it already i wanted a gold i wanted to be a champion now ive put my mark down to be remembered

5045167 its the best i could do today considering i did two pursuits in qualifying yesterday i couldnt go faster i did my best and i have to make peace with that

5045170 the match has struck the fuse has been lit and four or five years from now opec producers are going to be drinking their own oil and choking on it
5045171 you had a perfect storm of pre olympics demand in china a plunging dollar speculation cold weather and fear of supply disruptions in nigeria and iran pushing it up and now theyve all swung around on a dime
5045172 people who dont trade the futures markets dont realize that this is typical for commodities which always trade on emotion look at silver in the late 1970s which went from 4 to 50 and back to 4 in two years
5045173 everyone who keeps kosher will tell you that his version is the only correct version everyone else is either a fanatic or a heretic

5045175 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
5045176 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
5045177 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
5045178 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
5045179 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
5045180 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
5045181 pakistan lacks any institutional checks that could help maintain oversight over isi operations
5045182 the russian troops are starting to pull out and russian peacekeepers are coming in
5045183 this is just a redeployment they have pulled out from their bases but they are still all over the place you can see that
5045184 russia overreached used disproportionate force against a small neighbour and is now paying the price for that because russia s reputation as a potential partner in international institutions diplomatic political security economic is in tatters

5045186 i don t know why i went ahead with it i didn t love shafiq and i didn t really want him i was just stupid and naive
5045187 shafiq was in scotland on a six month visa but had over stayed for three years last june the authorities discovered that he was staying illegally

5045192 i would have become the prime minister if i wished to become president
5045193 if he doesn t resign it will be one more mistake by him he knows the government has enough numbers to vote him out in case of impeachment
5045194 impeachment and other affairs were discussed it was in mr musharraf s mind that impeachment motion could be challenged in supreme court but i told him that it could not be challenged in apex court because parliament is supreme
5045195 he musharraf is ready to resign but he is putting conditions like indemnity for the november 3 action
5045196 back door talks are still on things have not yet been finalised let s see what happens
5045197 that s not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
5045198 a roadside bomb struck a police vehicle there were 10 policemen in the car who were all killed
5045199 in hindsight we probably didnt have to give him up to get pau
5045200 just send in your questions and lets see who will reply you
5045201 yeah well the chinese are lying but its harmless and weve lied too so has everyone
5045202 review the circumstances around the incident including planning controlling and monitoring of activities inside the containment as well as equipment problems
5045203 a portion of the blowdown pipe is insulated but this damaged section had apparently never had insulation installed
5045204 i just dont want to be followed around new york city like an animal
5045205 if somethings not right i guarantee 20 of the people on this street right are in a relationship they wish they could get out of but they dont know how
5045206 the administration absolutely was telling him not to provoke the russians and to resolve the dispute peacefully
5045207 and then just a month ago you had secretary rice in tbilisi standing next to saakashvili saying in response to a question from him
5045208 and its clear that she had something else in mind she was talking about the dispute with our allies over joining nato but this very open ended statement on her part i think cannot but have created some opportunities for misunderstanding let me put it that way
5045209 well i want to go back to the question about american the american voice here i think hes absolutely right america wasnt speaking with a single clear voice
5045210 we had lower level state department officials giving a correct message but it was confused and it was overridden by a louder voice from washington that came particularly from the neocon community i think we see tragic consequences from that
5045211 it all confirms our numerous warnings addressed to the international community that it is necessary to pay attention to massive arms purchasing by georgia during several years now we see how these arms and georgian special troops who had been trained by foreign specialists are used
5045212 he has had a terrible spell with injury we are all disappointed for him but he will have to come back again
5045213 he did really well in pre season and i picked him to start against villa on merit because of that
5045214 ein spiel zu diesem zeitpunkt ist immer schwierig aber wir m ssen versuchen schnell in die saison und den neuen wettbewerb reinzukommen
5045215 doch wenn einer auf dem platz steht verlangen wir ein temporeiches spiel
5045216 es kann sich ja einer ganz schnell etablieren wenn er seine chance konsequent nutzt und fu im team fasst
5045217 f r unsere spieler ist spielpraxis nat rlich ganz wichtig
5045218 ich wei dass j rgen versucht neue wege zu gehen und einzelne spieler zu f rdern er wird dem deutschen fu ball guttun
5045219 i think hes nice and i think hes sincere in what he says
5045220 im probably the only person in this town that does
5045221 i told him the ball he hit would have been out in fenway
5045222 we had a lot of fun with it a lot of laughs it was a great moment in sports it was an exciting time for that season and for the game of baseball in general
5045223 it was a great rivalry back then but you really dont get a chance to know them like you do now its a lot of fun
5045224 youre not going to see me in six kayaks or canoes with the yankees
5045225 but its not the same edge as before theres not a load of testosterone in this building right now
5045226 i never did it bothered me when we lost some key games to them but i respected the team and the organization and i loved playing at yankee stadium obviously some of my teammates felt a little differently
5045227 over 30 years you realize these are great players great guys its fun to be around them now in a more casual atmosphere
5045228 o indie surgiu nos anos tal e tal as bandas tal e tal foram os expoentes do movimento

5045230 and hed be like man the pizza is good today
5045231 i just wanted to make sure i took every single moment in and every single swim in every single moment with my teammates so i would remember them
5045232 to swim in the same era as him has been awesome
5045233 weve been talking about mark spitz for 36 years now
5045234 i dont know if im going to be alive when they stop talking about this bloke you wonder if we are going to see someone as good as this again
5045235 being able to have something like that to shoot for it made those days when i was tired and i didnt want to be there
5045236 im just thankful for him having done what he did
5045237 the sport of swimming has come a long way so far and i think it can go even further
5045238 mike is opening a lot of doors with what hes doing
5045239 i just want to lay in my own bed for five minutes at least and just relax
5045240 one of the things im really looking forward to is getting back to baltimore
5045241 hes more naturally suited for longer distances itll be change for him but i think itll be a good one
5045242 when we train every day sometimes there are workouts you dont like dont want to do bob says youre putting money in the bank
5045243 que ce soit clair pour tout le monde le pr sident musharraf ne va pas d missionner point
5045244 we played well in the first half and their goalkeeper made several good saves to keep them in the match
5045245 our attacking play in the first half was good but as soon as we lost ryan giggs to a hamstring injury and michael carrick with an ankle which is swollen up badly hell be out for two to three weeks we lost a bit of our experience in midfield
5045246 we ended up having to push patrice evra out to the left side of midfield and he is obviously not our best attacking player being a left back
5045247 newcastle were good on the counter attack and in martins and damien duff they have players with quality in these positions if you dont stop them they can be dangerous
5045248 we had possession of the ball but didnt make it count at times but in light of the people we had missing it was a creditable result for us

5045273 potentialul pietei este foarte mare deoarece consumul de orez in romania este de 100 000 de tone anual cu siguranta piata romaneasca se va consolida in urmatorii doi sau trei ani si valoarea ei va creste pana acum piata orezului era invadata de produse importate de calitate joasa la preturi mici fiindca pentru majoritatea oamenilor orezul era considerat mancarea saracului romania are conditii foarte bune pentru producerea orezului clima este calda exista surse de apa conditiile prielnice pentru cultivarea orezului orezul produs in romania este de o calitate net superioara celui importat din egipt

5045297 we used to depend mostly on coalition forces but unfortunately the footprint of the u s has been reduced
5045298 frankly we dont trust the iraqi police one hundred percent
5045299 when the aug 8 bomb went off in tal afar the police joined with the civilians to attack sunnis when we didnt join the fight they called us terrorists

5045305 they say that when we come to a beauty salon we come with the expectation that were going to be relaxed in a different frame of mind
5045306 if we come here and we see someone who has gone through so much pain and misery so automatically that gives us that low feeling also they have a point
5045307 at the same time there are clients who take pride in asking these girls to give them a blow dry or getting a manicure or pedicure taken from them
5045308 once we had a wedding in the family i went there and all the girls were getting dressed and putting on makeup so that time i felt a pain in my heart

5045325 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5045326 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5045397 deporting christians for worshipping in their private homes shows that king abdullahs speech is mere rhetoric and his country is deceiving the international community about their desire for change and reconciliation
5045398 the mere fact that rabbis would be openly invited to the kingdom a country where in principle jews are not permitted to visit would have constituted a turning point

5045412 we knew that there was a really bad version of the film when i first heard the idea for it i thought this isnt going to be good
5045413 judd had a kind of loose idea for a weed action movie we thought thats a strange notion then we kind of realized there hadnt really been a weed movie that was that good and actually functioned as a real movie so we thought wouldnt it be nice if there was a really good weed movie better yet an action packed weed movie and we kind of just went from there
5045414 they really didnt want to write a sequel and so the compromise is to do a superbad pineapple express crossover an unprecedented crossover movie with two directors greg motolla and david gordon green each directing half of the movie and somehow getting these characters together which doesnt make sense at all but could work im guessing that saul could sell the superbad characters something and the kids could get into some trouble and wed help them out of it seth plays characters in both movies so somehow wed have to kill one of them off

5045426 official legislative documents released this week show that obama in fact presided over a committee hearing where
5045427 there are major differences in state and federal bills including the fact that the federal bill included a neutrality clause
5045428 the obama campaign thinks if they continue to repeat their flimsy story about barack obamas opposition to the common sense born alive infant protection act that their thin explanation will become true the reality is that actual legislative records directly contradict their story
5045429 heres the truth barack obama killed the commonsense born alive infant protection act in the illinois senate and his campaign continues its game of hide and seek thats because his position is heartless there is no baby at any stage even born accidentally that he finds worth protecting where is his heart for the downtrodden when it comes to the most vulnerable human beings it is no wonder he cannot admit to the truth of his leadership as a state senator
5045430 says that they are really concerned about americans finding out the truth about obamas record

5045483 dear kent like you i also am curious about lots of things for gt example im curious about why courtesans sell their pussies and why gt pussies have profound attraction to me
5045484 my mother was also against it for the obvious reasons
5045485 it was just one of those childhood dreams i never grew out of everybody was against it because nobody thinks of jewish people as police officers
5045486 i always wanted to be a cop but my wife sharona was against it
5045487 but i convinced her it took her two years she thinks its a dangerous job i was sick of my other job because there was no room to grow i wanted a future
5045488 the next class is going to have 30 or 40

5045537 every report from the va seems to confirm our worst suspicions about the leadership at the marion va medical center
5045538 the report shows that the management team at marion failed to act when questions were raised about the credentialing of dr veizaga mendez and they failed again when they ignored desperate pleas for additional staff needed to provide adequate care the va needs to implement the recommendations in this report but that is not enough it is past time that a new leadership team is in place in marion and the va must act swiftly to make that happen
5045539 veterans in illinois and throughout the country should expect nothing less than the best health care and treatment at our nations veterans facilities
5045540 this report confirms that a failure in leadership and a breakdown of safeguards allowed these tragedies to occur at the marion va it appears the va has taken action to relieve several individuals of their responsibilities since this investigation was conducted as we wait for the next reports to be published i will continue working with senator durbin and congressman costello to ensure that the va makes leadership changes adds the necessary safeguards and thoroughly reviews its standards at the marion va and other facilities throughout the country
5045541 it is truly staggering that the behavior documented here and the effect that it was having on patient care and morale could occur for years without anyone at the regional level demanding changes
5045542 perhaps most troubling is the fact that patient health was secondary to the financial health of the facility we owe it to our veterans to put their needs first and we owe it to the staff that labored in very difficult conditions to respond to their concerns and create an environment that is conducive to caring for patients we will continue to work with the va to make sure this happens
5045543 as i have noted before there should be nothing other than the care of the veterans as the priority at the marion va medical center
5045544 clearly that was not the case under the previous leadership my colleagues and i will continue to work to see that appropriate changes are carried out and carried out quickly
5045545 i love it and if you turn around ill take a picture of your head

5045553 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5045554 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5045555 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5045556 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5045557 this is a planning took where all things are going
5045558 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5045559 how can i leave our church family where will i work how can we leave something that we started
5045560 why is he sitting right in front of us when the whole restaurant is empty
5045561 ok god if this is what you want then well do it
5045562 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5045563 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5045564 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5045565 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5045566 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5045567 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5045568 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5045569 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5045570 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5045571 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5045572 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5045573 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5045574 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5045575 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5045576 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5045577 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5045578 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5045579 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5045580 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5045581 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5045582 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5045583 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5045584 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5045585 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5045586 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5045587 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5045588 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5045589 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5045590 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5045591 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others

5045593 any money that retirees take out of their portfolios or that they lose in market declines in the first five years of retirement has a higher cost because its money that wont be invested to earn returns in succeeding years when the markets recover
5045594 and the less they have invested after a bear market the less potential they have to benefit from the compounding of any earnings in subsequent years

5045603 im not going to talk about conversations with the campaign
5045604 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it
5045605 at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes
5045606 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states
5045607 i think its the responsibility of the vice president if youre unwilling or unable to do that then i think you should defer to someone else
5045608 i dont want to be vice president im not going to be the nominee

5045626 the key importance of this is that it gives us a clear idea of the sorts of chemicals and mechanisms in the brain that are involved in bipolar disorder
5045627 over a number of years that will help researchers to develop better approaches to diagnosis and treatment
5045628 the brain operates according to how quickly calcium and sodium are going in and out of cells and how much of it goes in and out
5045629 its not going to tell us the whole story it doesnt give you the whole puzzle but its something to build on

5045633 i dont recognize these strange hamsters are they your friends

5045635 one of my most firmly held beliefs is that extra sensory perception can be passed on through contact with lavatory seats
5045636 since its highly probable that you only have one toilet in the bugler household odds are that at some time felicity has parked her pert little rear upon the seat only moments after your great furry backside has vacated it
5045637 why are you going back to this prannick place exactly
5045638 youll need several changes of knickers and probably a sports bra too have you told your mum yet
5045639 how are you gonna explain the loss of those outfits to the area manager
5045640 sombreros dont come cheap ya know algy and as for them ponchos
5045641 that was quite something now it is of the utmost importance that we gain access to the realm into which miss bugler has passed
5045642 if i am to complete the payments upon my immaculate emile chunderson special it will be necessary to continue this investigation into the winter months in order to facilitate this we must remove miss 151 bugler to a place of safety until that time then we will miraculously discover her and return her to the bosom of her mother and the company of her friends and colleagues
5045643 but in order to avoid suspicion she must be taken from the alternate dimension in short we must pass over into prannick and soon we cant have her being killed by a bunch of medieval cutthroats
5045644 did you really think that id fall asleep on such an important mission
5045645 and why did you think i employed you to assist me could it be that several years ago the royal 152 institute for psychic rodent research tested you but had to release you before completion of their tests because of the lack of funding from the pathetic socialist government that ruled at that time could it be that before they pulled the plug on you they discovered that you were a psychic catalyst that anyone with even the slightest inkling of psychic ability is transformed into a full psychic in your presence well the answer is yes i read the science suppliment of the crimblesday edition of the bucktooth times you know i read all about you even if no one else did i was absolutely certain that eventually your talent would have an opportunity to shine and today it did i have it all on video tape too that bugler girl the dormouse she transformed in your presence and she fancies you too were you aware of that get her on side and were on our way to prannick to retrieve her and whats more if you play your cards right you could be having non reproductive sexual intercourse every day of the week with her if you desire it of course you lucky bastard

5045651 this executive is incompetent its time they got with doing the job that they were set up to do its a very definite and a very emphatic no
5045652 martin the police did not plant the bomb your former associates did
5045653 he wanted to come round to the house to pay his respects but i didnt want that and we met in the hotel since then we have communicated intermittently over the years and i did meet him with gerry adams and gerry kelly but that meeting was not a terribly good one
5045654 nothing came of it and i was very disappointed by the response from adams in particular on friday i decided to send a text to martin mcguinness to again ask him to give that vital assistance and urge his fellow republicans to give the information that would convict the bombers but again he wouldnt agree to that but when sinn fein does take that step it will show that they are genuinely into peace and a system of justice which should protect everybody catholic and protestant
5045655 it would be very hard not to improve any of the london airports wed staff security queues properly and passport controls which are a joke at the moment we have people being delayed one or two hours just to get back into their own country
5045656 this is the new biometric scanner but you havent told me about it
5045657 they put the protection of the killers above the attainment of justice
5045658 the very serious concerns about how the police handled this investigation from beginning to end
5045659 that is why my position is to support the calls that are made by families here for the establishment of an independent tribunal
5045660 they obviously have lost all faith and we have seen debacle after debacle in terms of the investigation of this terrible atrocity what we need to do is support the families in the demands they now make
5045661 one of the things that surprised me because i grew up in england was that people here northern ireland protestants and i only learned this fairly recently protestants would have been taught as children that they could not trust catholics i found that astonishing but when i explored it with protestant friends they all agreed that was the case
5045662 i could never understand why it mattered that i was a catholic police ombudsman it baffled me but eventually i was told this was the teaching of some churches to their people and that meant i could understand a lot of what has been said about me
5045663 ryanair planned to clamp down on screenscraping websites that he says are ripping customers off by adding
5045664 the battle against prince nuada which is to lead to co antrim in northern ireland
5045665 it appears to be more difficult for a north of irelander to allow an honest difference of opinion in an opponent so that he is apt to regard the terms opponent and enemy as synonymous
5045666 the short answer is his people are indeed from ulster from county antrim ireland they left from coleraine town circa 1719 and appear on the border of the pennsylvania and maryland colony in the early 1720s his immigrant ancestor was named alexander mckean and yes the two lads who run the ulster heritage dna project are from the same mccain family
5045667 i went to catechism classes but i gave my mother so much grief i didnt take confirmation in eighth grade the nuns frightened me they really made me afraid of dying i thought id go to hell
5045668 it didnt seem to go with reality over the many years ive had religious friends and have gone to church and tried to pray it just didnt work for me im more of a scientist at heart science works for me
5045669 mellowed over the years i used to be more militant i believe if religion helps people get by in life thats ok i can see how prayer can be important in other peoples lives i think its helped a lot of alcoholics and people on drugs people in hard circumstances
5045670 im a good person just because you dont have a belief in god doesnt mean youre not a good person id like a little more tolerance

5045674 the western view of islam is rooted in centuries of mistrust ignorance and stereotypical attitudes
5045675 these attitudes are no longer viable given the immense interdependence shared between the west and the muslims it is to forward mutual understanding that zaytuna commissioned this book
5045676 submission faith and beautification are the three fundamental dimensions of the submitting way they complement and complete each other they are envisioned as three partially overlapping circles and the place where all three circles overlap is the ideal that all muslims strive to attain one who embodies all three in their fullest depth and breadth is closer to living as a true human being in what the quran refers to as the true nature fitrah
5045677 its thrilling that western muslim communities are recognizing the importance of funding projects such as this
5045678 it will only be with generosity such as that displayed by the bay area muslim community that muslims will finally be able to tell their own stories in the west
5045679 this small book can do much to edify those concerned citizens in the west about the beauty and truth of islam
5045680 and by doing so help guide the western understanding of the religion from one based upon distortions to one rooted in authentic knowledge

5045683 the thing we were trying to look at is what is the thing in any given show that probably has the biggest environmental impact

5045697 finding statistically robust associations linked to two proteins that may be involved in regulating such ion channels and that are also thought to be targets of drugs used to clinically to treat bipolar disorder is astonishing
5045698 faced with little agreement among previous studies searching for the genomic hot spots in bipolar disorder these researchers pooled their data for maximal statistical power and unearthed surprising results
5045699 improved understanding of these abnormalities could lead to new hope for the millions of americans affected by bipolar disorder
5045700 my joan youve certainly led us a merry dance where have you been
5045701 i dont recognize these strange hamsters are they your friends
5045702 but i have an intolerance to endorphins thats why mildred prepares me so much porridge its the perfect counter agent nice to see you safe and well you dont happen to have any pancakes left i suppose
5045703 one of my most firmly held beliefs is that extra sensory perception can be passed on through contact with lavatory seats
5045704 since its highly probable that you only have one toilet in the bugler household odds are that at some time felicity has parked her pert little rear upon the seat only moments after your great furry backside has vacated it
5045705 why are you going back to this prannick place exactly
5045706 youll need several changes of knickers and probably a sports bra too have you told your mum yet
5045707 how are you gonna explain the loss of those outfits to the area manager
5045708 sombreros dont come cheap ya know algy and as for them ponchos
5045709 that was quite something now it is of the utmost importance that we gain access to the realm into which miss bugler has passed
5045710 if i am to complete the payments upon my immaculate emile chunderson special it will be necessary to continue this investigation into the winter months in order to facilitate this we must remove miss 151 bugler to a place of safety until that time then we will miraculously discover her and return her to the bosom of her mother and the company of her friends and colleagues
5045711 but in order to avoid suspicion she must be taken from the alternate dimension in short we must pass over into prannick and soon we cant have her being killed by a bunch of medieval cutthroats
5045712 did you really think that id fall asleep on such an important mission
5045713 and why did you think i employed you to assist me could it be that several years ago the royal 152 institute for psychic rodent research tested you but had to release you before completion of their tests because of the lack of funding from the pathetic socialist government that ruled at that time could it be that before they pulled the plug on you they discovered that you were a psychic catalyst that anyone with even the slightest inkling of psychic ability is transformed into a full psychic in your presence well the answer is yes i read the science suppliment of the crimblesday edition of the bucktooth times you know i read all about you even if no one else did i was absolutely certain that eventually your talent would have an opportunity to shine and today it did i have it all on video tape too that bugler girl the dormouse she transformed in your presence and she fancies you too were you aware of that get her on side and were on our way to prannick to retrieve her and whats more if you play your cards right you could be having non reproductive sexual intercourse every day of the week with her if you desire it of course you lucky bastard
5045714 nothing has been the same since losing my father mother amp nanny

5045717 more young black men languish in prison than attend colleges and universities
5045718 we have a system that locks away too many young first time nonviolent offenders for the better part of their lives
5045719 in the overwhelming majority of cases prison remains a lifetime achievement award for persistence in criminal offending absent recidivism or a violent crime the criminal justice system will do everything it can to keep you out of the state or federal slammer
5045720 we have certain sentences that are based less on the kind of crime you commit than on what you look like and where you come from
5045721 in 2005 the black homicide rate was over seven times higher than that of whites and hispanics combined from 1976 to 2005 blacks committed over 52 percent of all murders
5045722 the race of criminals reported by crime victims matches arrest data
5045723 its going to take a lot more than 5 000 or so federal crack defendants a year to account for the 562 000 black prisoners in state and federal facilities at the end of 2006 or the 858 000 black prisoners in custody overall if one includes the population of county and city jails
5045724 the typical criminal commits from 12 to 16 crimes a year not counting drug offenses
5045725 have shown that states that sent a higher fraction of convicts to prison had lower rates of crime even after controlling for all of the other ways poverty urbanization and the proportion of young men in the population that the states differed a high risk of punishment reduces crime deterrence works

5045764 mooney is the cur who almost ruined the economy of spanx eh i say we do more than hang mooney up by his scrotum i say we suffocate him with it
5045765 but hes not here how can you 132 suffocate an absentee
5045766 mooney were going to knock you stupid with these beans then hang you from the abbey spire by your scrotum
5045767 is why someone from an advanced society such as yours would bother owning a dreadful little hovel like the rancid maggot inn i mean its ghastly i feel like i want to wash my paws all the time and im certain ive picked up some ghastly fur complaint here too
5045768 how much did you pay for our lizard pasties and rough ale

5045782 the latest information i have is this is still under discussion i promise ill post as soon as i know
5045783 the simple answer is brian pothier goes to ltir that alone puts the capitals less than 200 000 over the cap at which point a couple of scenarios could take place
5045784 does karl alzner start the season in the nhl if he doesnt then problem solved
5045785 is chris clark healthy enough to start the season if hes not he starts on ltir and buys the capitals some breathing room early on and then its a matter of how long is he out
5045786 my guess is that they start by seeing if clark has to go on ltir and bp after that they watch alzner to see if hes really ready for the nhl and after that they send erskine down and replace him with lepisto if erskine happens to be claimed on recall waivers a trade is certainly possible but thats an aspect i dont even try to speculate on without knowing more details
5045787 my guess is as good as anyone elses on the capitals or most other teams but i dont instinctively go to

5045831 o ye who believe take not the jews and the christians for your friends and protectors they are but friends and protectors to each other and he amongst you that turns to them in friendship is of them verily allah guideth not a people unjust
5045832 ye are the best of peoples evolved for mankind enjoining what is right forbidding what is wrong and believing in allah if only the people of the book had faith it were best for them among them are some who have faith but most of them are perverted transgressors
5045833 those who believe fight in the cause of all h and those who disbelieve fight in the cause of t gh t satan etc so fight you against the friends of shait n satan ever feeble indeed is the plot of shait n satan
5045834 and the jews say uzair ezra is the son of all h and the christians say messiah is the son of all h that is a saying from their mouths they imitate the saying of the disbelievers of old all hs curse be on them how they are deluded away from the truth
5045835 the believers should not take the unbelievers as friends or helpers in preference to the believers he who does this does not belong to allah in anything unless you have a fear of them
5045836 it is he who has sent his messenger muhammad saw with guidance and the religion of truth isl m to make it superior over all religions even though the mushrik n polytheists pagans idolaters disbelievers in the oneness of all h hate it
5045837 but those who disbelieve in the oneness of all h isl mic monotheism for them is destruction and all h will make their deeds vain
5045838 verily those who disbelieve in the religion of isl m the qur n and prophet muhammad peace be upon him from among the people of the scripture jews and christians and al mushrik n will abide in the fire of hell they are the worst of creatures

5045852 people come here because of the lake the people and the atmosphere and we just wanted to bring all that back together
5045853 there are a lot of people that live on the lake that cant afford to have the sandbags removed or pay for the dumpster we have a lot of elderly people who cant physically take up an 80 pound sandbag
5045854 we got a lot of food up here we got all kinds of food and drink and entertainment the whole night
5045855 people just need to come out here open their wallets and be our partner in trying to rebuild the area
5045856 i never could have imagined that this could have happened when i purchased my cottage two years ago its just really gratifying to see all of the people that were out helping doing the sandbagging when the flood was coming people really rallied
5045857 and i told them the same thing and they laughed

5045866 russia is not going to launch nuclear missiles at anybody
5045867 im not quite sure why this deputy chief of staff felt compelled to make those kinds of threats
5045868 it appears that on present form the iraqi government probably wont proceed with most of these or all of them
5045869 but i think that some of the companies are open to continued discussions even on relationship grounds and some of the companies dont think its worth their time
5045870 in these days of 24 hour news you tend to get reporters standing by the satellite dishes instead of discovering the story
5045871 i spent about 45 minutes talking to the police and the demonstrators and nothing much was going on it was a bit of stand off
5045872 i later heard her speaking to camera about the threat of violence she was trying to make predictions and i thought no thats not news
5045873 when we found the contamination it was another sign that the way we currently manufacture heparin is simply unsafe
5045874 unlike the current heparin that is harvested from possibly disease carrying animals in often very poor conditions our fully synthetic heparin will be created in a pharmaceutical manufacturing environment from fermentation to packaging this will give drug manufacturers extreme control over the safety and purity of the product
5045875 ultimately drug companies are going to need to produce tons of this drug to keep up with global demand
5045876 such levels of productions are further down the road we think that in five years it is very possible that this drug could reach human clinical trials
5045877 with the problems associated with contaminated heparin produced from pig tissues in china a non animal source of this essential drug is gaining importance

5045879 if heparin is prepared the right way it should be consistent and safe even from an animal source

5045881 scully is making the same point everyone else is making
5045882 he says the stats indicate you are having success hitting behind ramirez tell me that isnt the case
5045883 listen im so tired of talking about this stuff it diminishes my whole career and all the hard work i take it as an insult

5045888 acquire their reality their identity only to the extent of their participation in a transcendent reality
5045889 in the homogeneous and infinite expanse in which no point of reference is possible and hence no orientation is established the hierophany appearance of the sacred reveals an absolute fixed point a center
5045890 for archaic man reality is a function of the imitation of a celestial
5045891 knowing the origin of an object an animal a plant and so on is equivalent to acquiring a magical power over them
5045892 it is the first manifestation of a thing that is significant and valid
5045893 when from march to may russia imposed an escalating series of import restrictions first on wine vegetables and fruits then on sparkling wine and brandy finally georgian mineral water at the time one of the countrys most important exports
5045894 russian authorities denied basic rights to many of the detained
5045895 including access to a lawyer or the possibility of appealing the expulsion decision taken against them most were given trials lasting only a few minutes georgians were held in sometimes appalling conditions of detention and in some cases were subjected to threats and other ill treatment two georgians died in custody awaiting expulsion
5045896 that columns of russian tanks and troops had crossed georgias sovereign borders the thousands of troops tanks and artillery amassed on our border are evidence of how long russia had been planning this aggression
5045897 grattez un peu le communiste et vous trouverez le philistin
5045898 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5045899 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5045900 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5045901 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5045902 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5045903 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5045904 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5045905 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5045906 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5045907 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5045908 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5045909 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5045910 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

5045917 by outsurcing the the more repetitive commodity work we could in effect de commoditiize our shared service business and allow it to focus on innovation and developing new business capabilities
5045918 i think its good for the sport that were pushing each other
5045919 most of the things you hear about rivalries its people who hate each other but thats totally not us
5045920 theyre totally comfortable around one another for a couple of guys who have a lot of serious stuff to think about you wouldnt know it when theyre together
5045921 dear jesus thank you for our day and our food
5045922 were just done praying how did you finish your food already
5045923 do you know how i learned to say to the praise of god
5045924 caleb i said the best prayer ever dad said so
5045925 nuh uh dad did you say andrew said the best prayer ever
5045926 everybody at this table loves god the same and by the same i mean a lot
5045927 andrew you dont own the corner on god lovin and neither do you caleb
5045928 on a long term view and on a fundamentals view i am very comfortable with the outlook a year from now for the likes of potash corp and other companies like it we think they will be generating significant earnings
5045929 we dont look at this sector as a bear market we look at it as a correction and we expected the correction
5045930 the chinese are not in the drivers seat here to negotiate from a point of strength they need the volumes and they have no second choice
5045931 i think next year we are going to see a bigger bump in volumes than in prices any price gains next year will be more marginal and more opportunistic rather than fundamental
5045932 the thing to remember is that farmers both here and abroad have not been confronted with these extremely high potash prices the demand destruction will be substantial but it has not occurred yet
5045933 our family for its compassionate and sensitive portrayal of the third sex their bonding and their aspirations the film traces their roots sourced from mythology combined with a mesmerizing one person performance of the traumas and stigma experienced by their community
5045934 for an innovative narrative that gives voice to a marginalized
5045935 for the lyrically quiet unobtrusive and sensitive pacing of the
5045936 the local residents have accepted seetha as one of them we had a good rapport with them so when we shot in public spaces there were no issues
5045937 we decided to make the film when we met aasha through pritham who is our friend we wanted to do it as a collaborative project not one that dictated terms to them
5045938 we wanted to make a film which would question the way people look at the hijras we wanted to look at the human rights violation the stigmas and also look at the warmth and celebratory aspect of it
5045939 they become a regular family so the woman seetha does the cooking she does assert herself but in trying to do so she asserts her womanly identity even more one of the things that struck us was that they were normal but in trying to be normal they had to play out the politics of being normal in some sense

5045946 im concerned about all these people whove been with me for three days and havent eaten if i send them away hungry some may collapse before they get home because theyve come a long way
5045947 how can we get enough bread to feed everyone out here in the country
5045948 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5045949 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5045950 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5045951 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5045952 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5045953 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5045954 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5045955 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5045956 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5045957 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5045958 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5045959 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5045960 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5045961 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5045962 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5045963 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
5045964 our writing equipment takes part in the forming of our thoughts

5045969 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5045970 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5045971 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5045972 its a great event i have eight wins up here tying the record for the most wins at trois rivieres this one is special we worked hard to tie the record i was pretty close to tying it last year this year the team worked really hard to give a good car to me and andy im happy to be on the podium and win
5045973 obama is an old man trying to act like he is all that and then some but it is just so fake
5045974 mccain is cool he was a fighter pilot and he was a pow he kicked butt and took names besides john mccain looks like a nice guy who tells the truth and does not try to be what he is not obama on the other hand acts like some rock star that has smurfs lips and he is creepy

5045977 a strategic diversion has been created for russia the south ossetia capital has been shelled and a large georgian tank force has been heading towards the border american marines a thousand of them have recently been in georgia training the georgian military forces russia has stated that it will not sit by and allow the georgians to attack south ossetia this could get bad and remember it is just a strategic diversion but one that could have horrific effects
5045978 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline
5045979 russia actively tends to isolate the central asian region from direct access to world economy especially to energy supplies if georgia government is destabilized western access to baku caspian sea and further will be limited

5045982 cincinnati officials are assembling financing for a 132 million system that would connect the citys riverfront stadiums downtown business district and uptown neighborhoods which include six hospitals and the university of cincinnati in a six to eight mile loop depending on the final financing package fares may be free 50 cents or 1 the city plans to pay for the system with existing tax revenue and 30 million in private investment the plan requires the approval of mayor mark mallory a proponent and the city council
5045983 more than a dozen have existing lines including new orleans which is restoring a system devastated by hurricane katrina and denver houston salt lake city and charlotte n c have introduced or are planning to introduce streetcars

5045995 there was a lot of stick from some of the media saying we were going to struggle this season so were happy

5046000 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5046001 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5046002 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5046003 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5046004 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5046005 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5046006 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5046007 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5046008 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5046009 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5046010 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5046011 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5046012 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5046013 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5046014 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5046015 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5046016 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5046017 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5046018 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5046019 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5046020 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5046021 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5046022 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5046023 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5046024 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5046025 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5046026 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5046027 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5046028 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5046029 who are open to doing something on the production side
5046030 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5046031 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5046032 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5046033 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5046034 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5046035 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5046036 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5046037 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5046038 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5046039 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5046040 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5046041 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5046042 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5046043 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5046044 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5046045 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5046046 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5046047 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5046048 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5046049 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5046050 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5046051 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5046052 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5046053 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5046054 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5046055 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5046056 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5046057 esta es una cuesti n que no est sobre la mesa
5046058 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5046059 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5046060 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5046061 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5046062 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5046063 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5046064 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5046065 its by far my favorite larabar which is saying a lot because i basically love them all
5046066 you know hes got a longer track record than that
5046067 one of the things i think we have to unify the country around is having an intelligent energy policy thats what were going to be talking about

5046071 we played well in the first half and their goalkeeper made several good saves to keep them in the match
5046072 our attacking play in the first half was good but as soon as we lost ryan giggs to a hamstring injury and michael carrick with an ankle which is swollen up badly hell be out for two to three weeks we lost a bit of our experience in midfield
5046073 we ended up having to push patrice evra out to the left side of midfield and he is obviously not our best attacking player being a left back
5046074 newcastle were good on the counter attack and in goalscorer obafemi martins and damien duff they have players with quality in these positions if you dont stop them they can be dangerous
5046075 we had possession of the ball but didnt make it count at times but in light of the people we had missing it was a creditable result for us

5046078 fue una carrera rara por lo que pas que seguramente condicion todo lo que pas despu s yo trat de concentrarme en mi auto y de no cometer errores que en un circuito como san juan te cuestan muy caro es un muy buen resultado para mi y para todo el equipo que despu s de lo que pas el viernes con el viento necesitaba algo as se lo dedico a toda la gente que trabaj much simo para que pudi ramos salir a pista

5046084 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it

5046086 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states
5046087 i think its the responsibility of the vice president if youre unwilling or unable to do that then i think you should defer to someone else
5046088 i dont want to be vice president im not going to be the nominee

5046102 we have made progress in the implementation of our new strategic focus and the transformation of biovail
5046103 our cost efficiency initiatives are beginning to produce results our business development efforts are extremely active and biovails balance sheet and cash balances are robust
5046104 i think what it shows is we have a very competitive marketplace here in saskatchewan and the companies are responding to that
5046105 they see a royalty structure they see a regulatory structure they see a business climate that is very very positive
5046106 the companies look at it bid what they think is appropriate and then as the ministry we look and see whether we feel that its competitive or not
5046107 in this case we didnt think that was the case and withdrew them

5046127 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5046128 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5046129 faulty and fraudulent appraisals were an important contributor to the losses that the federal government suffered during the saving and loan crisis
5046130 we got to this point by a lack of enforcement the public has the right to expect the appraisal boards are taking care of that problem
5046131 do you know what that would have meant the net effect is it would have effectively shut down mortgage lending in that state
5046132 to take that action would have been an unbelievable disruption to the economy i wasnt going to do that

5046140 we had nothing about this at the city no police report nothing as the years went by i guess the incident disappeared
5046141 it didnt change the fact that he died in the line of duty
5046142 the circumstances of why he died maybe explains why the story was buried pushed aside it was a terrible accident
5046143 i knew it would be some work even before i started looking into the death
5046144 but i figured that if he did really exist and truly did give his life for his community he deserves to be recognized and not forgotten
5046145 the stone was so old that the writing was fading
5046146 i rubbed dirt on it so i could see the imprint i snapped a few pictures it was exciting

5046149 his mind set on the suspicious trio mcdermott failed to stop whereupon one of his companions shot at him he dropped to the ground
5046150 it must have been a very bleak day for our community
5046151 ill tell you i was surprised when he called me
5046152 when i started this research he was constantly on my mind
5046153 it was more about closure but now i feel ive done my part for him to get him remembered its out of my hands

5046156 holding exit row passengers liable for damages resulting from their inattention to safety materials could deter exit row passengers from ignoring safety information and compensate those victims harmed
5046157 those responsible for informing exit row passengers of their duties could also become targets for a negligence cause of action in the end the airline could likely become involved in such actions thus the importance of providing exit row passengers with detailed briefings to prepare them for emergencies cannot be underestimated
5046158 exit procedures for emergency evacuations are critical and if not followed could lead to tragedy
5046159 passenger attention to safety communications were found to be generally low
5046160 perceptions that it is socially undesirable to pay attention to safety information
5046161 the passenger would really have to do something very stupid to not enjoy immunity from this rule the goal of the rule is to encourage people to help others without having to worry about a civil lawsuit
5046162 listening to the briefing of the crew and acknowledging giving the impression they accepted the mandate to help
5046163 there must not be negligence and passengers must to the best of their abilities be able to follow the crews directives
5046164 the entire process of delegating giving a mandate a responsibility to someone with no expertise in the evacuation of the plane

5046184 das ziel besteht erkennbar darin die seit langem betriebene kampagne gegen watzal durch einen massiven konzertierten einsatz zum erfolgreichen abschluss zu bringen es scheint dabei weniger um die person zu gehen als um das ziel durch exemplarische bestrafung eines israel kritikers einen einsch chternden effekt zu erzielen die wortf hrer dieser kampagne berufen sich dabei auf die in der europ ischen union vor drei jahren verabschiedete arbeitsdefinition des antisemitismus dort wird erstmals der begriff des antisemitismus ganz offiziell auf kritik an der israelischen regierungspolitik ausgeweitet in der ffentlichkeit fand dieses dokument bisher kaum beachtung die angriffe gegen watzal dienen auch dazu jetzt die praktische umsetzung der tendenzi sen neudefinition einzufordern wenn das in diesem fall gel nge w re ein beispiel f r k nftige kampagnen gesetzt

5046231 we have been intimately involved with helping resolve the many noise issues associated with gas exploration in the fort worth area barnett shale being based in shreveport we are now ideally positioned to help our fellow residents communities and local governments address these same issues without having to reinvent the wheel
5046232 the lse system is gaining many friends in the oil amp gas industry
5046233 although the lse system is well known in the transportation and manufacturing worlds its durability and acoustic performance has proven an ideal solution for exploration and production related noise including gas compression and transmission facilities generators and transformers landowners definitely like the noise reducing performance of the lse system and they generally prefer its appearance over other sound wall materials as well less noise and happier landowners is a win win for both the exploration companies and the local communities

5046295 our best intelligence estimate is that pandemic avian flu has already been created through genetic engineering in the united states fusing the deadly genome of the 1918 pandemic misnamed the spanish flu with the dna of the innocuous h5n1 virus in a growth medium of human kidney cells according to the national institutes of health and the vaccines manufacturer some virologists believe that this would insure that the man made mutant virus recognizes human cells and knows how to invade them
5046296 a basic virological fact that the public has not been told is that it is impossible to make a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist
5046297 given the shockingly obvious lack of any threat from an un weaponized h5n1 virus how can we explain the bush administration spending billions of dollars preparing each of the 50 states for what it calls the inevitable bird flu pandemic which they say could kill half or more of all americans and similar numbers of people around the globe
5046298 tyson foods inc has begun killing and burying the carcasses of 15 000 hens from a flock that tested positive for exposure to a strain of the bird flu in northwest arkansas state officials said tuesday
5046299 one of the highest rates of injury and illness of any industry
5046300 dangerous chemicals blood faecal matter exacerbated by poor ventilation and often extreme temperatures workers typically faced hazardous conditions loud noise must work in narrow confines with sharp tools and dangerous machinery
5046301 an experiment mating h5n1 avian flu viruses and a strain of human flu in a laboratory produced a surprising number of hybrid viruses that were biologically fit a new study reveals and while none of the offspring viruses was as virulent as the original h5n1 about one in five were lethal to mice at low doses showing they retained at least a portion of the power of their dangerous parent
5046302 the work suggests that under the right circumstances and no one is clear what all of those are the two types of flu viruses could swap genes in a way that might allow the h5n1 virus to acquire the capacity to trigger a pandemic that process is called reassortment this study is just showing exactly that there is a risk this virus can successfully reassort with a human virus said richard webby director of the world health organizations collaborating centre for influenza research at st jude hospital in memphis tennessee

5046304 the u s government is taking steps to minimize the need to make vaccine allocation decisions by supporting efforts to increase domestic influenza vaccine production capacity significant funding is being provided to develop new vaccine technologies that allow production of enough pandemic influenza vaccine for any person in the united states who wants to be vaccinated within six months of a pandemic declaration
5046305 two injections given 28 days apart may provide limited protection if a pandemic occurs
5046306 if h5n1 does mutate it is unclear if vaccines developed now would still work against a pandemic strain
5046307 three polish doctors and six nurses are facing criminal prosecution after a number of homeless people died following medical trials for a vaccine to the h5n1 bird flu virus
5046308 the spanish flu influenza virus that killed 20 40 million people in 1918 is currently under reconstruction several genes of the extraordinarily lethal 1918 flu virus have been isolated and introduced into contemporary flu strains these proved to be lethal for mice while virus constructs with genes from a current flu virus types had hardly any effect these experiments may easily be abused for military purposes but provide little benefit from a medical or public health point of view
5046309 the 1918 spanish flu was highly infectious and in comparison to contemporary flu viruses killed a very high percentage of those infected including many younger people the spanish flu alone caused the medium life expectancy in the us in 1918 to drop by 10 years hence flu viruses are perceived today as a serious biological warfare threat just two weeks ago a 15 million dollar research grant was awarded in the us to develop protective measures especially against a bioterrorist attack with flu viruses
5046310 despite the very dangerous nature of the 1918 virus efforts to reconstruct it started in the mid 1990s when dr jeffrey taubenberger from the us armed forces institute of pathology in washington dc succeeded in recovering and sequencing fragments of the viral rna from preserved tissues of 1918 victims in the current issue of the scientific journal emerging infectious diseases new genetic details of the 1918 flu virus will be published
5046311 but after partially unravelling the genetic sequence of the virus the scientists went a step further and began bringing the spanish flu back to life unnoticed by the public they succeeded in creating a live virus containing two 1918 genes that proved to be very lethal in animal experiments this experiment is only one genetic step away from taking the 1918 demon entirely out of the bottle
5046312 a resuscitation of the spanish flu is neither necessary nor warranted from a public health point of view
5046313 were tempted to say that nobody in their right mind would ever use these things

5046315 donate 60 million doses of h5n1 vaccine to the world health organization who over 3 years for the establishment of an h5n1 vaccine global stockpile
5046316 the h5n1 virus is currently circulating in some of the poorest regions of the world and an outbreak of pandemic influenza would most likely hit populations living in areas with limited access to vaccines this donation of h5n1 vaccine aims to address the needs of those most vulnerable populations in addition to supporting the efforts of governments
5046317 it is essential that industry collaborates with international organizations such as who the bill and melinda gates foundation and other global health players

5046326 the beetle has a one year life cycle so you wont be able to tell that theres been damage most of the trees that are being attacked right for up to 9 12 months
5046327 sometimes after the tree has been compromised woodpeckers will come in and strip the bark off its then you start to see trees turning yellow and red

5046329 a lot is dependent on weather i think a lot of the beetles would prefer to stay up in the high elevation forests where there is a lot of food the unpredictable factor is how quickly they will build up in the city

5046453 a really poor and foolish decision on the part of our key guys
5046454 i want to apologize to nascar to our partners to toyota guys
5046455 a couple of guys chose to make a decision here that really impacts all of us
5046456 to me the frustrating part is why for us in the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you
5046457 no matter what nascar does were going to address this issue in house figure out exactly what happened and those that were responsible theres going to be a punishment for that
5046458 i know our guys were probably frustrated from the standpoint of wanting to show that we have less horsepower than we had before and wanted it to look like were handicapped more than we actually were
5046459 that is not an excuse to possibly come back and then win it again thats awesome and that would be a great story
5046460 this one here is clearly an intentional opportunity to lead somebody astray
5046461 we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us

5046482 the proposal made amid growing outrage among russias neighbours over its military campaign in georgia could see ukraine added to moscows nuclear hitlist
5046483 the fact that ukraine is no longer a party to the 1992 agreement allows it to launch active cooperation with european countries to integrate its information
5046484 the international community is clear that south ossetia and abkhazia are part of georgia and the us fully recognises this reality
5046485 smoking disrupts the cells lining the blood vessels it increases blood fibrogen levels which makes blood more likely to clot it increases the stickiness of platelets the cells that form blood clots and it also decreases the bodys natural clot dissolving mechanism
5046486 we uphold the three historic creeds as expressing the rule of faith of the one holy catholic and apostolic church
5046487 we uphold the thirty nine articles as containing the true doctrine of the church agreeing with gods word and as authoritative for anglicans today
5046488 there is hardly a theologian of note in the west today who believes the filioque clause means anything other than
5046489 the holy ghost is of the father and of the son neither made nor created nor begotten but proceeding
5046490 i love it when you can go about your daily business with the knowledge that you have a little secret of your own on underneath lingerie shouldnt be something you just put on for your lover you should do it for you
5046491 i love it when you can go about your daily business with the knowledge that you have a little secret of your own on underneath lingerie shouldnt be something you just put on for your lover you should do it for you its not about seducing men its about embracing womanhood
5046492 i know the picture the paparazzi want is me coming out of starbucks in jeans with my hair all messy but thats just not going to happen i just think that when you take a minute to look your best you get what you want and i pretty much get what i want
5046493 im extremely happy and proud today because we have made a breakthrough in the rowing history of china
5046494 we decided that we have to turn this pressure into motivation
5046495 i think that says a lot for the u s program
5046496 they were ready they came down smiling to the boathouse which is a good sign
5046497 i was thinking that a lot of people have said that its impossible for chinese rowers to get a gold in the olympic games
5046498 it looks like valeri has snapped his achilles and will be out for six months it is a huge blow for the lad
5046499 we are all desperately disappointed for him this has come on top of being out for a year already so it is a huge blow for him
5046500 it was also not an ideal way for us to start this game
5046501 in fairness i was pleased with the first half performance we had to combat the physical presence the pace and effectiveness of set plays that villa have
5046502 we were in the game at 1 1 but then had an eight minute spell when we conceded the type of goals that we are not happy with from our point of view
5046503 you could see the confidence go flooding into gabby once he had scored that first goal the other two goals were magnificent and i was delighted for him
5046504 in terms of england his time will come it is a long season and he knows what is ahead this is a great start for him
5046505 i was a bit surprised ashley did not get in the england squad but his time will come as well i have no doubts whatsoever that they will make it through
5046506 we had the better of the first half but had a couple of chances we did not take
5046507 i felt at half time we just needed more of the same but we had to be careful because in possession city were very good
5046508 could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
5046509 i felt the closest thing to depression that i have ever felt in my life
5046510 do you think its ok to write about the prophets sex life
5046511 another example of a quiet wave of self censorship and cultural cowardice sweeping western art circles
5046512 this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community
5046513 at the same time the muslims want to kill me im pandering to them
5046514 when people talk about an offended muslim being the same as a violent muslim to me that sounds like racism
5046515 what a pistol she seemed like someone i would want to know
5046516 scandal blew in on the errant wind when i rode into medina clutching safwans waist my neighbors rushed into the street what they saw my wrapper fallen to my shoulders unheeded loose hair lashing my face the wife of gods prophet entwined around another man
5046517 the key importance of this is that it gives us a clear idea of the sorts of chemicals and mechanisms in the brain that are involved in bipolar disorder
5046518 over a number of years that will help researchers to develop better approaches to diagnosis and treatment
5046519 the brain operates according to how quickly calcium and sodium are going in and out of cells and how much of it goes in and out
5046520 its not going to tell us the whole story it doesnt give you the whole puzzle but its something to build on
5046521 the liberal soul shall be made fat and he that watereth shall be watered also himself
5046522 you have a choice be a fighting liberal or sit quietly i know what i am what are you
5046523 it means i believe that jesus christ died for my sins and that i am redeemed through him that is a source of strength and sustenance on a daily basis i know that i dont walk alone but what it also means i think is a sense of obligation to embrace not just words but also through deeds and expectations that god has for us and that means thinking about the least of these acting justly loving mercy and walking humbly with our god
5046524 our judeo christian principles dictate that we do what we can to help people who are oppressed throughout the world i would like to tell you that i still think that even in the worst places in the world today they still harbor this hope and dream someday to be like us and have freedom and democracy we remain my friends the most unusual experiment in history and im privileged to spend every day of my life in it i know what it is like to be without it

5046529 its definitely a family comedy with an 80s john hughes feel a little like uncle buck
5046530 its heartwarming and sure it will appeal mostly to teenagers but parents can also come along for the ride
5046531 it was no longer about saving the country but about stopping the crimes
5046532 he was interested in the standards of serious literature and he tried to in a commercial magazine impose upon its pages some of the lofty notions he had about the written word
5046533 the attack was short sharp and deadly enough to send the georgians fleeing in humiliating panic

5046535 weve been at it a long time and we havent had a break its a long four years between olympics
5046536 i just think it will probably be better for us mentally more so than physically to have a bit of a break
5046537 rob is a legend to come back and perform the way he has i dont think you can ever say youve had enough
5046538 weve never taken time off before so you never know how it would work for us physically
5046539 and until then you never know how big the urge will be to get back
5046540 well sit down with richard and work out whats best
5046541 hes been an awesome guy to train with hes the best in the world so weve been very lucky
5046542 we were slowly getting our confidence back every week a little bit more
5046543 i guess after poland i never thought we would be the ones getting the gold medal
5046544 but it wasnt until our heats race last week that i really felt we were competitive thats all we wanted to be then wed get a shot at getting a medal
5046545 you talk about writing the twins off but i think the form from last years world champs and the world cup regattas this year has in some ways been a bad omen people who did badly there have done well here
5046546 there used to be a whole brigade here and now its less soon these policies will backfire in
5046547 we used to depend mostly on coalition forces but unfortunately the footprint of the u s has been reduced
5046548 frankly we dont trust the iraqi police one hundred percent
5046549 when the aug 8 bomb went off in tal afar the police joined with the civilians to attack sunnis when we didnt join the fight they called us terrorists
5046550 as the iraqi units stood up over the past 18 months they took over our bases
5046551 we confirmed that they could operate in company and battalion strength
5046552 security forces want to focus on the true fight right now but they are forced into a
5046553 georgia will never give up a square kilometre of its territory
5046554 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5046555 no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempt to legalize ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to its knees and undermine our democratic system
5046556 georgia is a sovereign state and the territorial integrity of the state must be provided for
5046557 i wish peace for my country and for our children we do not want to live in fear
5046558 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
5046559 i dont want to be the vice president i am not going to be the nominee
5046560 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the fox news sunday
5046561 if youre unwilling or unable to do that then i think you should defer to someone else
5046562 i hate to disappoint you but nothing to report today
5046563 i dont have anything for you on the vice presidential front
5046564 running a plant day to day no matter what is challenging but we are ambitious and determined to restore it
5046565 it would be great to have the plant but have it run by a different company or a different family
5046566 theres a lot of ups and downs when you are recruiting so quickly
5046567 its a process thats evolving every day were constantly building
5046568 coming in within six weeks with enough people to get the plant to full capacity isnt a challenge its nearly impossible
5046569 i raised a fuss and i think im going to start next week
5046570 but some of those guys just got sent on a bus right back home
5046571 you see it and you are reminded of your commitment to do good
5046572 it is a struggle something we must deal with but with enough money and the right time and if we stay the course theres no reason we cant get there
5046573 with the problems associated with contaminated heparin produced from pig tissues in china a non animal source of this essential drug is gaining importance
5046574 a safer version of the drug could result in less adverse effects and fewer deaths
5046575 if heparin is prepared the right way it should be consistent and safe even from an animal source
5046576 our biotech version of heparin will be prepared in a controlled environment ensuring that it is pure and free of contaminants
5046577 the only true prison is fear and freedom from fear is true freedom
5046578 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5046579 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5046580 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5046581 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5046582 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5046583 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5046584 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5046585 you dont marry someone you can live with you marry the person who you cannot live without
5046586 life has taught us that love does not consist in gazing at each other but in looking outward together in the same direction
5046587 so much of what we know of love we learn at home
5046588 a kiss is a lovely trick designed by nature to stop speech when words become superfluous
5046589 he that falls in love with himself will have no rivals
5046590 love is like playing the piano first you must learn to play by the rules then you must forget the rules and play from your heart
5046591 if i could reach up and hold a star for every time youve made me smile the entire evening sky would be in the palm of my hand
5046592 relationships of all kinds are like sand held in your hand held loosely with an open hand the sand remains where it is the minute you close your hand and squeeze tightly to hold on the sand trickles through your fingers you may hold onto some of it but most will be spilled a relationship is like that held loosely with respect and freedom for the other person it is likely to remain intact but hold too tightly too possessively and the relationship slips away and is lost
5046593 truly loving another means letting go of all expectations it means full acceptance even celebration of anothers personhood
5046594 if you judge people you have no time to love them
5046595 love begins with a smile grows with a kiss and ends with a teardrop
5046596 we come to love not by finding a perfect person but by learning to see an imperfect person perfectly
5046597 get the f ck out now we are a non partisan organization and we dont want that sh t here

5046602 we spotted a twin engine aircraft coming over the country park and as it came over we noticed it was fairly low and literally within a split second we saw another much smaller light aircraft come from the right
5046603 the twin engined aircraft struck the light aircraft and just totally destroyed it
5046604 we are proud to announce the new lineup after a few years with various problems it feels great that we now are a working band again things just didnt work out the way we wanted with
5046605 we are busy getting that album togehter and also rehearsing some old songs because we want to play live so it might be that we will do some shows even though we dont have a new album out

5046643 our porto would never be as good as it is without this grape spirit which has no taste and here smell it dona ana also no aroma
5046644 but we also add the alcohol to give the aroma a good kick in the ass
5046645 the dona ana rosa understands everything better when you talk like a trooper
5046646 or rather one day shell remember shes been away too long
5046647 when the yeast dies about half the grape sugar has turned into alcohol
5046648 and its the remaining sugar that gives porto its sweet taste dona ana
5046649 youll taste it in five ten maybe forty years my love its up to the cellar master in vila nova da gaia
5046650 what the hell does he have to do with our wine
5046651 the cellar master and his team will take care of the wine as if it were a baby and im not kidding ana rosa
5046652 and listen to this one rui it must be stored in oak casks by law ha true or not
5046653 bravo at last something you do remember im sure you also remember that porto is the result of the very careful blending of at least fifteen wines dont you some for the colour or the aroma others for the body the bouquet or the smoothness
5046654 believe it or not that part i remember hey rui why dont you keep our wine at the quinta and let me bathe in it ive got it all man colour perfume body and muito muito smoothness as you darn well know
5046655 this woman wont only exhaust you shell also drive me crazy
5046656 we must find a special name for this years vintage porto dona cabral
5046657 the dona ana rosa deserves to have a wine named after her
5046658 youre an emancipated man my friend vintage porto is called the lord of the wines isnt it why dont we make it the lady of our wines eh just this once the chefe and i will decide what name to give it in a little while lets say a few months
5046659 this is an issue that is not on the table

5046665 i wanted to make the perfect coney island experience something that captivates thats an immediate visceral reaction and that lingers in the memory
5046666 theres no better place than an amusement park to confront horror and things were fearful of
5046667 the fact that it took place near roller coasters and cotton candy sends an important message we here can engage in frivolity and fun at a time when in our name this is happening to people somewhere else
5046668 the idea behind this is the person is sucking in a little bit of water and a lot of air so they feel like theyre drowning the real power of the interrogator is the fear of the unknown
5046669 but i think if youre for or against this technique the conversation about this needs to start we need to recognize what it truly is which is torture
5046670 its february february middle of winter february is supposed to be cold
5046671 i am not the only one who didnt get the medical care i needed it was routine to wait weeks or months for even basic care
5046672 they carried him in shackles to a car bruising his arms and legs
5046673 we calculated about 135 times hed been interrogated and about the first 120 the only interest they had was al jazeera
5046674 they told him that they thought al jazeera was an al qaeda front
5046675 they were trying to get him to finger a number of well known al jazeera journalists as being in the muslim brotherhood
5046676 they wanted me to betray the principles of my job and to turn me into a spy
5046677 if we were going to try to silence al jazeera it would be at a higher level of personnel than some cameraman trainee
5046678 was trained by al jazeera in the use of cameras
5046679 as a vehicle to show the world that human rights abuses still occur all over the globe

5046695 we know without question people want to see the best viewing experience
5046696 if you watched the olympics in high definition on a big screen you are not going to watch it online so that is why there isnt going to be a cannibalization
5046697 the more things changed the more they remain the same
5046698 the reason for the west coast tape delay is simple
5046699 the more things changed the more they remain the same
5046700 i think after 9 11 my friends we should have told americans to join the peace corps expand the military serve a cause greater than your self interest
5046701 we still dont abide by that basic precept of matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
5046702 that basic principle applies to poverty it applies to racism and sexism it applies to not thinking about providing ladders of opportunity for people to get into the middle class
5046703 i have to tell you up front both of these guys are my friends they both care deeply about america they are both patriots
5046704 they have very different ideas on how america can be strengthened
5046705 i was so obsessed with me and the reasons i might be dissatisfied i couldnt focus on other people
5046706 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
5046707 means im saved and forgiven our faith encompasses not just america but the world
5046708 for a minute there we were just two christians worshipping together
5046709 i dont think he was a strong enough jurist or a legal thinker at the time for that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation
5046710 this nomination should be based on the criteria on a proven record of strictly adhering to the constitution and not legislating from the bench
5046711 they achieved a revolution now the russians are coming in there in an act of aggression we have to not only bring about cease fire we have to have honor
5046712 on this particular issue if you believe that life begins at conception and you are consistent then i cant argue with you on that
5046713 what i can do is say are there ways we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies
5046714 for me as a christian it is a sacred union gods in the mix

5046733 non sta me pronunciarmi per quello che posso dire che mi pare sia in corso una svolta culturale rispetto a quanto accadeva fino a qualche anno fa quando i soldati ma anche le forze dellordine e gli uomini in divisa venivano additati come guerrafondai e la pace sembrava fosse monopolio di certe manifestazioni dove sventolavano bandiere multicolori
5046734 la grande svolta consiste in questo che la divisa oggi diventata presidio di libert in italia e allestero gli italiani hanno superato alcuni meccanismi culturali e a volte propagandistici che facevano del militare un nemico
5046735 fanno delle nostre forze armate un vero presidio di libert

5046763 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
5046764 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
5046765 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
5046766 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5046767 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5046768 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5046769 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
5046770 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
5046771 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
5046772 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5046773 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5046774 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

5046794 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5046795 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5046801 according to the deal the palestinian organizations could establish bases in italy enjoyed freedom of movement when entering and exiting the country and could move around without undergoing mandatory security checks because they were protected by the secret service
5046802 during my time as interior minister i learned that plo people were holding heavy artillery in their homes and protected by diplomatic immunity as representatives of the arab league i was told not to worry and i managed to convince them to lay down their heavy artillery and make do with light weaponry

5046880 so far the knee is good and well make a decision tomorrow
5046881 im very happy definitely happy and the only thing left is do whatever i can to help the team
5046882 ill just have to try and see what happens but im sure ill be able to help the team
5046883 i had some doubts as far as the surgery but as far as making the decision to try and make it back i had no doubts
5046884 theyre shiftless anyway they nascar just need to do something
5046885 that was a really poor and foolish decision on the part of our key guys
5046886 a couple of guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us to me the frustrating part is why
5046887 i know theyre probably frustrated from the standpoint of wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and wanting it to look like were handicapped even more than we actually were i understand that but thats not an excuse
5046888 if this alleged incident proves true it goes against everything we stand for as an organization
5046889 we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us
5046890 the expectations we set for everyone at joe gibbs racing begins with me and i personally apologize to nascar our partners and our fans for the negative light this situation has cast upon all of us
5046891 i found out about it halfway through the day session last night when i went over there to see what was going on
5046892 i was surprised to see what was happening and astonished and frankly incredulous i couldnt believe it was happening because its clearly defined in the entry forms that you dont do this sort of thing
5046893 but im sure joe and j d will take care of that internally and whatever fans think theyre going to think were just going to keep working on our stuff
5046894 we kind of feel like in the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor if you win that engine dyno good for you
5046895 thats how weve felt the last few years the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped and then win it again thats awesome thats a great story so that wasnt able to be told so now were sitting here going over this issue
5046896 that would seem to me like it would be actions that are extremely detrimental to stock car racing if theyre going to make decisions based on parity after theyve given them what theyve given them with regard to the parameters on their engine based on flawed data due to the spacer that certainly is detrimental to my interest
5046897 well get together our groups back in concord n c and daytona beach and discuss whats next i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5046898 we historically dont make our decisions on penalties within a 24 hour period it takes time to get everybody in a group and talk about it the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno in the end we got what we needed to
5046899 they got their advantage when people get an advantage they dont want to give it up
5046900 sometimes they go to extremes to keep from giving up the advantage thats just what they did
5046901 like everything we do theres a lot of opportunity for things to happen and many times its just different circumstances that come up
5046902 nascars got a real problem figuring out what they want to do
5046903 first of all they gave toyota too much which they shouldnt have done it wasnt fair for them to give toyota folks the expectation they could keep that advantage and now that theyve done it it isnt fair to let them keep the advantage
5046904 for someone to try to go around that amp certainly nascars got a huge problem and well be watching to see what they do with it
5046905 im surprised its a little bit late for a trade
5046906 but for me i passed my best times in this organization
5046907 sometimes guys just have off years i think that happens its a part of the game hes certainly healthy and i think a change of scenery will help him
5046908 i think going to a pennant race will help him
5046909 i cant say enough good things about luis he took the ball for us anytime he was asked and did a phenomenal job his entire career hell be missed
5046910 theyre fighting for first place so im going to do my best to clear my mind and try to help the bullpen
5046911 he attacked the hitters i kind of expect the same thing plus hes experienced thats important
5046912 he had requested to be traded this year throughout the year
5046913 we attempted to do so by the trade deadline and just were not able to make a deal that made sense for us with a month and a half left before free agency we felt we needed to get something for him
5046914 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5046915 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5046916 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5046917 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5046918 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5046919 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5046920 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5046923 the best executive is one who has sense enough to pick good people to do what he wants them to do and self restraint enough to keep from meddling with them while they do it
5046924 there is a manager in our business who is excellent at what he does but whose style often causes problems for colleagues who complain that he pontificates and talks down to people is compulsive about everything only being done his way and gets exasperated with people who dont immediately understand things the way he sees them how can we turn this situation around before he completely disenfranchises the team or we lose talented people whove said they cant stand working with or for him
5046925 i dont want to be the vice president i am not going to be the nominee
5046926 but the flip side of all that is i was becoming very unhappy there we were hired because of who we were on the independents and that sure wasnt what we were allowed to be on t v the goofy guys you saw on there just wasnt who we were and with a gimmick like that i knew it was going to be hard to step out from that shadow and be taken seriously and we werent also after monday night i knew the writing was on the wall i hadnt been in a ring for seven months and the match we did seemed like a swansong to us both
5046927 but bond ashley olsen photos amp pics has mary kate ashley actually gained some
5046928 gm is on the highway to hell there is no signal there is a way out for them
5046929 trading of recovery swaps on gm has picked up especially over last couple of weeks
5046930 recoveries tend to be lower in recessions largely because there are more defaults
5046931 with more defaults there are more companies trying to sell assets to work their way out of difficulty with so many assets up for sale the price of those assets tends to be driven down
5046932 although there is bad inflation news around there isnt much the bank of england can do it is too late
5046933 but if they look ahead to late 2009 the impact of the oil increase on the indices will be replaced by the impact of the oil price coming down you will get a very low inflation figure in autumn 2009 it isnt inconceivable that it will go beneath 1 per cent
5046934 although the inflation figures were bad the next move in interest rates should be down at the moment the money numbers are very worrying there is undoubtedly a corporate liquidity squeeze
5046935 the sharp decline in growth rates corroborates the message from the banks credit conditions survey and elsewhere that a marked tightening in the supply of money and credit is under way as financial institutions deleverage
5046936 the mpc will continue to monitor developments in money and credit growth closely
5046937 people are concerned about whether theres a bailout thats going to be coming from the u s so it would be logical to see foreign investors pull out of agency paper
5046938 they dont know whether the u s is going to be committed to supporting the gses and if they are going to support them by what methods are they going to support them
5046939 most fixed income investors to whom we have spoken believe that a capital infusion by the government into freddie and fannie is a prerequisite for turning sentiment around in mortgage backed securities and by extension in the broader fixed income markets
5046940 the longer the debate drags on the more tentative foreign interest in the sector is likely to become even though the gses are adequately capitalized investor confidence has been shaken
5046941 a slowdown in international investor interest remains the major risk factor for agency spreads in our view
5046942 were likely to see renewed flows into treasuries and perhaps some high quality u s corporates
5046943 it would take something dramatic for there to be a material improvement in the confidence necessary to bring foreign investment back to these agencies at the levels weve become used to
5046944 there is the hope thats held out by some for a magic bullet and that could take the form of a sizable infusion of capital or perhaps a complete rethink of restructuring both of these gses
5046945 if not the cash injection then we need an overhaul
5046946 the economy as a whole is in fairly poor shape
5046947 there is growing pent up demand from those who have postponed buying during the past almost three years
5046948 the sad reality is that no one expects good news on the housing market
5046949 ongoing need to pare back construction activity in light of bloated inventories of homes on the market
5046950 we still believe it will take another year before we see a positive contribution to overall economic growth from the residential construction sector
5046951 the press is likely to dig deeply into the speech for headlines
5046952 we do not expect bernanke to signal a change in the feds policy bias
5046953 the fed is firmly on hold as it worries about both high inflation and weak growth
5046954 by the time you foreclose on my house ill be dead
5046955 our experts say this is being driven by economic hardship and uncertain times
5046956 colorado real estate was going so well and they got into a home they just didnt belong in
5046957 their lifestyle went from living the good life living the dream to just depression theyre still kind of struggling with that but we kind of lost touch because they no longer have an account with us
5046958 hes just under water and hes just going to let the thing go under foreclosure hes not broke but because of the stress he lost his job too
5046959 times like this while difficult can offer opportunities to take stock of your current situation and make needed changes
5046960 sometimes having a dream like that can offset the depression and frustration you feel with something else
5046961 and if you can take comfort youre in good company youve got multimillionaires who are foreclosed on and youve got some real life folks
5046962 its hard to judge where prices may go we are in a period where prices are adjusting to new levels buyers and sellers are struggling to find out what that new level is the market will determine it not us or the government once we have reached that level then prices should normalise but that does not mean back to levels seen early last year that were clearly excessive
5046963 funding is not something the central bank can supply it would be a very dangerous move to move to a situation where the government saw its major role as guaranteeing lending
5046964 why should the taxpayer take on the risk of borrowing by individual borrowers some of whom are risky its the lenders who should take on the risk pretending theres a magic solution is not the answer
5046965 the bank cant provide funding to finance investment that has to come from mobilising savings in the economy at home or abroad to fund investment thats what the financial sector is there to do
5046966 i may yet recommend that the government should not intervene in the market on the grounds that such intervention would create more problems than it would solve
5046967 its the riskier borrowers who are finding it more expensive
5046968 thats where the credit crunch is hitting it hasnt had an enormous impact on those people who are much safer borrowers thats what you would expect
5046969 we are moving from the imprudent period of excessive lending back to a period now of much more cautious lending
5046970 there are a lot of folks who want to get a divorce and the house is an impediment because nobody wants it
5046971 one of the ways they pay their legal fees is by selling or refinancing their home and selling the home is getting more difficult
5046972 its in inventory with homes that are just like it
5046973 a lot of times both of them cannot agree on what to do
5046974 it can be a huge financial mess in the past a lot of times folks wanted to keep the house and lately thats not the case

5046977 im not someone who sees things in a bleak way
5046978 i think perhaps we will need a stiff drink after that
5046979 i have in the last few months become more pessimistic than the consensus
5046980 im not someone who sees things in a bleak way
5046981 i have more concerns about potential risks and vulnerabilities than most people
5046982 its a mix of skills that rarely comes packaged in one person
5046983 im drawing on 20 years of accumulated experience using models
5046984 nouriel has a different way of seeing things than most economists he gets into everything
5046985 the most brilliant economist who never wrote down an equation
5046986 were in uncharted territory where standard economic theory isnt helpful
5046987 if the underlying conditions call for optimism nouriel would be optimistic
5046988 im not comfortable saying that were going to end up in the great depression
5046989 we are in a recession and denying it is nonsense
5046990 you either nationalize the banks or you nationalize the mortgages
5046991 the silent reflection makes it poetic what you take away from the experience is important

5046996 if weapons which the german government has not approved for export now appear someplace we have to assume they have been illegally exported
5046997 it doesnt matter how these weapons landed in georgia whether they were illegally exported from germany whether a licensed exporter violated german laws or whether a recipient of the weapons who acquired them legally in germany further exported them
5046998 in any case the incident shows that theres a problem with the monitoring of germanys arms export regulations and the monitoring of the final destination of such weapons

5047020 before the invasion of west beirut and the assault on the druze mountain hezbollahs telecommunications systems were up and running and fully operational in half of lebanon
5047021 following the political victory of hezbollah in doha and the surrender of the lebanese first cabinet of seniora and the march 14 coalition to the syrian iranian agenda hezbollahs tc system not only survived but we believe was extended and expanded
5047022 reports about this have been limited because journalists either dont fully recognize the strategic significance or they are afraid of hezbollah
5047023 almost no western journalists have reported this and only a few lebanese have
5047024 hezbollah is establishing layered defenses north of the litani in the southern and central bekaa and they have reinforced their presence in southern beirut
5047025 they also have created new positions in mount lebanon and in the far north near the highest peak of the cedars mountains which means technically hezbollah which means iran controls the highest ground in the region south of turkey
5047026 hezbollah knows that he who controls the mountains consequently the mountain passes controls all of lebanon
5047027 hezbollah is also telling itself i am afraid the israelis will attack me north of the litani so i will strengthen those positions above the litani and i am not allowed to have my weapons and missiles south of the litani so i will move them north
5047028 hezbollah today is five times more capable militarily than it was during the july 2006 war

5047091 since this problem with falun gong was brought up in boston two years ago the transplant society has become very active especially through president nicholas tilney and dr francis delmonico who is in charge of international affairs for tts he is also the representative of tts at the world health organisation who since boston when the society started to take all these actions i dont think there is any doubt that every doctor who is here knows that this is happening and has a very clear opinion about it no question no question
5047092 among the different actions that tts took to address this problem dr tilney and dr delmonico made several visits to china they sat down with the heath authorities in china the ministry of heath in china promised they would change this policy of using organ from executed prisoners
5047093 besides that tts organised a huge meeting in istanbul a couple of months ago the whole science community and who generated what we called the istanbul declaration which addresses all the problems not only from the executed prisoners but anything related to organ sale transplant tourism and to organ trafficking so the whole problem has been addressed and who has taken this as an official opinion of the transplant community of the world 152 countries were represented at this meeting and the declaration is already official
5047094 tomorrow there is a complete session here the early morning session is about the istanbul declaration so the whole transplant community knows and learns what the position of tts is addressing your problem and the problem of many other countries
5047095 there are a couple of countries in the world who are special buyers of these organs so i think tts as a scientific society has taken a very clear stand in addressing the problem
5047096 it has already been brought to the world this is the official statement which urges every member and every country to follow these rules to stop all these kind of practices
5047097 well it is officially known that this problem exists in china especially this situation of executed prisoners i think it is almost unique to china i dont think but i dont know if this is a practice in other parts of the world but it is condemnable of course and society has taken a very clear stand

5047118 we accomplished that mission and it will continue in another medium
5047119 were thrilled quite frankly it played out exactly how we hoped
5047120 you never can predict how somethings going to do but we felt that the movie is so strong we just needed to get it out there
5047121 the goal was to start sectarian violence with the car bombs
5047122 there used to be a whole brigade here and now its less soon these policies will backfire in tal afar and allow terrorists to come in
5047123 we used to depend mostly on coalition forces but unfortunately the footprint of the u s has been reduced
5047124 frankly we dont trust the iraqi police one hundred percent
5047125 when the aug 8 bomb went off in tal afar the police joined with the civilians to attack sunnis when we didnt join the fight they called us terrorists
5047126 as the iraqi units stood up over the past 18 months they took over our bases
5047127 we confirmed that they could operate in company and battalion strength
5047128 security forces want to focus on the true fight right now but they are forced into a two front war to stop reprisals in the population
5047129 we have been under siege for the last two years
5047130 the only thing left is for them to invade and kill us
5047131 the cease fire that was negotiated through egypt was very specific that the hamas movement and the other terrorist groups cant use it as a period to import more weapons more explosives more rockets into the gaza strip
5047132 the right to act if need be to protect ourselves we dont want this current quiet just to be the quiet before the storm
5047133 we have been under siege for the last two years
5047134 the only thing left is for them to invade and kill us

5047136 i should stress this isnt part of our strategy at the moment
5047137 this is one individuals action which he did off his own back but which we support in terms of direct action we will support people this one well one of our activist coordinators only heard about it last night but provided its non violent direct action well support it
5047138 at the moment we give people an outlet for their frustration
5047139 these arent stunts these are emergency calls this is us sounding the alarm about something everyone is aware of family breakdown mass fatherlessness is a problem in this country but politicians dont seem to recognise it
5047140 people were caught in traffic for 90 minutes thats a click of the fingers compared to a man separated from his kids for a week a month a year

5047144 the largest constituency of floating voters is single mothers and women i mean the swing from when gordon brown was popular to when he wasnt was six per cent among men but 40 per cent among women look at what that did to him
5047145 all the main parties toe the line on this we wont solve it unless we keep up the pressure even if traffic disruption is not a current fathers 4 justice strategy
5047146 i thought we were well in the game and when we got back on level terms i felt that we were in the ascendency and that we were going to go on from that
5047147 unfortunately we invited pressure on ourselves made poor decisions in key areas and were not able to recover all the hard work evaporated in those eight minutes and the game went away from us
5047148 i think people saw an improvement you have to sustain a performance from the first minute to the last we didnt so for an eight minute spell and it has cost us the game thats the level we play at you are up against good strikers and a lapse will cost you
5047149 i dont think the scoreline is a reflection on how we played it hurts at the moment but we will pick ourselves up for a big game next weekend unfortunately everybody is flying off for internationals but we will get the group back on thursday and work on the issues that came out of today

5047168 thanks to all the wonderful media and press in the maryland region we are hopeful that tomorrow nights fashion spectacular will be a success for echelon life
5047169 sooner or later our president is going to say or do something that goes too far and then it will start
5047170 by putting her name in nomination youre putting people on the spot
5047171 having a roll call just chews into your broadcast time
5047172 i believe there are a lot of supporters for hillary among the superdelegates especially now that theyve agreed to place her name in nomination i think half the house democrats would probably be hillary supporters especially women i felt she was the most experienced and the best candidate and i still feel that way
5047173 it could backfire and show that her influence is waning chances are shes not going to have as many delegates vote for her on the floor as she had in the primary
5047174 i think that most superdelegates including myself are going for obama
5047175 i made my decision for obama and im not switching again
5047176 my boss is totally conflicted about it and pissed hillary is putting us in this position
5047177 we still havent made up our mind and i dont know when we are going to
5047178 we write a lot of java so you dont have to
5047179 theres way too much for me to cover in the time left what do you want to see
5047180 what they are trying to do is strap a rocket to the ass of a turtle what they are actually doing is putting chains on the rabbits than can go fast
5047181 bad developers will move heaven and earth to do the wrong thing
5047182 how much of your enterprise software simple services accidental complexity
5047183 its ok for your test to be moist not drenched
5047184 nowhere in my best dreams i can imagine something like what i did this year
5047185 i know how difficult it is to win these things and especially here because you only have one chance every four years
5047186 the reason probably i won this title is because i have a fantastic time here enjoying a lot in the village that was amazing experience for me always was a pleasure to know new people no
5047187 its unbelievable for me this is the best moment in my career ill never forget it
5047188 it does mean more for me to win it with serena to share this kind of moment with your sister
5047189 to serve you have to push yourself up to jump up and when the legs are a little bit slow it just doesnt go
5047190 i think hes acknowledged that military action in this particular situation is unlikely but as commander in chief he wants to make sure all options remain available to him and thats understandable
5047191 and one of the questions this crisis raises is who do you want sitting across the table from vladimir putin and people like him john mccain or senator obama
5047192 as you saw with the surge and as you see even before this crisis broke out he said last year weve got a problem we should be thinking about having russia be disinvited from the g 8
5047193 if we were georgians and the russians were invading our country and killing our people wed be in a state of war
5047194 i think barack obama has consistently demonstrated superior judgment to senator mccain on a whole host of national security issues
5047195 whether to go into iraq or not barack obama was correct how to get out of iraq the iraqis embrace barack obamas position even george bush is coming around
5047196 he was right about afghanistan finally john mccain is coming around on that he was right about engaging iran george bush has come around on that and he was right about georgia months ago he was calling for this conflict to be diffused instead the president and john mccain are so obsessed with iraq we dropped the ball if wed listened to senator obama and his judgment perhaps we wouldnt be here today
5047197 the surge has been singularly or at least very predominantly one of the main reasons for the turnaround in the war
5047198 senator mccain saw that the need for it because of his judgment his experience and wisdom senator obama to this day to this day denies the value and the strategic benefit of the surge thats a startling lack of judgment in my view
5047199 barack obama has consistently demonstrated the kind of judgment that we want in a commander in chief
5047200 hes strong hes cool hes smart thats what we need in these difficult times
5047201 the problem is first of all that the russian president has given his word several times and its not been honored by russian troops so i assume that this time russian forces are indeed going to withdraw
5047202 president bush has offered an opportunity for russia to behave as a partner offered an opportunity for russia to make a strategic choice in favor of integration into the international economic political diplomatic security structures made an opportunity for russia to finally act like a 21st century modern power
5047203 and i do think that russian behavior calls seriously into question whether russia is prepared to make that choice
5047204 in fact russia seems to want to have it both ways it wants to be part of these institutions that are so essential to the international economy and the international order and on the other hand it wants to engage in kind of soviet style behavior of intimidating and invading allies or neighbors both cant be true
5047205 all the united states has done is encouraged democratic government in georgia encouraged market based economic reforms encouraged fight against corruption and encouraged the georgians to look towards the modern institutions of the west
5047206 the united states and georgia have had a very good relationship this is a pro western pro european government that wants to be a part of those institutions
5047207 as to this particular conflict we have encouraged georgians and all parties to resolve this conflict in south ossetia and abkhazia peacefully we have supported peace plans we have supported diplomacy we have told all parties not to get involved in military conflict
5047208 georgia of course has been a state that has been westward looking has been a friend of ours we have indicated to them through cultural exchanges and other exchanges that we want to be supportive of them
5047209 but i havent seen any evidence that the united states of america has overpromised and when you look at the reactions of the two candidates senator mccain senator obama senator mccain came out saying you know this really is bullying behavior by russia against one of our friends the state of georgia senator obamas statement came out and essentially implied that were going to equally blame our friend georgia and russia and then he revised his statement two or three times but again it shows a lack of surefootedness by senator obama
5047210 let us not forget that barack obama has been calling for a resolution of these disputes for many many months now long before hostilities broke out
5047211 if we followed his advice perhaps we wouldnt be talking about this here today if the president and senator mccain werent so obsessed on an open ended commitment to iraq perhaps we would have paid greater attention to some of these issues
5047212 reading sarcasm is not that hard it just requires reading comprehension skills

5047216 reading sarcasm is not that hard it just requires reading comprehension skills
5047217 i would so suck my own balls for a box of pocky
5047218 you know hes got a longer track record than that
5047219 one of the things i think we have to unify the country around is having an intelligent energy policy thats what were going to be talking about

5047221 younger children seem more interested in setting short term goals for their learning in the game compared to older children who are more interested in simply playing and the actions of playing
5047222 thus younger children may show a greater need for focusing on small aspects of a given problem than older children even in a leisure based situation such as playing video games
5047223 the big picture is that there are several dimensions on which games have effects including the amount they are played the content of each game what you have to pay attention to on the screen and how you control the motions
5047224 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could
5047225 these forums illustrate how sophisticated intellectual practices to improve game play mimic actual scientific reasoning
5047226 gamers are openly discussing their strategies and thinking creating an environment in which informal scientific reasoning practices are being learned by playing these online video games

5047256 lets just say that there is a lot more concerning obama in indonesia information involving obama and others that should be instrumental in ensuring that he never sees the white house
5047257 there is a mood in the country that just wants the business broken up
5047258 were waiting until the provisional report comes out this week on remedies before make any further comment on how this will affect us

5047268 so its okay for china to shoot dissidents in cold blood and build a firewall out their country that shields their citizens from such undesirable ideas as democracy and free speech

5047270 it was scary because they at the american embassy in chengdu warned me if i was low profile now i will be high profile and i will be followed once i enter tibetan regions
5047271 cable one customers opted in to our monitoring of their internet usage and content consistent with this third party test when they agreed to our aup
5047272 because doing so would stifle our ability to test new technologies that have the potential to offer significant benefits to our customers
5047273 a comprehensive federal privacy law that would accomplish several goals such as building consumer trust and protections
5047274 approached by a third party vendor about a new technology that replaces existing online advertisements with advertisements of greater relevance to users based on anonymized data collected about certain commercial categories of interest
5047275 but at the very least the service has to be consumer opt in you have to have complete consumer control including opt in and full disclosure of whats being collected and how its being used
5047276 what is now seen as a predominantly younger pastime will spread to encompass a wider group of people in part due to the aging of current online video viewers but also as a result of word of mouth spread of services growth of in home networks and new network connected consumer electronic devices
5047277 the survey data in a recent in stat report indicates that over half of consumers actually still prefer packaged goods which bodes well for blu ray discs surprisingly younger people who regularly watch online were the group that expressed the highest interest in owning a package goods bundle that includes artwork and extra content
5047278 the instances of applicants securing jobs giving false information is not new but the situation has now reached new heights in the it sector which has forced the leading it firms like tcs satyam cognizant and others to take a tough stand
5047279 life is not measured by the number of breaths we take but by the moments that take our breath away
5047280 life is what happens to you while youre busy making other plans
5047281 as counterintuitive as it sounds the surest way to lose customers is to give them too many choices people are inundated with decision making responsibilities think about your own life every single day youre faced with literally hundreds of personal and professional decisions take a walk through your local grocery store and if your choice of cereals shampoos sodas detergents and breads dont approach a thousand different options then youre living in the wrong neighborhood

5047289 well there is a cease fire and russia is currently not in compliance with that cease fire although they have just this morning announced that their troops will begin to withdraw and withdraw fully and completely back to the lines prior to this conflict tomorrow on monday
5047290 in fact the fact that russian troops are in georgian cities the fact that they are at the port of poti back and forth in that port along the east west highway is simply not acceptable and it has nothing to do obviously with the conflict that began in south ossetia thats why russian troops need to withdraw fully completely back to their aug t 6 7 lines
5047291 foi uma demonstra o dirigida a todos os que consideram que a r ssia pode ser ignorada

5047298 i see youre here for the kucinich vice presidential announcement
5047299 well we may make news this morning bob but it is not going to be that so i hate to disappoint you but nothing to report today
5047300 if people are voting on experience theyre not voting for obama he should be change he should be bringing new people to washington i think governor kaine is the strongest pick and i think he will be the pick
5047301 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states i think thats the responsibility of the vice president if youre unwilling or unable to do that then i think you should defer to someone else
5047302 im certainly not going to be arguing with anybody about their perspective on that regard nor am i going to give advice to john mccain as to who he ought to choose
5047303 but lets go back to this issue about whats needed right now in the country is it judgment or experience and i frankly think that judgment comes from experience i think people who are wise and have great judgment are people who have experienced the world and understand how the world works
5047304 will convene again just to deal with the situation of zimbabwe
5047305 this is an issue that is not on the table
5047306 everyone knows that we disagreed with his decision in terms of the state of emergency that he declared but he was he kept to his word he took off the uniform theres now a democratic government in pakistan
5047307 president mahmoud ahmadinejad was at the lanch of the communications satellite omid hope from irans space station
5047308 the second launch of the safir ambassador rocket carrying the first satellite omid was conducted successfully
5047309 the achievement has drawn much attention from around the world especially from among muslim nations as iran is under heavy sanctions by the west and the un security council making it develop the technology and build every part and equipment needed in the field of aerospace
5047310 this satellite the rocket and the launch station are entirely iranian built achieved by particularly talented scientists and technicians
5047311 we will work on accomplishing it within the coming weeks
5047312 the court still has jurisdiction to proceed with the case and there is no reason to dismiss the case
5047313 i think hes acknowledged that military action in this particular situation is unlikely but as commander in chief he wants to make sure all options remain available to him and thats understandable
5047314 and one of the questions this crisis raises is who do you want sitting across the table from vladimir putin and people like him john mccain or senator obama
5047315 as you saw with the surge and as you see even before this crisis broke out he said last year weve got a problem we should be thinking about having russia be disinvited from the g 8

5047318 whether to go into iraq or not barack obama was correct how to get out of iraq the iraqis embrace barack obamas position even george bush is coming around
5047319 he was right about afghanistan finally john mccain is coming around on that he was right about engaging iran george bush has come around on that and he was right about georgia months ago he was calling for this conflict to be diffused instead the president and john mccain are so obsessed with iraq we dropped the ball if wed listened to senator obama and his judgment perhaps we wouldnt be here today
5047320 the surge has been singularly or at least very predominantly one of the main reasons for the turnaround in the war
5047321 senator mccain saw that the need for it because of his judgment his experience and wisdom senator obama to this day to this day denies the value and the strategic benefit of the surge thats a startling lack of judgment in my view
5047322 barack obama has consistently demonstrated the kind of judgment that we want in a commander in chief
5047323 hes strong hes cool hes smart thats what we need in these difficult times

5047335 it is exceptional the degree to which the militarys currently relying on such contractors
5047336 were of a much smaller scale than what we are seeing in iraq
5047337 the cost of having an army contingent provide the same services as blackwater appears to be roughly the same as the cost of the contract itself
5047338 nowhere in my best dreams i can imagine something like what i did this year
5047339 i know how difficult it is to win these things and especially here because you only have one chance every four years
5047340 the reason probably i won this title is because i have a fantastic time here enjoying a lot in the village that was amazing experience for me always was a pleasure to know new people no
5047341 its unbelievable for me this is the best moment in my career ill never forget it
5047342 it does mean more for me to win it with serena to share this kind of moment with your sister
5047343 to serve you have to push yourself up to jump up and when the legs are a little bit slow it just doesnt go
5047344 the twenty million dollars is going to be a real squeaker lets face it 20 million is not really enough i knew that if i said 40 million the east coasters would go crazy or think i was
5047345 man muss abwarten der fu ist stark geschwollen auch wenn nichts gebrochen oder kaputt ist muss er mindestens vier oder f nf tage aussetzen
5047346 what would happen if something went wrong a sweaty palm slips a sense of timing fails
5047347 cable one customers opted in to our monitoring of their internet usage and content consistent with this third party test when they agreed to our aup
5047348 because doing so would stifle our ability to test new technologies that have the potential to offer significant benefits to our customers

5047373 the very expensive security systems of the facility are quite unnecessary for the population who may be detained there the damage that has been done to peoples mental and physical health by detaining them in remote high security detention centres such as this has been documented repeatedly

5047383 but for me i passed my best times in this organization
5047384 sometimes guys just have off years i think that happens its a part of the game hes certainly healthy and i think a change of scenery will help him
5047385 i think going to a pennant race will help him

5047387 theyre fighting for first place so im going to do my best to clear my mind and try to help the bullpen
5047388 he attacked the hitters i kind of expect the same thing plus hes experienced thats important
5047389 he had requested to be traded this year throughout the year
5047390 we attempted to do so by the trade deadline and just were not able to make a deal that made sense for us with a month and a half left before free agency we felt we needed to get something for him
5047391 i dont mean to be rude or offend you but i just have to tell you that you have a pretty butt
5047392 does evil exist and if so do we ignore it do we negotiate with it do we contain it or do we defeat it
5047393 now the one thing that i think is very important is for us to have some humility in how we approach the issue of confronting evil you know a lot of evil has been perpetrated based on the claim that
5047394 well its raining here and i dont want to stress my bees or make life miserable for my help
5047395 if you take bees to cotton in texas youll have high losses down the line if you leave them in the woods and they dont get into cotton theyll do fine the same thing with citrus in the southeast apples in the north east

5047401 this is the first time anyone has done really fundamental hands on quantum mechanics with an organic led
5047402 we can convert the spin information into a current and manipulate it and change it
5047403 we are manipulating this information and reading it out again we are writing it and reading it
5047404 even the smallest transistor today consists of hundreds of thousands of atoms
5047405 the ultimate goal of miniaturization is to implement electronics on the scale of atoms and electrons
5047406 just like a mass on a spring the pulse produces an oscillation of the spins of singlets and triplets in the organic led

5047421 i believe in that jesus christ died for my sins and that i am redeemed through him that is a source of strength and sustenance on a daily basis i know that i dont walk alone and i know if i can get myself out of the way that i can maybe carry out in some small way what he intends and it means that those sins that i have on a fairly regular basis hopefully will be washed away
5047422 jesus christ died for my sins and that i am redeemed through him
5047423 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
5047424 i think that whether youre looking it from a theological perspective of a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5047425 i believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman big applause now for me as a christian its also a sacred union now gods in the mix applause im not somebody who promotes same sex marriage but i do believe in civil unions i think my faith is strong enough and my marriage is strong enough that i can afford those civil rights to others if i have a different perspective or a different view applause
5047426 recent polls says 80 of americans thing faith based organizations do a better job with community services than the government applause good thing
5047427 what we do want to make sure of is that as a general were not using federal funding to discriminate but that is only when it comes to the narrow program that is being funded by the federal government that does not affect any of the other ministries that are taking place
5047428 im not suggesting that everybody whos making over 250 000 is living on easy street
5047429 washington is so broken that we cant seem to bring together people of good will to solve these common problems
5047430 if youre a person of faith like me i believe that things garbled work out and well get the president that we need
5047431 at the moment of conception i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5047432 a union between man and woman between one man and one woman

5047437 its remarkable the ability that our enemies have to communicate so we have to keep up with that capability i mean theres too many ways through cyberspace and through other ways that people are able to communicate with one another so were going to have to step up our capabilities to monitor those
5047438 we are without a doubt the most blessed nation in the world we are blessed to be a blessing
5047439 the women are taking charge of the future of rwanda because theyre saying never again and theyre doing an incredible job
5047440 a great little nation its a beautiful little country theyre wonderful people
5047441 we must respect the entire integ territory of russia excuse me of the russians must respect the entire territorial integrity of georgia
5047442 when i go to gees bend alabama and meet the african american women there who are so wonderful and lovely
5047443 its a sad day in this country when one of our most important and influential groups is held up to ridicule each of us here has devoted countless hours to the craft of acting and we feel we have earned the right to be able to belittle and denigrate those who we work with on a daily basis i mean if the key grip or the best boy or even the director for that matter want their bling h20 chilled to a proper 38 degrees then let them pay their dues on the this side of the camera the side that counts
5047444 the crews are filled with whiners and i have no patience for it
5047445 i think john mccains reaction to what happened in russia did not reflect well on the position he should have taken and that is one of understanding we have one president in this country and that secretary of state rice and president bush need the support of both presidential candidates in a very tricky time as it relates to russia and the neighboring states that are trying to establish democracies
5047446 i think him doing press releases and sending some of his political allies to georgia i think some of it began to ring like a political campaign instead of principled and strong diplomacy
5047447 they accused barack obama of being presumptuous for going to europe and meeting with our allies
5047448 what is presumptuous is to try to undercut in any way the very difficult and tricky work that president bush and secretary rice are trying to do right now

5047450 the delinquency level in these pools is more than expected leading to significant utilisation of credit enhancement
5047451 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5047452 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5047453 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5047454 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5047455 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5047456 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5047457 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5047458 i thought we were well in the game and when we got back on level terms i felt that we were in the ascendency and that we were going to go on from that
5047459 unfortunately we invited pressure on ourselves made poor decisions in key areas and were not able to recover all the hard work evaporated in those eight minutes and the game went away from us
5047460 i think people saw an improvement you have to sustain a performance from the first minute to the last we didnt so for an eight minute spell and it has cost us the game thats the level we play at you are up against good strikers and a lapse will cost you
5047461 i dont think the scoreline is a reflection on how we played it hurts at the moment but we will pick ourselves up for a big game next weekend unfortunately everybody is flying off for internationals but we will get the group back on thursday and work on the issues that came out of today
5047462 we saw a lot of road kill and thought of you
5047463 it was subsequently revealed that the bryce committee did not personally interview a single witness relying instead on hearsay evidence and depositions given without oaths a belgian commission of enquiry in 1922 failed to corroborate a single major allegation in the bryce report
5047464 god will save her fear you not be you the men youve been
5047465 there would have been no war propaganda without the war no atrocity stories without atrocities although the entente press wildly exagerrated what went on in belgium there is no question that the german army did commit atrocities there in 1914 according to evidence from the diaries of german soldiers and other reliable sources all the advancing german armies executed civilians including women and priests altogether about 5 500 belgian civilians were deliberately killed by the german army most of them in the eleven day period from 18 14th august 1914 and at least another 500 in france the germans also used civilians as human shields and razed numerous villages to the ground in one case an eighteen year old girl was bayonnetted to death there were also numerous rapes in occupied france
5047466 with the fall in oil and other commodity prices in the past month both the markets and fed officials had started to turn away from inflation risks and focus on growth risks
5047467 the view which we agree with is that with the usual long and variable lags falling commodity prices and rising unemployment will drive down inflation no need for the fed to get its hands dirty when the housing and
5047468 the markets are in such a forgiving mood that both the stock and rallied on thursday despite what can only be described as an ugly cpi report
5047469 the biggest problem remains the housing market and its negative impacts on the financial sector

5047473 i mean we just visited the anime convention last year what purpose do we have in coming yet again
5047474 last year was a bit of a farce months of waiting which amounted to a measly four hours of convention time hardly enough to catch music videos and browse the marketplace this year the family gave me the whole day off to geek out
5047475 fine for you maybe but what am i doing here besides inhaling geek funk oh terrific
5047476 because youre a good friend who rejoices in my happiness

5047479 okay i can accept that your camera does take movies right
5047480 um well last year we came home with lots of stuff
5047481 speak for yourself i came home with a bad rash and five hours lost which could have been better spent watching ramseys kitchen nightmares
5047482 well this year i wanted to maybe buy some artbooks and maybe if its not too expensive a figure
5047483 no specific one in mind maybe fate stay night or melancholy of haruhi suzuhima or anyone that looks good

5047485 i cant even recognize half these characters the dragonball and naruto guys sure but what about that guy with the blue hair

5047497 yes the paper has been held up by many as a very conservative paper it serves a conservative audience
5047498 several in attendance reported to me that sen lindsey graham seriously asked if social conservatives would support a vice president who favors abortion on demand they were shocked the question even had to be asked and alienated that the mccain campaign appears to be even considering it
5047499 ive almost been ignoring my own feelings because i figured they pale in comparison to how hard this entire process has been for him but i am heartbroken right now
5047500 gay people have been abused really by the church and just mindlessly suggesting that they go back is like telling an abused spouse to go back to her husband
5047501 it s because people get to know us better find out so much more information about us giving us more exposure readers feel like they have a connection to us personally

5047507 with both young and adult gamers as loyal fans the legend of zelda is one of the most beloved video game series ever created the contributors to this volume consider the following questions and more what is the nature of the gamers connection to link does link have a will or do gamers project their wills onto him how does the gamer experience the game do the rules of logic apply in the game world how is space created and distributed in hyrule the fictional land in which the game takes place how does time function is zelda art can hyrule be seen as an ideal society can the game be enjoyable without winning the legend of zelda and philosophy not only appeals to zelda fans and philosophers but also puts video games on the philosophical map as a serious area of study
5047508 some poems dont rhyme and some stories dont have a clear beginning middle and end life is about not knowing having to change taking the moment and making the best of it without knowing whats going to happen next
5047509 if she had accepted what was on the table she would have been hailed as a hero
5047510 what we brought back to her from him was what we thought she would accept
5047511 as i look back she managed us very carefully then when she got with the lawyers it was a whole different deal
5047512 but we are learned people people who are respected and we came away from that meeting and subsequent phone contacts believing that what we said to the mayor was what shed require
5047513 i believe that the mayor has accepted responsibility for the things that he is able to or that he feels he is guilty of doing
5047514 i think he has accepted those responsibilities for things he thinks hes wrong in
5047515 i think that prosecutor worthy is in a very unique position because right now we need some leadership to be displayed that is willing to heal our community
5047516 our community is being torn apart weve got families that are divided on this issue and churches that are divided
5047517 the nations largest african american electoral base has reached a state of paralysis it has come to a point where the mayors personal problems are overshadowing anything he has to say regarding the city we have long resisted calls and other requests to urge detroit mayor kwame kilpatrick to resign because of his mountainous legal troubles but no more
5047518 birds would never learn to fly if mama did not boot them out of the nest usually from a tree and sometimes they cling to the branch so tenaciously that mama has to peck at their little claws until they release and flap their wings
5047519 what really needs to happen is to somehow get past this
5047520 im the pastor of the mayor i am his shepherd and a shepherd is supposed to protect his sheep
5047521 were not asking that the mayor not receive any punishment if hes wrong however we dont want to kill him we want him to live and work and provide for his family it just seems to me that that shouldnt be hard for us to do
5047522 i enjoyed the opportunity to meet senator obama and discuss an issue that is americas top priority which is ending our dependence on foreign oil that today is approaching 70 percent of our imports and is costing us
5047523 i assured senator obama that this is a non partisan campaign and that i will do everything in my power to work together with leaders who are willing to solve our immense energy problems which are ruining our economy and threatening our national security
5047524 as i did with senator mccain on friday i stressed the urgency of the situation and the need to end the largest transfer of wealth in human history
5047525 we discussed my plan and the opportunities to create jobs grow our economy and revitalize americas heartland by using private capital to invest in renewable energy including wind and solar power that are among our most abundant and untapped natural resources
5047526 we also discussed the pickens plans success and our efforts to get more than one million supporters
5047527 it would be inappropriate for me to speak for senator obama i have a real sense however that he was very engaged he understands the issues and is interested and excited by the work we are doing to educate and involve the people of this great nation as with any leader he knows that developing real energy policy that will transform america for the better requires change and that change happens not just from the top down but from the bottom up and thats what we are doing with the pickens plan
5047528 we have to take a lot of credit for the result here today
5047529 its a huge result for us and by going to the champions we knew it was going to be tough well take a lot of positives

5047537 these are people who make it possible for us to eat everyday
5047538 human culture as we have known it for the past 200 years is drawing to a close a revolution of civilization is upon us prepare
5047539 the most significant characteristic of modern civilization is the sacrifice of the future for the present and all the power of science has been prostituted to this purpose
5047540 nobody made a greater mistake than he who did nothing because he could only do a little

5047546 you are correct in identifying the shrinking of humanitarian space and the problems of confusions between the military and humanitarian purposes of foreigners who are here

5047551 we do know that genocide is happening in x african nation but we cant afford to provide or just arent interested in providing assistance because we really need to focus on nations that have something to do with our national security interests
5047552 well give you just enough infrastructure to keep you from revolting but the rest is going into our pockets and the pockets of our friends because thats just the way it works
5047553 we are controlling the media and suspending your constitutional rights so that we can control the entire spectrum of dissent from terrorist to peace activist because it helps us get these things done more efficiently and without penalty
5047554 three things in human life are important the first is to be kind the second is to be kind and the third is to be kind

5047655 nous coordonnons nos efforts avec le premier ministre gyptien ahmad nazif et les ministres concern s en egypte afin de permettre l lectricit et au gaz gyptiens darriver au liban aussi vite que possible
5047656 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5047657 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5047658 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5047659 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5047660 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5047661 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5047662 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5047663 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5047664 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5047665 that fraud has increased and appraisal fraud has increased in a way to exacerbate the problems
5047666 the higher the loan amount the more money brokers and lenders make in the deal
5047667 and they threaten you they say if you dont play ball with us well go somewhere else and they do ive seen my business shrink theyre all doing it its hard to stay honest
5047668 faulty and fraudulent appraisals were an important contributor to the losses that the federal government suffered during the saving and loan crisis
5047669 we got to this point by a lack of enforcement the public has the right to expect the appraisal boards are taking care of that problem
5047670 do you know what that would have meant the net effect is it would have effectively shut down mortgage lending in that state
5047671 to take that action would have been an unbelievable disruption to the economy i wasnt going to do that
5047672 either you shut it off completely in a state or you just send letters
5047673 the threat of the atomic bomb is the only thing
5047674 they know they can keep doing what theyre doing because they can get away with it
5047675 theyre not getting punished and states arent doing more because they know regulators wont do a thing
5047676 i wasnt alone we had appraisers from all over the nation writing in and urging them to take action
5047677 resulting from inappropriate pressure being placed on real estate property appraisers to hit a certain value
5047678 people who say we should have done more dont understand how the system works
5047679 agencies just dont lobby to change things we had no interest in doing anything like that it just wasnt our area
5047680 good position to work with bank regulators and others on the problem
5047681 everything related to the issue went into a black hole why i just dont know
5047682 i tried to push but nobody wanted to hear what i was saying
5047683 problem appraisals are being allowed and in some ways even encouraged by a regulatory structure that promotes lax enforcement and ineffective oversight
5047684 we are here to alert congress that the licensing system it created for appraisers is broken and needs to be fixed
5047685 but states dont have the money to hire personnel to carry out what the system was designed to do
5047686 may have been rude or said my house wasnt worth as much as i thought
5047687 just because youre disciplined that doesnt make you a bad appraiser
5047688 i may have done some technical things wrong but ive done a good job im proud of my work
5047689 why should he get super zapped for doing a lot of little things that a lot of other appraisers are doing every day but havent had complaints turned in on them
5047690 there has to be effective enforcement of some sort there has to be reality to it
5047691 what are you going to do if there is pressure on appraisers how are you going to penalize someone who puts that pressure on appraisers whos going to do it whos going to enforce it they need to have that or it wont work
5047692 he was the fattest prisoner that got off the plane
5047693 he doesnt want to talk about how he turned in all those names
5047694 respectfully im going to disagree with you when it comes to mccain and his service i think his policies are horrible i think his service was honorable
5047695 we got a candidate for president out here with two self inflicted scratches and i take that as an insult
5047696 if you dont know what your passion is realize that one reason for your existence on earth is to find it
5047697 if you make a choice that doesnt please your mate friends or whoever the world will not fall apart
5047698 the world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page
5047699 theres a combination of reality and voyeurism that captures the imagination
5047700 if katie was this entertaining when she was actually on the air i might even watch her little newscast

5047715 wie weit sie selbst und die spd sich bereits von der lebenssituation der menschen entfernt haben wenn sie unsere positionen als weltfremd bezeichnen wir als die linke artikulieren die erwartungshaltung der benachteiligten in unserer gesellschaft

5047718 id like to see him start and finish a practice before we declare him ready to play
5047719 im just telling you where we are right now hes made tremendous strides and i would think with carnell anything is possible
5047720 he spoke to the team and got a chance to visit with a lot of the players
5047721 if you ask me and this is just my opinion he is global he is the no 1 superstar in all of sports at least on my list he hits all the shots all the time hes got complete mental control hes unbelievable and hopefully some of that rubs off on us

5047723 we get to talk to people from all over the world they actually go crazy when they see us
5047724 they cant believe this is happening in america that in a big city like fort worth theres a cowboy walking down the street or on the back of a horse
5047725 they have to stick together thats the main thing with the cattle drives
5047726 if we was trying to take two head down the street they would probably run off on us but if we take them all or eight to 10 at least theyll all stick together
5047727 another few weary steps and there was nothing above us but the sky
5047728 to this day it thrills me to know that if i can get the program right it will always work perfectly every time just the way i told it to experiencing this thrill was the beginning of my fascination with software
5047729 theres nothing like the eureka moment of discovering something that no one knew before i wont compare it to sex but it lasts longer
5047730 my feet are still on the ground im just wearing better shoes
5047731 ive read that i flew up the hills and mountains of france but you dont fly up a hill you struggle slowly and painfully and maybe if you work very hard you get to the top ahead of everybody else
5047732 what is behind it is the years of passion and dedication and hard work
5047733 being near or at the top certainly requires an enormous amount of time and effort and it doesnt come without collateral cost
5047734 its not a 9 to 5 job something elsewhere is going to have to suffer
5047735 as i stood in front of all of you for years in victory i stand in front of you today
5047736 ah how could i possibly admit such an infirmity in the one sense which should have been more perfect in me than in others
5047737 soon i would have to deal with something i had not known in my entire life pressure the pressure to defend my position the pressure to carry myself like a man and champion the pressure to meet demands and obligations that came with my new station and wealth the pressure to take on the obligations that come with being a professional anything and most demanding of all the pressure to win day after day round after round to hold my new position and potentially improve on it
5047738 let him have that monkey on his back for the next 25 30 35 years its not an easy thing
5047739 most of my friends thought i was a lot cooler i guess
5047740 it would kind of just be nice to be a regular person again
5047741 you plow ahead and make a hit and you plow on and someone passes you then someone passes them time levels
5047742 when you think of life as a living active process i dont think its a pleasurable activity unless you have some challenge in that life no matter what it is
5047743 i think in a way that is the philosophy of life
5047744 when im with a group of kids now they just yell out thats the cooking man
5047745 i walk down the streets of san francisco and every kid recognizes me and stops me and says hello you know thats really a wonderful thing
5047746 he knows how great he is but at the same time hes very humble
5047747 hes shocked to see how people still love him and remember him you see his eyes light up and it takes him back a moment when they chant ali ali its like charging a battery up
5047748 we should release the new hp movie on the same weekend only next year itll make more money kids will be out of school
5047749 running a plant day to day no matter what is challenging but we are ambitious and determined to restore it
5047750 it would be great to have the plant but have it run by a different company or a different family
5047751 theres a lot of ups and downs when you are recruiting so quickly
5047752 its a process thats evolving every day were constantly building
5047753 coming in within six weeks with enough people to get the plant to full capacity isnt a challenge its nearly impossible
5047754 i raised a fuss and i think im going to start next week
5047755 but some of those guys just got sent on a bus right back home
5047756 you see it and you are reminded of your commitment to do good
5047757 its a good way to attract families so that they can learn about you know small steps they can take to reduce their carbon footprint
5047758 weve tried to replace light bulbs we can probably encourage more recyclable materials with our vendors
5047759 because were a fair we like things bright and shiny lights running and colorful
5047760 a lot of them used to just leave them running all night because it looks nice
5047761 the rides that come in when youre talking about the types and sizes of exhibit buildings that we have it is a massive undertaking
5047762 we still had to use regular electricity to work the fans the misters to keep all the animals cool
5047763 its hard to go completely green but thats not to say that little things cant be done here or there
5047764 we found that to work better because the public doesnt necessarily know the different bins

5047770 she just said congratulations and then she started crying and i started crying and then my sister started crying we havent really had too much time together
5047771 my mums told me id better make the team because she wants to go to rome so ive got the pressure from the mum

5047800 the mere fact that a number of complaints have been filed against a person doesnt mean that all of the complaints reach the level of where there needs to be disciplinary action taken

5047803 astronomers have wondered for a quarter century whether these voids were too big or too empty to be explained by gravity alone
5047804 our analysis shows that the voids in these surveys are exactly as big and as empty as predicted by the standard theory of the universe
5047805 when we used galaxies brighter than the milky way to trace structure the biggest empty voids we found were about 75 million light years across
5047806 halos of a given mass seem to form similar galaxies both in numbers of stars and in the ages of those stars regardless of where the halos live
5047807 void statistics in large galaxy redshift surveys does halo occupation of field galaxies depend on environment
5047808 we want to make sure we have every tool available when these types of incidents occur
5047809 most of what we will bring is added resources and support that will free up the investigating agency to allocate more manpower towards the investigation
5047810 it is something that really is needed and its good training
5047811 i come across them often enough that i want to make sure i have the tools and resources
5047812 these cases dont occur every day but when they do occur you need to make sure you act quickly to ensure the best interest of the child
5047813 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop
5047814 it was magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 percent wide open
5047815 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5047816 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5047817 we historically dont make our decisions within a 24 hour period it takes time to get everybody in a group and talk about it
5047818 let me just say that first and foremost that that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys there at jgr
5047819 i want to apologize to nascar to our partners to toyota guys a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5047820 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were
5047821 for us we kind of feel like in the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and chief engine builder mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5047822 the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped to come back and win it again thats awesome
5047823 thats a great story that wasnt able to be told
5047824 well figure out exactly what happened and those that were responsible
5047825 theres going to be punishment for that thats just part of life you cant do that
5047826 i found out about it halfway through the day session last night when i went over there to see what was going on
5047827 i was surprised to see what was happening and astonished and frankly incredulous i couldnt believe it was happening because its clearly defined in the entry forms that you dont do this sort of thing
5047828 but im sure joe and j d will take care of that internally and whatever fans think theyre going to think were just going to keep working on our stuff
5047829 its not something that you like to hear about and you have to just question every chassis dyno thats ever been run on every toyota
5047830 you look at the no 32 car of brian vickers and red bull racing the 32 and the 18 and the 20 made about the same power the first run on the dyno when they took the magnet or whatever this device was out of the 18 and the 20 they both came up
5047831 what i dont know is if its a toyota problem if its a joe gibbs thing how widespread is it and how long has it been going on because a lot of whats been done by nascar has been based on the chassis dyno results
5047832 its disappointing to hear that anybody whether its a manufacturer or a team or an individual on a team would go to any length to do that
5047833 you know hes got a longer track record than that
5047834 one of the things i think we have to unify the country around is having an intelligent energy policy thats what were going to be talking about
5047835 running a plant day to day no matter what is challenging but we are ambitious and determined to restore it
5047836 it would be great to have the plant but have it run by a different company or a different family

5047840 i raised a fuss and i think im going to start next week
5047841 but some of those guys just got sent on a bus right back home
5047842 you see it and you are reminded of your commitment to do good
5047843 it is a struggle something we must deal with but with enough money and the right time and if we stay the course theres no reason we cant get there
5047844 if its something this crazy there has to be a good reason for it
5047845 for a crazy thing like that to happen two times in a row there has got to be something and im sure it will show itself with time
5047846 my first thought was thats not good i hope thats in the black i looked down and it was in the black but it was a very bad shot
5047847 i was a little bit more nervous than some of the previous shots but i was really in control i felt good about it im sure had it made it down into the it would have been a pretty good shot
5047848 ive got an olympic silver medal an olympic gold medal and i should have two more gold medals there is nothing wrong with my mind
5047849 that there are people or groups that are allegedly operating in homonhon even if there is no permit
5047850 ive heard that there was a protest rally there last week by an anti mining group
5047851 theres pressure on the hospital but we are managing the best we can
5047852 we very much regret the need to take this action but we must protect our patients from illness and not expose others to illness
5047853 we are very sorry for the inconvenience to our patients and staff
5047854 we will remove the restrictions as soon as the situation is under control
5047855 for too long cleaning has been viewed as a cost to be minimised and a substantial investment in the cleaning sector is urgently needed

5047863 nessun nuovo tributo sar introdotto tantomeno il ritorno dellici come risultato del federalismo fiscale ma ci sar la soppressione di oltre 10 tasse relativa ella casa stato regione comune e la loro sostituzione con un tributo unico proprio a vantaggio dei comuni
5047864 i cittadini ha aggiunto il leader del carroccio sono disposti a dare se le tasse vanno ai loro comuni perch vedono i risultati strade aiuole
5047865 lici dice foti stata sepolta e nessuno la resusciter il governo berlusconi aveva promesso di abolirla nella sua prima riunione e cos stato i comuni piuttosto mettano ordine nella mole di imposte e tributi locali sostituendo ai tanti pagamenti ununica imposta per i servizi purch il pagamento sia equo e i servizi siano reali per quanto riguarda lici prosegue lesponente di an la discussione chiusa anzi non si mai riaperta dopo la sepoltura da parte del governo berlusconi della vergognosa tassa che vollero amato e le sinistre
5047866 ripristinare lici le parole dellonorevole foti sono vangelo quella la linea e non c spazio per nessunaltra tesi in parlamento
5047867 le dichiarazioni del ministro delle riforme sulla reintroduzione dellici osserva leonardo domenici sindaco di centro sinistra di firenze e presidente dellassociazione nazionale del comuni italiani raccolgono la forte preoccupazione che viene dai comuni per una situazione come lattuale in cui essi non vedono garanzie e certezze circa il reintegro del mancato gettito dellici sulla prima casa e nella quale si torna palesemente ad un sistema di trasferimenti erariali e di limitazione della autonomia fiscale e finanziaria delle amministrazioni locali
5047868 in questo periodo si sta gia lavorando affinch si preveda la introduzione di un nuovo tributo per i comuni tale da garantire loro autonomia e responsabilit una ipotesi che abbiamo discusso con il ministro della semplificazione normativa roberto calderoli proprio quella di riunificare sotto la responsabilit dei comuni i tributi che riguardano gli immobili in modo da assicurare con quella che potremmo definire imposta federale sugli immobili le risorse necessarie alla erogazione dei servizi ai cittadini
5047869 la reintroduzione dellici dice in unintervista a skytg24 sar tema di discussione
5047870 federalismo fiscale vuol dire responsabilizzazione di tutti i livelli di governo a partire da quelli locali conclude brunetta per cui quello dellici sara un tema di discussione daltra se gli enti locali hanno la potest di governo sugli immobili sulla fisicit del territorio chiaro che questa sar per loro una fonte di tassazione

5047878 at the heart of this case is a little girl this defendant put her at risk placed her in fear and threw her family into turmoil that he is her father doesnt excuse his actions massachusetts law is very clear on this point
5047879 in light of these developments prosecutors will move to amend the complaint against this defendant to reflect his true name well also consider additional charges as warranted
5047880 its important to remember that children defenseless boys and girls at the mercy of the adults around them go missing with tragic frequency what we saw in this location effort was unusual in its publicity but not in our response every one of those cases is important to us and every one of those cases warrants the public assistance and the media coverage that proved so helpful in bringing this little girl home

5047884 i thought we were well in the game and when we got back on level terms i felt that we were in the ascendency and that we were going to go on from that
5047885 unfortunately we invited pressure on ourselves made poor decisions in key areas and were not able to recover all the hard work evaporated in those eight minutes and the game went away from us
5047886 i think people saw an improvement you have to sustain a performance from the first minute to the last we didnt so for an eight minute spell and it has cost us the game thats the level we play at you are up against good strikers and a lapse will cost you
5047887 i dont think the scoreline is a reflection on how we played it hurts at the moment but we will pick ourselves up for a big game next weekend unfortunately everybody is flying off for internationals but we will get the group back on thursday and work on the issues that came out of today
5047888 u s mint suspends gold coin sales futures price is a fiction
5047889 the u s mint buys direct from the refiners and this suspension of gold eagle sales may be an indication that the supply line is already backing up or that the mint expects that it will back up for the rest of the year i wonder who would give up physical metal at these prices and under these circumstances except distressed sellers the central banks are in a hunker down mode as far as i can determine and its the mines that supply the refiners so if the mint which buys from the refiners is having a difficult time locating metal what does that tell you i keep saying that we may get a surprising rubber band effect later in the year when the pre holiday festival season kicks off in september october it may happen sooner one of our indicators of approaching a bottom in gold is how many calls centennial precious metals gets from our u s based indian clientele heres a quote from my offices report to me at the end of the day today today was a good day there must have been an indian convention where someone was handing out usagold business cards that may give you a clue as to thinking in india proper and probably the rest of the asian rim

5047900 a free taste would go a long way in making the consumer case for mobile tv
5047901 mobile tv services have taken off in japan and south korea where service is offered free of charge in italy where additional fees have been the norm usage has been limited
5047902 once you start charging consumers they start getting turned off
5047903 if you look at folks of color even women theyre more successful in the democratic party than they are in the white uh excuse me in uh republican party
5047904 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5047905 we obviously are going to have to re evaluate the direction of the strategic relationship with russia going forward and again that depends to a considerable extent on their behavior from this point forward
5047906 russia currently is not in compliance with that cease fire
5047907 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5047908 clearly as far as im concerned has the upper hand right now
5047909 i think we had seen them more as partners and there had been a lot of signals from putin that he was going to allow power to flow to stay with the president that medvedev would be in charge would be the person responsible for leading russia going forward the steps hes taken in the transition from president to prime minister in recent weeks and now certainly in georgia at least in my opinion bespeak more of putin having his hand on the steering wheel than anybody else
5047910 if russia thought it was going to be able to bring down the georgia state bring down the democratic institutions it has failed
5047911 what theyve done instead is to bring down russias reputation as a potential and i want to emphasize potential partner in the international system
5047912 no one should try and force them back into a full relationship with georgia
5047913 if the russians intended this as intimidation they have done nothing but harden the attitudes of the small states around them
5047914 i think the russians have made a significant mistake here
5047915 it strikes me as pretty strident rhetoric and probably fairly empty rhetoric
5047916 the truth of the matter is russia is not going to launch nuclear missiles at anybody the poles know that we know it
5047917 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
5047918 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour

5047923 in a couple of these cases we agreed with her but the pattern of siding with government is troubling

5047927 esto es lo mejor que me ha pasado en la vida
5047928 generally has mild wet winters and hot dry summers winter temperatures can be severe in the mountains and even athens can get viciously cold
5047929 winter is pretty much a dead loss outside the major cities as most of the tourist infrastructure goes into hibernation from the middle of october till the beginning of april
5047930 and its a testament to the hard work and talent of the whole team looking to the future were keen to increase this lead further especially with the number of exciting games leading up to christmas and our now solid online presence thanks to x360s website and podcast

5047946 wallace collins has previously received 4 000 in donations from this secretive organization that took money from injured workers without their knowledge
5047947 collins has used this money for his own political purposes and should return that money at once
5047948 all candidates and those who had received funds from the working oklahomans alliance
5047949 well if were going to ask wallace collins to give back that money then we should ask all of them
5047950 because everyone who got that money should give it back
5047951 i doubt very seriously if any of these candidates or elected officials knew where that money came from
5047952 in campaigns you dont look gift horses in the mouth
5047953 i havent seen any proof that theyve done anything wrong or illegal
5047954 and i would certainly want to see proof of wrongdoing if thats what happened if mr warren can prove theyve done something illegal then id certainly like to know but just because he doesnt agree with them that doesnt mean theyve done anything illegal
5047955 they are registered with the state ethics commission so i dont know how that makes them secretive
5047956 was an attempt to divert attention away from the gops own problems
5047957 it seems strange ironic maybe that a group that has their own ethical problems such as disgraced former speaker lance cargill who is said to be under an ethics investigation for shaking down lobbyists would point the finger at someone else roger warren should worry about the beam in his own eye before he worries about the splinter in mine
5047958 and you should be able to enjoy the entire replay

5047979 just because youre on their side doesnt mean theyre on your side
5047980 iraq and afghanistan remain the central fronts in the struggle but we cannot lose sight of the implications of fighting a long term episodic multi front and multi dimensional conflict more complex and diverse than the cold war confrontation with communism
5047981 the first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool
5047982 i like the feeling when i stand on the springboard
5047983 i havent thought of retirement yet because i love diving
5047984 it didnt happen quite the way i would have liked it to but i have no regrets the journey is more important than the destination thats true whether you win a gold medal or you get eighth place
5047985 i dont want to think about that one dive to ruin my whole trip here
5047986 i love the olympics its just been awesome it makes you want to train that much harder to make it here in four years
5047987 ive been waiting four years for another gold it doesnt appear to the eye but ive had ups and downs but despite what i did in the past i made it today

5048028 the nypds latest plan to track and monitor the movements of millions of law abiding people is an assault on this countrys historical respect for the right to privacy and the freedom to be left alone that this is happening without public debate and that elected officials have had no opportunity to study this program is even more alarming

5048033 urging the creation of a london style surveillance system for the financial district that relies on license plate readers movable roadblocks and 3 000 public and private security cameras below canal street all linked to a coordination center at 55 broadway known as the lower manhattan security initiative the center is to open in september
5048034 could not say when the program operation sentinel would be completed
5048035 the lower manhattan initiative is expected to be in place by 2010
5048036 the bottom line is they cant frisk everybody coming into manhattan they cannot wand everyone as they do at airports this is a passive collection of data that is not as personally invasive as what they do at airports
5048037 it was targeted to a specific audience for specific reasons
5048038 we accomplished that mission and it will continue in another medium
5048039 were thrilled quite frankly it played out exactly how we hoped

5048053 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5048054 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5048055 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5048056 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5048057 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5048058 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5048059 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5048060 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5048061 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5048062 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5048063 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5048064 at uc berkeley ee100 is the introduction to electrical engineering class for non ee majors the goal of this course is to serve as a hands on electronics class we use multisim in the ee100 course because it is easy to use and abstracts the messy details of spice multisim also provides very useful features like the breadboard tool and instruments like the multimeter we can show students how to wire an ammeter without blowing fuses multisim also integrates with labview and this helps our students compare simulation data to experimental data

5048068 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5048069 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5048070 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5048071 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5048072 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5048073 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5048074 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5048075 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5048076 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5048077 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5048078 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5048079 this is a planning took where all things are going
5048080 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5048081 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5048082 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5048083 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5048084 the first half today was as good as we can play
5048085 we went into the match with a real determination to do well we didnt win anything last season and wanted to show what we are all about now
5048086 they played as a team they closed the midfield they played touch football one two
5048087 they took to the field what they had been doing in training for the last 20 days
5048088 lampard is not brazilian but he touched the ball very well michael ballack is not brazilian but he did the same i gave the players the freedom to play in their positions with their own style
5048089 i think they were surprised after five or 10 minutes by our team how aggressive we were
5048090 they are both fantastic they have options all the time
5048091 just too bright their movement was too much for us with cole with lampard with deco we found it difficult to run run with them to stay with them
5048092 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5048093 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5048094 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5048095 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5048096 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5048097 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5048098 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5048099 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5048100 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5048101 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5048102 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5048103 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5048104 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5048105 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5048106 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
5048107 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5048108 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5048109 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
5048110 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
5048111 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
5048112 remaja itu punya luapan yang luar biasa kalau ada cewek yang tidak mau diajak berhubungan seks oleh cowoknya diancam akan ditinggalkan
5048113 trademarks will not be automatically reserved but there will be an objection based mechanism for trademark owners where their arguments for protection will be considered
5048114 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5048115 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5048116 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5048117 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5048118 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5048119 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5048120 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5048121 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5048122 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5048123 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5048124 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5048125 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5048126 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5048127 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5048128 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5048129 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5048130 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5048131 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5048132 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5048133 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
5048134 you have value on the ground more than you spent
5048135 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
5048136 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
5048137 mccain frequently forgets key elements of policies gets countries names wrong forgets things hes said only hours or days before and is frequently just confused
5048138 lobbies regulatory agencies on alcohol issues that involve public health and safety
5048139 he doesnt listen carefully to people and make reasoned judgments
5048140 if john says im going with so and so you cant count on that the next morning
5048141 we continue to have concerns in particular for these eight children which is why we have asked the judge to review the case
5048142 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5048143 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5048144 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5048145 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5048146 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5048147 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5048148 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5048149 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5048150 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5048151 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5048152 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5048153 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5048154 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5048155 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5048156 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5048157 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5048158 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5048159 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5048160 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5048161 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5048162 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5048163 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5048164 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5048165 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5048166 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5048167 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5048168 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5048169 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5048170 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5048171 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5048172 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5048173 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5048174 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5048175 ich wollte hierher kommen und mein bestes geben ich war voller siegeswillen
5048176 hell do really well if this is something that he wants to do
5048177 three hours and 20 minutes worth ive never been in a chair that long from 5 p m et until the game ended i never moved
5048178 i knew some people that caught some foul balls and knew exactly where they were from i even gave some thats right joe like skip used to do
5048179 his thought process was great and he was very articulate i learned things about his current and past teammates that id never known before
5048180 its funny when im driving home from the game and i call my dad to tell him whats going on we end up talking about michael phelps for like 10 minutes
5048181 i think any athlete appreciates somebody like that somebody that dominant
5048182 i dont know if hes a fish or a super athlete but hes impressive
5048183 i wouldnt be surprised if his hands and his feet are webbed the way he could swim
5048184 you glue your eyes to the tv when hes getting ready to swim
5048185 hes going up against the best in a sport that used to be so equal for a long time to be this dominant is very impressive
5048186 i dont think youll see someone do that win eight gold medals in swimming in one olympics any time soon
5048187 you know hes got a longer track record than that
5048188 one of the things i think we have to unify the country around is having an intelligent energy policy thats what were going to be talking about
5048189 hey this guy has some decent strengths but hes not all up on his high horse either
5048190 the big thing is getting a feel for where carpenters at
5048191 he was pretty positive because everything kind of fell into place for him
5048192 he had real good command of his fastball and kept it down his cutter was real good his changeup was real good his breaking ball was good he mostly used it in counts where he was looking for chases and he got chases
5048193 i thought saturday was about as easy as ive seen him throw
5048194 about 95 to 98 mph with the power slider if he just goes out there and makes pitches the odds are always going to be in his favor
5048195 it might not come across as a lack of confidence but it may be more of a questioning of whats wrong why are they not as effective what you lose is the anticipation that youre going to be able to do what youre used to doing i dont think anyone can be ineffective over a long period of time and still expect to do well i think thats just human nature
5048196 tony is the kind of guy where his team really matters to him
5048197 its very important to him that he contributes and he takes it real hard when he doesnt do his job i think that lends itself to him overthrowing and doing more than he needs to do hes got back to really focusing on a good delivery and letting his stuff do what it will do when its located
5048198 ive felt it months ago we were playing well then too you feel it you get this sense of it because now guys fit into their roles
5048199 theres a different feeling this year guys are more patient at the plate weve had a better approach and obviously our pitching has gotten better
5048200 we say it every year that we have a team that can win but i think this time we do in big games and big series weve sucked it up and gotten it done
5048201 we have a tendency to slack off a little on games that we should roll and we get into that trap a little
5048202 but when its a big game and we need it guys are there
5048203 our bench has great depth pitching hitting everythings great we should have a litte bit of a swagger
5048204 start it as soon as possible start getting things right i cant tell you how many times ive had calls go against me
5048205 i thought they were going to take it to the arizona fall league and experiment with it there then i heard they were going to do it aug 15th and now im hearing theyre going to do it the last two weeks of the season
5048206 im not sure major league baseball is set on which direction they want to go with it
5048207 i think they should experiment it with the arizona fall league
5048208 theres probably going to be some issues with it im not so sure it should come in during the middle of the year or the end of the year or whether just to do it during the playoffs or world series is the right choice but thats not my choice thats bud selig and those people in the front office theyre going to do what they want to do it doesnt matter what i think
5048209 if they want it in there they have to start it somewhere
5048210 what if it doesnt work you can look at it both ways its tough
5048211 theres no way a replay can go that long because it affects the rhythm every player is going to be in
5048212 theyre human they cant be everywhere at every point in time
5048213 the game is going by really fast youre going to miss stuff the thing is you have a television camera that doesnt miss anything you can see it plain as day if you have to take five minutes stop the game lets get it right
5048214 but this year stands out a little bit more maybe its because were in a race but im playing good defense this year
5048215 i made a lot of mistakes when i was young i made a lot of errors that didnt need to be made ive got the ability to play good defense i didnt take advantage early in my career now ive put it all together
5048216 i used to make a lot of throwing errors i made stupid errors sometimes you have a chance to get the guy out and you throw the ball away youve got to know whos running and all that kind of stuff when you get older you realize all those things you know when to throw when not to throw
5048217 ill let alfonso soriano do that i cant do that
5048218 you know hes got a longer track record than that
5048219 one of the things i think we have to unify the country around is having an intelligent energy policy thats what were going to be talking about
5048220 the goal was to start sectarian violence with the car bombs
5048221 there used to be a whole brigade here and now its less soon these policies will backfire in tal afar and allow terrorists to come in
5048222 we used to depend mostly on coalition forces but unfortunately the footprint of the u s has been reduced
5048223 frankly we dont trust the iraqi police one hundred percent
5048224 when the aug 8 bomb went off in tal afar the police joined with the civilians to attack sunnis when we didnt join the fight they called us terrorists
5048225 as the iraqi units stood up over the past 18 months they took over our bases
5048226 we confirmed that they could operate in company and battalion strength
5048227 security forces want to focus on the true fight right now but they are forced into a two front war to stop reprisals in the population
5048228 running a plant day to day no matter what is challenging but we are ambitious and determined to restore it
5048229 it would be great to have the plant but have it run by a different company or a different family
5048230 theres a lot of ups and downs when you are recruiting so quickly
5048231 its a process thats evolving every day were constantly building
5048232 coming in within six weeks with enough people to get the plant to full capacity isnt a challenge its nearly impossible
5048233 i raised a fuss and i think im going to start next week
5048234 but some of those guys just got sent on a bus right back home
5048235 you see it and you are reminded of your commitment to do good
5048236 it is a struggle something we must deal with but with enough money and the right time and if we stay the course theres no reason we cant get there
5048237 if someone believes that life begins at conception im not going to change their minds
5048238 although the womens steeplechase has been on the program for several years now it hasnt yet been fully embraced as a real competition and never gets tested in the big international invitationals
5048239 so were still waiting to see just how fast the women can go the olympics should provide the major test that finally sees the 9 minute barrier broken
5048240 it doesnt matter little robin all i care about is you
5048241 let em look em up i aint writing down to nobody
5048242 when you sit behind my desk everything comes across it the list of my mistakes is just as long i turned down whiter shade of pale because it sounded too much like percy sledge
5048243 first i want you to dig this record i just made i just signed aretha franklin
5048244 i say this to the black apologists when we made those records with aretha the only black ass in the room was hers
5048245 man you dont produce ray charles you just get out of his way and let him do his thing
5048246 at atlantic we try to make careers to give our artists longevity
5048247 there are three kinds of producers the chess style where you cut them the way you hear them in the club theres the auteur producer phil spector mitch miller motown where the singer is just another element does it really matter whether its the crystals or the ronettes singing doris day or rosie clooney our method is to find the essence of the artist and enhance it they are the picture we make the frame
5048248 its a good way to attract families so that they can learn about you know small steps they can take to reduce their carbon footprint
5048249 weve tried to replace light bulbs we can probably encourage more recyclable materials with our vendors
5048250 because were a fair we like things bright and shiny lights running and colorful
5048251 a lot of them used to just leave them running all night because it looks nice
5048252 the rides that come in when youre talking about the types and sizes of exhibit buildings that we have it is a massive undertaking
5048253 we still had to use regular electricity to work the fans the misters to keep all the animals cool
5048254 its hard to go completely green but thats not to say that little things cant be done here or there
5048255 we found that to work better because the public doesnt necessarily know the different bins
5048256 the most important element is if theyre really taking it seriously or if theyre just paying lip service
5048257 thats our goal though is to change with the times
5048258 commencez par changer en vous ce que vous voulez changer autour de vous
5048259 lhomme na pas de nature lhomme sadapte a une nature lhomme change selon son environnement comme le disait paul valery lhomme na t pr matur cest sont entourage qui le transforme la nature humaine est simplement ce que la ssoci t a voulu quelle soit aujourdhui demain elle peut dd cider une autre nature
5048260 it was targeted to a specific audience for specific reasons
5048261 we accomplished that mission and it will continue in another medium
5048262 were thrilled quite frankly it played out exactly how we hoped
5048263 you never can predict how somethings going to do but we felt that the movie is so strong we just needed to get it out there
5048264 and he is one smart macho dude his sharp negotiating skills certainly outclass me must be all the spiritual meditation he did up in those mountains alone
5048265 i should never have started this mess by bombing those innocent russians in south ossetia
5048266 mr big showed me the error of my ways with those big brown eyes of his he also got the binding cease fire agreement signed
5048267 the united states stands with the government of georgia and that wookie and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia and its breakaway states be respected
5048268 russians invaded georgia my god where will we get our peaches from now
5048269 cannot delete tmp164 5 tmp there is not enough free disk space
5048270 the program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down if the problem persists contact the program vendor
5048271 wait for the program to start or else press ctrl alt del to restart the computer
5048272 ce qui se passe dans les centres de r tention
5048273 nous souhaitons d noncer ce qui se passe dans les centres de r tention que ce soit au mesnil amelot seine et marne ou partout ailleurs en france ou en europe
5048274 nous demandons galement que tous les travailleurs sans papiers soient r gularis s
5048275 r gularisation de tous les sans papiers ni rafles ni d portation ni exploitation non au projet de loi hortefeux non la politique des quotas
5048276 ne uccide pi la penna che la spada paura eh
5048277 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
5048278 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
5048279 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
5048280 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
5048281 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
5048282 but this time the explosion came so abruptly i dont remember what happened afterward
5048283 our neighbor thinks it can fight us we are telling it no
5048284 we do not want to believe that the united states has given a green light to this adventurous act
5048285 but our american colleagues are telling us that theyre investigating now what may have happened in the channels of communication for mr saakashvili to have behaved in such a reckless manner
5048286 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
5048287 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
5048288 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
5048289 they can use their overwhelming regional military power to beat up on a small neighbor
5048290 i dont think thats actually a very good place from which to proceed on an argument that russia ought to be considered a responsible member of the international system
5048291 so from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
5048292 the most important thing in life is to learn how to give out love and to let love come in love is the only rational act
5048293 i wanted to do something no one else had done in sport this goes hand in hand with my goal of changing the sport of swimming
5048294 so many people said it couldnt be done but all it takes is an imagination that is something i have learned
5048295 it has been from getting my hand on the wall and winning by one one hundredth to doing my best times in every event
5048296 it has been nothing but an upward rollercoaster and it has also been nothing but fun
5048297 ich machs wie der liebe gott der l sst sich auch nicht so oft blicken hat aber trotzdem ein gutes image
5048298 so when you give to the needy do not announce it with trumpets as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets to be honored by men i tell you the truth they have received their reward in full
5048299 ni h ros ni bourreau un peu de douleur un peu de plaisir je ne lui aurai donn que cela que cela
5048300 you were a loud and sometimes obnoxious little kid joe
5048301 but you were a good boy and you didnt like people around you to be quiet or sad even if you were
5048302 ibu hamil yang sudah tidak bisa tidur dengan baik di awal kehamilannya boleh jadi akan merasa sangat sedikit tidur di kehamilan lanjut
5048303 i could never escape the impression that the whole region was in mourning for the first world war
5048304 he studied literature in college but he shifted his focus to anthro pology and archaeology which influenced his poetry he often put himself into a trance before he writing and he tried to take the point of view of animals
5048305 la dualisation de notre soci t entre les populations les plus riches et les plus pauvres est de plus en plus violente pour maintenir une soci t de march o ceux qui nont rien perdre se tiendront tranquilles face la richesse des autres aux biens de consommation outrance la publicit omnipr sente il faut une sorte d tat policier bas sur la surveillance le contr le et la peur de la prison
5048306 look out the window and see who or what is here
5048307 here lies arthur c clarke he never grew up and did not stop growing
5048308 a necessary evil in the childhood of our particular species
5048309 now unfortunately he didnt live long enough to see any of these last wishes come true and i think the challenge for all his fans and all his admirers is to make these three wishes come true as early and as comprehensively as possible
5048310 its better to be recognized for one thing especially something of which im quite proud than not to be recognized at all
5048311 nobody has done more in the way of enlightened prediction
5048312 i want to be remembered most as a writer i want to entertain readers and hopefully stretch their imaginations as well

5048347 running a plant day to day no matter what is challenging but we are ambitious and determined to restore it
5048348 it would be great to have the plant but have it run by a different company or a different family
5048349 theres a lot of ups and downs when you are recruiting so quickly
5048350 its a process thats evolving every day were constantly building
5048351 coming in within six weeks with enough people to get the plant to full capacity isnt a challenge its nearly impossible
5048352 i raised a fuss and i think im going to start next week
5048353 but some of those guys just got sent on a bus right back home
5048354 you see it and you are reminded of your commitment to do good
5048355 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5048356 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5048357 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5048358 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5048359 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5048360 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5048361 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5048362 i only disagree with the common interpretation when the common interpretation is wrong
5048363 i was sent only to the lost sheep of israel
5048364 get rid of this filth jesus she doesnt deserve a thing from you
5048365 its not fair to take the childrens bread and throw it to the dogs
5048366 what has he just done omigosh he just like totally gave the grace of god to someone who didnt even deserve it the shock
5048367 i was sent only to the lost sheep of israel
5048368 we knew what they were going to do it was all a political ploy
5048369 the charter will now be used to promote the agenda of the flp that is to be expected
5048370 he wants a bite of both sides of the cake
5048371 irrespective of mr chaudhry not completing his team with the interim regime
5048372 he chaudhry had been aiding abetting and running something illegal and contrary to ourconstitution of fiji
5048373 he knows his political time is over he used the national council for building a better fiji to promote labours agenda and hes going to use this as a political campaign
5048374 hit a dead tennis ball against a wall with an old wooden racquet
5048375 there was no directive or anything at all in that regard if they have any evidence they must produce it
5048376 as far as we are concerned this is a collective decision of the party
5048377 i had hinted to the pm once the charter is ready we will step down
5048378 for us the party comes first for the past 18 months we have been busy with our duties to the interim government
5048379 i tried to call him on his phone but couldnt so i left him a message there
5048380 it is to allow it to effectively engage with the population with respect to the draft charter as well as to prepare for the next general elections
5048381 the national council has therefore directed that the three flp ministers holding cabinet portfolios resign from the interim government and advise the interim prime minister accordingly
5048382 listen mate the big fella upstairs has looked down kindly in that regard
5048383 the big fella up stairs has got to be on our side at some stage
5048384 at some stage soon weve got to get some reward for our effort thats the thing that really frustrates me i feel bad for them too i feel bad because weve lost but i feel bad for them because they work their bums of every week and just walk off not quite getting on top
5048385 there has been probably only one game where we werent in a winnable position and that was against colac at colac
5048386 you get 18 games to qualify to get in and at the moment we are right on the edge
5048387 no visibility around us planes circled around us but could not see it weather was horrific and had to survive another night

5048389 this is an issue that is not on the table
5048390 everyone knows that we disagreed with his decision in terms of the
5048391 when al qaeda was in afghanistan they had the partnership of a government they had ready access to international communications ready access to travel
5048392 its much more difficult for them to move around much more difficult for them to communicate

5048395 children and dogs are as necessary to the welfare of the country as wall street and the railroads

5048397 senator kennedy killed that girl the same as if he put a gun to her head and pulled the trigger
5048398 the klan is needed today as never before and i am anxious to see its rebirth here in west virginia
5048399 with a negro by my side rather i should die a thousand times and see old glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels a throwback to the blackest specimen from the wilds
5048400 how did it come about that highly sensitive technical information was given to the chinese why did the president ignore the national security experts who counseled against this deal what damage has been done to our national security
5048401 lone ranger work has taken him dangerously close to the neighborhood of what we used to call treason
5048402 indeed some of israels best friends and most articulate defenders can be found in the blogosphere little green footballs atlas shrugs hugh hewitt and debbie schlussel all provide a refreshing alternative to the moral relativism and politically correct anti israel blather of the media
5048403 we are perishing for want of wonder not for want of wonders
5048404 if you can become aware of the miraculousness which i symbolise you can help save the freedom mankind is unhappily losing
5048405 oh thats right thats ok i can go when my leg is better

5048412 the first thing id like to do to my mum is just hug her said phelps whose parents separated when he was young
5048413 ive literally seen her for about 30 seconds this whole time
5048414 its been nothing but an upwards rollercoaster but its been nothing but fun
5048415 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination
5048416 the economy and gas prices are always on your mind but michaels success helps you forget depressing things
5048417 if you want to commit suicide it is up to you but you do not have the right to kill your country
5048418 i am a pipe welder who knew nothing about chemistry but i have learned a lot from this website its set up for someone who has never had a chemistry class me if i can understand this anyone can
5048419 for anyone starting out or still in the r amp d phase of scaling up and tweaking the process to improve quality disregard anything other than the tried and tested directions at jtf print them out read them and then re read them follow the instructions dont add or subtract anything and you will be making quality biodiesel
5048420 my best advice is to follow explicitly the instructions on the j2f website starting from the begining and you will do just fine in my own journey of discovery i learned this you cannot afford to cut corners dont be tempted to use less than accurate measures and think that it will be alright there is no cheating
5048421 we got hold of two gentlemen who are running seminars on making biodiesel neither of them is making quality biodiesel in fact they are teaching everyone else how to make poor quality biodiesel one didnt even know what the
5048422 your website is very well done i appreciate the layers of technical complexity you have progressively more technical information layered in an escalating and logical fashion i like the links as each new item is introduced the user can click for more specific information on a topic and it opens in a new window this eliminates the tediousness of having to constantly backtrack to where the new concept was introduced
5048423 i just want to say how important what you all are doing here is closed system fuel production on a local or small regional scale tied to local resources using accessible technologies and dependent on entrepreneurial innovation combined with open source information exchange its awesome keep up the good work everyone before the planet fries
5048424 understanding of the process is vital to operate the plant
5048425 methanol is a very active chemical against which the human body has no means of defence it is absorbed easily through the skin and there is no means of elimination from the body so levels of methanol dissolved in the blood accumulate
5048426 biodiesel is a chemically altered plant oil however the process to chemically change the structure of pure plant oil is a very costly operation and requires a lot of energy as it removes the glycerine substituting it by methanol as well as adding other chemicals making the end product poisonous and equally hazardous as fossil diesel fuel
5048427 methanol treatments of c3 plants most food crops have been found to result in growth improvement as a plant source of carbon methanol is a liquid concentrate 1 cc of methanol provides the equivalent fixed carbon substrate of over 2 000 000 cc of ambient air methanol treatments are a means of placing carbon directly into the foliage the application of 10 100 methanol to some crops increased photosynthetic productivity the uptake of methanol by plants in light leaves no significant residual methanol above baseline as detectable by chromotography within 15 30 minutes of penetration treatment with methanol is therefore an inexpensive safe and effective means of providing plants with a source of fixed carbon and carbon dioxide an economical means of inhibition of photorespiration has been sought for decades and methanol may well provide the solution the control of photorespiration across the food crops of the world could double yields

5048436 this is the greatest weekend in british olympic history we havent delivered at this level of consistency for many many generations
5048437 i want to send my congratulations to team gb on this golden weekend for british sport
5048438 eight gold medals and seventeen medals in total in one weekend is a superb and unprecedented achievement the whole country has been watching and has been thrilled by team gb
5048439 we are immensely proud of what they have achieved so far and inspired by their performance
5048440 the royal family are taking a keen interest the olympics and the princess royal is attending the games everyone is delighted at the british success over this weekend
5048441 i want this olympic period for britain to be the time when the place of sport in our society changed for ever
5048442 success at the very top does inspire people to get out there and take up sport so we have just got to keep this going now
5048443 britains got much more serious about sport in the last 10 years weve now got to take this momentum and take it to a new level
5048444 this could be our best olympic performance in the last 50 years and is the perfect springboard for london 2012
5048445 it might mean me having to wear an australian rugby league shirt at old trafford which could be dangerous but its all healthy fun
5048446 our goal remains gaining a fair contract and we are prepared to continue to bargain in good faith to reach the agreement our members deserve
5048447 were disappointed that union leadership forced us to this point
5048448 by failing to negotiate a new contract cwa leadership has denied its membership key union protections and benefits
5048449 mr chaudhry has not implemented any measures to help the cane farmers
5048450 some people have being fighting for democracy all this time and being members of trade union movements we feel that they should not have being part of an illegal regime
5048451 this is another move they made that would point to the important step they should take to hold elections
5048452 we need elections as soon as possible for obvious reasons
5048453 he did whatever his role demanded him to do and what he thought was the best for his ministry
5048454 we of course share a difference of opinion on the tax subject and we had a very professional and constructive argument with him on the matter
5048455 now that the flp has left the administration the next stage would be the formation of a government of national unity through a panel of political party representatives appointed by the president
5048456 this will open up for members of other political parties
5048457 what we need is an instrument that is unifying and the draft peoples charter points out that above all we need leaders with a progressive vision for fiji
5048458 a government of national unity is truly the next step
5048459 any uncertainty with regard to a firm date for elections will be to the great detriment of this nation
5048460 to address such stated contentions the flp will have to be objective in its approach to the charter and be guided by its representatives and electoral constituents
5048461 to this end the flp will begin its charter consultation process immediately
5048462 as far as him joining the election we would like hear from mr bainimarama about mr chaudhrys decision
5048463 why did he support the coup and why did he take millions of dollars that rightfully belonged to the people
5048464 if the church leaders would like to objectively and constructively go through the charter then we would be happy to do that
5048465 we are providing copies of the charter to them first thing on monday today we myself or another member could go before the conference and make a presentation
5048466 it would be good if someone could enlighten them on the charter process
5048467 the blood drive will be from 10am to 6 30pm from monday to friday
5048468 there is still a need for blood at the colonial war memorial hospital and this is the third time we are organising such a blood drive at the festival
5048469 i would like to encourage the public who come there to enjoy the hibiscus to take some time out and think of members of the community admitted at the cwm and assist them by donating a pint of blood
5048470 we all know that one of the purposes of the hibiscus is to assist disadvantaged communities
5048471 to the thousands who would be flocking to enjoy what the festival has to offer it would also be an opportunity for them to donate a pint of blood which could save a life
5048472 we are looking forward to a successful week of blood collection to ensure that our community hospitals are adequately stocked with blood supply for use in various medical procedures
5048473 i want to urge the fiji law society to treat young lawyers with the utmost courtesy and respect as the young lawyers treat the law society and the senior practitioners in a very respectful manner
5048474 the people tasked with doing the statistics have not been doing their jobs well
5048475 the government statistics are right because they asked the people their religion and they confirmed that they are methodists
5048476 the election of the church president will be held when the conference opens on august 25
5048477 we need to address the census issues so we have to look at those figures
5048478 the church 213 000 methodists in our records but the latest government census says there are 300 000
5048479 this means that more than 80 000 methodists are not on record and the church is trying to find out where they live and why they did not their names
5048480 that we fast and pray for our nation to bring about good governance
5048481 but we will never attract them to parliament if the governance of our country appears a big circus or nightmare to them
5048482 after the past 20 years we have some major work to do to change such perceptions and attract quality people
5048483 it will take another 20 years of sophistication to diminish this factor significantly
5048484 so we must discuss it and look at ways of throwing up to parliament our best leaders
5048485 it was a private affair and restricted only to the yavusavasu clan and immediate family members and those from his mothers village of vuna in taveuni
5048486 there was no notice or anything and the water truck was not on time trucks supplied water right in the evening on saturday
5048487 the system is designed so that when voters dont get satisfactory service their member of parliament steps in to speak on their behalf
5048488 under normal circumstances i should be able to ask questions about lack of water supply to my constituency and i should be able to approach the pwd and ask them how they can provide us with normal supply
5048489 there were no reports of criminal activities and we hope this will continue throughout the week
5048490 logic is a professional tool i get professional results with it every day
5048491 were it to be ten degrees hotter i would declare it unreasonable to hitchhike across america but being that the temperature is what it is i must perservere
5048492 or how bout a nice place to sleep or eat
5048493 i appreciate you stopping i think it mustve been a miracle that you showed up because id just discovered id ran out of water
5048494 nobody here can live forever quiet in the grasp of dusk and summer
5048495 bad luck for the young poet would be a rich father an early marriage an early success or the ability to do anything well
5048496 una serie que est pasando sin mucha gloria pero de la que sin duda hay que destacar los alg n ejemplo

5048498 das salzkammergut erf llt die sehnsucht nach lebenskraft und lebensfreude
5048499 dass es eine koordinierte abstimmung und ein funktionierendes gesamtkonzept gibt ist nat rlich auch f r investoren interessant
5048500 das ist genau die kategorie f r die wir dringenden bedarf haben
5048501 i think youre getting a bargain its worth more than youve paid
5048502 cest un peu vid mais moi jaime bien un trombone qui est un peu vid
5048503 if you guys are going to run stuff and run every lie under the sun have somebody stand up for somebody
5048504 have me as a man who ended a relationship stand here and write some truth have me stand up for somebody and write that jennifer aniston is the smartest most sophisticated person i think ive ever met
5048505 shes one of the most lovely people ive ever met in my life and im going through something thats a very personal thing and you have to give that up
5048506 you have to give everything up because you cant have it all and it sucks
5048507 but its about time that somebody stands up for that girl and i think shes great
5048508 people are different they have different chemistry they have different lives
5048509 its not about years its about going out with somebody being truthful on the way in being truthful in the middle and being truthful on the way out
5048510 i think he came to spring training with a different look and he really wanted to establish himself this year as a good major league player and hes certainly done that
5048511 its a day to day proposition for him he doesnt take anything for granted hes had that look in his eye since the first day of spring training
5048512 im just pressing a little bit i feel like ive been hitting some balls hard but i think its more of a mental thing
5048513 melvin is a good judge when it comes to that stuff
5048514 so i trust his opinion and trust his judgment on this
5048515 this is where there will be one centralised negotiation process that will bargain on behalf of the countries in the initiative
5048516 as far as we are concerned commodore bainimarama has registered and is due to attend the meeting and we have heard nothing to the contrary
5048517 i am sure there is intention for bilateral talks but that is very much a business of the two countries
5048518 from saturday when the market closes the council workers do shift work to clean up
5048519 they use water blaster to try to get it ready for monday there is a project worth about 13 14million that we are planning
5048520 we had awarded the contract to erasito consultants but the 2006 coup took place and we had to shelve the project until now
5048521 we had even appointed the architect to draw up the plans
5048522 we had tried twice through the interim government to get the project going but they asked us to provide them with a feasibility study and public participation so we did it there was wide public consultation and the upgrading work was scheduled to start this year
5048523 it would have taken two to three years to complete
5048524 we were going to do it in two phases because the market was going to be a multi storey building
5048525 all the things that we thought might get customers there to shop were to be included in the building
5048526 we were also thinking of a plan to relocate the commercial wharf to rokobili terminal at korovou
5048527 we were doing the terminal and bus terminal according to that plan so that they could free up the kings wharf for tourism
5048528 i will be waiting for you to change this should be a place for change this is not a collusive place but one where you should rehabilitate yourself
5048529 i think this should have been done a lot time ago and i commend those taking the initiative to do it
5048530 but abiding by the lessons after release is a hard thing to do because the community looked down at fellows like us
5048531 i wanted to be a soldier but ended up wearing the wrong uniform
5048532 if you buckle to peer pressure or want to lead a macho life you could end up in prison
5048533 the disciplinary problems experienced in schools around the country nowadays clearly indicate that students are the most vulnerable group
5048534 you are the most likely candidates for the prison system if you do not think of the implications
5048535 i would like to remind you that prison life is no glamour

5048619 in commenting on the war in the caucasus most american analysts have tended to see it as a throwback to the past as a continuation of a centuries old blood feud between russians and georgians or at best as part of the unfinished business of the cold war but the conflict is more about the future than the past it stems from an intense geopolitical contest over the flow of caspian sea energy to markets in the west when the republics of the caspian sea basin became independent of russia and began seeking western customers for their oil and natural gas western companies eagerly sought production deals but because the caspian is landlocked oil has to travel by pipeline and at the time russia controlled all pipeline capacity not wanting to rely exclusively on russia president clinton sponsored the construction of an alternative pipeline known as the btc from baku in azerbaijan to tbilisi in georgia and then onward to ceyhan on turkeys mediterranean coast the btc passes through chechnya and georgias two breakaway provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia with this in mind the clinton and bush administrations made georgia the leading recipient of u s arms and equipment in the former soviet space president bush has also lobbied u s allies in europe to fast track georgias membership in nato all of which was viewed in moscow with immense resentment not only was the u s helping to create a new security risk on russias southern borders but more importantly was frustrating its drive to secure control over the transportation of caspian energy to europe it is against this backdrop that the fighting in georgia and south ossetia has been taking place
5048620 its a scramble for the spoils of global warming as the rapid melting of arctic sea ice is opening access to previously unreachable deposits of oil and gas setting off a race by northern nations including the u s canada and russia to claim them the scramble will be made visible this week as the coast guard cutter healy sails north from barrow alaska on thursday to map the sea floor of the chukchi cap an area at the northern edge of the beaufort sea the maps could bolster u s claims to the area as part of its extended outer continental shelf the u s geological survey confirmed last month what the oil industry had long suspected that the area north of the arctic circle may hold as much as 90 billion barrels of oil and 1 669 trillion cubic feet of natural gas or roughly 13 of the worlds total undiscovered oil and 30 of the undiscovered natural gas the dash to stake out territory across the arctic has accelerated since russia sent one of its submarines last august to plant the countrys flag on the sea floor beneath the north pole provoking an outcry by other nations that viewed it as an unauthorized land grab

5048624 mountaintop removal could be ended by as early as next year said matt wasson of appalachian voices now there is an increasingly powerful and vocal national movement to stop it what makes mountaintop removal cost effective is a valley fill permit which allows the overburden dirt and rock removed to expose the coal to be dumped into adjacent valleys wasson pins his hopes on two distinct possibilities a pending u s 4th circuit court of appeals ruling on a west virginia court case and the election of a new u s president the west virginia lawsuit seeks to put a stop to valley fill permits which are issued by the army corps of engineers central is the question of whether the discard from mining should be considered waste under the 1977 clean water act which limits the release of pollutants into streams i dont know what will happen said joe lovett of the i can tell you we havent had any significant permits issued since march 2007 because the court found that the federal government was illegally issuing permits at that time lovett added that if the appeals court upholds the decision the federal government which he said loosened its regulations during the current administration would have to completely change its permitting processes how can they approve the filling of hundreds and a couple thousand miles of mountain streams in this region and say thats not significantly degrading the water activists say that while opposition to mountaintop removal is reaching critical mass it will ultimately take action by a new administration in washington to clarify clean water act regulations to define mine spoil as waste or prohibit mountaintop removal outright
5048625 a year after world bank president robert zoellick pledged to significantly step up our assistance in fighting climate change the development institution is increasing its financing of fossil fuel projects around the globe for example once the 4 14 billion coal powered ultra mega plant in western india which the world bank helped to finance with 450 million in loans and guarantees and now possibly a 50 million ownership stake is fully operational it will emit more co2 annually than the nation of tunisia the world banks lending record does not match up to zoellicks rhetoric says heike mainhardt gibbs a consultant to the bank information center a washington watchdog group the institution is simply not slowing down its significant funding of fossil fuel projects the reason such plants offer the speediest economic payoffs helping fulfill the banks mandate to battle deprivation and refill its coffers so it can lend more increasing access to energy in impoverished countries just with renewable sources is not feasible says somit varma of the banks oil gas mining and chemicals department the recipient of the world bank groups coal power loan tata power is the biggest electricity generator in india thats not under state control with a stock market value of 5 5 billion and shares that have increased more than six fold over the past five years in the year ended march 31 the company reported net earnings of 206 million up 25 from the year before world bank critics say funding for tata ultra and other energy projects including 300 million for the privatization of a coal fired calaca power plant in the philippines and 50 million to salamander energy for oil and gas exploration in southeast asia sacrifice air and water quality for revenue

5048628 a global fertiliser crisis caused by high oil prices and the u s rush to biofuel crops is reducing the harvests of the worlds poorest farmers soaring food and commodity prices are not lifting millions of developing country farmers out of poverty or causing more food to be grown because small farmers either consume their own crop or have no access to global markets to take advantage of the higher food prices a world fertiliser forecast report states that prices will remain high for at least three years and possibly longer fertiliser prices have mostly doubled and in some cases risen by 500 in 15 months as u s farmers have rushed to plant more biofuel crops and countries such as india and china have bought fertiliser stocks in large quantities to guarantee their food stocks but while the unprecedented price explosion has barely affected large commercial farmers it is leading directly to civil unrest among small farmers in developing countries who desperately need fertilisers to replenish nutrient depleted soils there have been fertiliser riots or demonstrations in vietnam india kenya nepal nigeria egypt pakistan and taiwan in the last few months last week one man was killed in a stampede at a government handout of fertiliser in hyderabad india

5048630 prince charles was branded a luddite on wednesday as his claims that a global shift towards planting more genetically modified crops would destroy the earths environment met a withering response the prince who started his own organic food brand duchy originals 18 years ago in an interview accused companies of conducting a gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong gm is increasingly being put forward as a potential solution to the spiralling cost of food while environmentalists rushed to the princes defence there was a backlash from politicians academics and industry figures phil willis chairman of the commons science committee said the use of science in farming had helped feed billions of people levelling the luddite charge des turner a labour mp added prince charles has got a way of getting things absolutely wrong syngenta which develops gm crops said if were going to feed the world we have to use every technology at our disposal the company said organic farming was harsher on the environment than gm technology if you were to go organic you would have to double and triple the amount of land under cultivation only by using technology will you protect wild spaces and biodiversity the prince won backing from mike childs of friends of the earth uk who said he had hit the nail on the head about the false solution presented by gm crops
5048631 power plant emissions may actually be made worse by capturing the co2 and pumping it deep underground a new study reported online and in an upcoming international journal of greenhouse gas control suggests even with the extra energy it takes to bury co2 a carbon sequestering plant emits between 71 and 78 less co2 than a normal coal fired plant for each unit of usable electricity produced but when the researchers factored in all the cradle to grave pollution of a co2 burying plant emissions of acid rain causing gases like nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides were up to 40 greater than the total cradle to grave emissions of a modern plant that doesnt capture its co2 of course if the mining transportation and other supporting technologies become greener in the future the pollution penalty for carbon sequestration would be reduced the researchers note the decision to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions is going to be intertwined with decisions about how to deal with these other emissions comments jim dooley an expert in carbon sequestration at the joint global change research institute in college park md and one of the lead authors for a major 2005 report on carbon sequestration by the ipcc that ipcc study concluded that nearly all properly buried co2 would probably remain underground for centuries
5048632 last year a private company proposed fertilizing parts of the ocean with iron in hopes of encouraging carbon absorbing blooms of plankton meanwhile researchers elsewhere are talking about injecting chemicals into the atmosphere launching sun reflecting mirrors into stationary orbit above the earth or taking other steps to reset the thermostat of a warming planet this technology might be useful even life saving but it would inevitably produce environmental effects impossible to predict and impossible to undo similar questions are being raised about nanotechnology and robotics there are even those who suggest humanity should collectively decide to turn away from some new technologies engineers scientists philosophers ethicists and lawyers are taking up the issue in scholarly journals online discussions and conferences but so far most conversation has been piecemeal when the california based concern called planktos announced its iron fertilization plan in the south atlantic in hopes of producing carbon absorbing plankton blooms that the company could market as carbon offsets countries bound by the london convention issued a statement of concern about the work and a u n group called for a moratorium but it is not clear what would have happened had planktos not abandoned the effort for lack of money when scientists and engineers discuss geoengineering it is obvious they are talking about technologies with the potential to change the planet but the issue of engineering ethics applies as well to technologies whose planet altering potential may not emerge until it is too late

5048638 the major drivers of tropical deforestation have changed in recent decades according to a recent article deforestation has shifted from poverty driven subsistence farming to major corporations razing forests for large scale projects in mining logging oil and gas development and agriculture while this change makes many scientists and conservationists uneasy authors rhett a butler of mongabay com and william f laurance of the smithsonian tropical research institute in panama believe that the shift gives environmentalists and concerned governments a clear identifiable target that may prove more responsive to environmental concerns it is easier for pressure groups to target corporations and enterprises rather than tens of millions of poor farmers who are simply trying to put food on the table for their families says butler were already seeing the global soy palm oil and timber industries beginning to change their approach theyre realizing they cant run roughshod over the environment its just too risky in addition some massive financial firms including goldman sachs jp morgan chase citigroup and bank of america have altered their lending practices after coming under fire from environmentalists butler added

5048640 the bush administration on monday said it plans to let federal agencies decide for themselves whether highways dams mines and other construction projects might harm endangered animals and plants the proposal which does not require the approval of congress would reduce the mandatory independent reviews that government scientists have been performing for 35 years developers welcomed the plan while environmentalists derided it interior secretary dirk kempthorne said late monday the changes were needed to ensure that the endangered species act would not be used as a back door to regulate the gases blamed for global warming in may the polar bear became the first species declared as threatened because of climate change these changes are designed to reduce the number of unnecessary consultations under the esa so that more time and resources can be devoted to the protection of the most vulnerable species the interior department said in its announcement
5048641 so remember that proposed rule change for the endangered species act the one that would effectively gut it a few interesting details normally the fish and wildlife service has a 90 day comment period for a rule change like this when the draft of this rule change was first released it was cut to 60 now its down to 30 in this case it was determined that we need to move forward in a timely fashion said interior department spokeswoman tina kreisher mm hm also theyre not having any public hearings on this and if thats not enough the fws instituted a little change in its own rules back in dec 07 it seems theyll no longer accept comments over email for real clearly the bush administration is keen to hear what you have to say speaking of the esa debacle what do our valiant presidential candidates think about it obama this 11th hour ruling from the bush administration is highly problematic after over 30 years of successfully protecting our nations most endangered wildlife like the bald eagle we should be looking for ways to improve it not weaken it said obama campaign spokesman nick shapiro as president senator obama will fight to maintain the strong protections of the endangered species act and undo this proposal from president bush mccain a spokesman for sen john mccain of arizona the republican presidential nominee said he had no comment on bushs revisions

5048643 in an online article this week in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences uc berkeley researchers said substantial die offs of amphibians and other plant and animal species add up to a new mass extinction facing the planet amphibians have been around for about 250 million years said study co author david wake professor of integrative biology at uc berkeley they made it through when the dinosaurs didnt the fact that theyre cutting out now should be a lesson for us new species arise and old species die off all the time but sometimes the extinction numbers far outweigh the emergence of new species and extreme cases of this are called mass extinction events there have been only five in our planets history until now scientists said the sixth which wake and others argue is happening currently is different from the past events my feeling is that behind all this lies the heavy hand of homo sapiens wake said in 2004 researchers found that nearly one third of amphibian species are threatened and many of the non threatened species are in decline
5048644 the latest global assessment of cetaceans shows that the marine mammals throughout the worlds oceans have experienced mixed fortunes the iucn red list of threatened species reveals that some large species like humpbacks and southern right whales have seen numbers increase both animals had recorded increased numbers across much of their range primarily because they had been protected from commercial whaling the red list also showed that nearly a quarter of the 86 species assessed were considered to be at risk of extinction nine of which were listed as endangered or critically endangered studies have shown that the distribution of many whales is changing as the oceans warm conservationists fear that the change in behaviour could result in the mammals being exposed to new diseases and inter species competition for food military sonar is also deemed as a particular threat for deep diving beaked whales and melon headed whales despite a growing awareness of the range of threats facing the marine mammals increased shipping and fishing were still claiming a growing number of victims
5048645 many coastal areas of the worlds oceans are being starved of oxygen at an alarming rate with vast stretches along the seafloor depleted of it to the point that they can barely sustain marine life researchers are reporting the main culprit scientists say is nitrogen rich nutrients from crop fertilizers that spill into coastal waters by way of rivers and streams a study to be published friday in the journal science says the number of these marine dead zones around the world has doubled about every 10 years since the 1960s about 400 coastal areas now have periodically or perpetually oxygen starved bottom waters many of them growing in size and intensity

5048695 roosevelt and others set aside the public land we cherish so much
5048696 now we have to protect our private land we have to give incentives to the timber industry to the ranchers to the farmers to keep their land from being developed
5048697 the program could go the way of soil bank a similar program that ended in the 1960s we have to find a way to keep conservation competitive and a part of the landscape
5048698 there needs to be an acknowledgment and some sort of funding probably through carbon credits to mitigate the effects on wildlife habitat
5048699 wed water the tomatoes we put a little water on each plant to make it look like we watered them good then wed walk up to midway creek
5048700 then wed walk up to rocky run and hay creek

5048710 im also an avid shotgunner and i just love to see kids outdoors instead of indoors playing video games and having the tv as entertainment

5048714 the u s fish and wildlife service announced its scaup harvest strategy and minnesota feels its not appropriate or necessary to implement that strategy
5048715 we would have preferred to maintain our two scaup harvest while we work on what the scaups problems are
5048716 minnesota has taken wood duck recovery to heart and we arent hearing a clamor from hunters to go to three birds daily
5048717 im convinced if we can get the word out people of this state will vote yes if they understand whats at risk
5048718 minnesotans are like north dakotans they love their prairies we love our forests and our lakes
5048719 it doesnt make any difference whether its warroad or winona
5048720 maybe its bluffland protection in winona and it may be how to manage water in warroad or work with sharp tailed grouse but the problems are similar

5048726 i dont think theres anything more community oriented than getting together and voting yes for minnesota
5048727 if we do this were going to make history not just for minnesota but theres going to be a history part of a trend line for the nation
5048728 good things are in peril and we need to ring the bell to take care of it
5048729 to put the world in order we must first put the nation in order to put the nation in order we must put the family in order to put the family in order we must cultivate our personal life and to cultivate our personal life we must first set our hearts right

5048816 from the point of view of the voorwerp the galaxy looks as bright as it would have done before the black hole turned off its this light echo that has been frozen in time for us to observe
5048817 its rather like examining the scene of a crime where although we cant see them we know the culprit must be lurking somewhere nearby in the shadows
5048818 at first we had no idea what it was it could have been in our solar system or at the edge of the universe
5048819 we think that in the recent past the galaxy ic 2497 hosted an enormously bright quasar
5048820 because of the vast scale of the galaxy and the voorwerp light from that past still lights up the nearby voorwerp even though the quasar shut down sometime in the past 100 000 years and the galaxys black hole itself has gone quiet
5048821 ic 2497 is so close that if the quasar was still shining today on a good night you could probably see it with a small telescope the nearest active quasar called 3c 273 is 1 7 billion light years further away
5048822 its amazing to think that this object has been sitting in the archives for decades and that amateur volunteers can help by spotting things like this online
5048823 it was a fantastic present to find out on my 25th birthday that we will get observational time on the hubble space telescope to follow up this discovery
5048824 when we got the news about hannys voorwerp we were intrigued to find out what it was and fortunately we were able to slew the telescopes round and get some great images and spectra to study it
5048825 it was only later that we heard the story about how it had been discovered its inspirational that hanny picked out this object from galaxy zoo in her spare time and nobody had ever seen anything like it before
5048826 i feel very nervous when it comes to flavoring food

5048834 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
5048835 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
5048836 the state is the only one in india to have its own constitution and the president of india cannot issue directions to the state government in exercise of the executive power of the union as he can in every other state kashmiri are indian citizens but indians are not necessarily kashmiri citizens we cannot vote for elections to their assembly or own any property in kashmir

5048861 the appraiser said the house was worth 114 500 so why would we sell it for 100 000
5048862 i called regularly to ask for updates but most of the time they never returned my calls finally i just gave up
5048863 the mere fact that a number of complaints have been filed against a person doesnt mean that all of the complaints reach the level of where there needs to be disciplinary action taken
5048864 we were taken advantage of and there was no one there to protect us

5048875 we all came in and worked hard its nothing but a plus for us heading into the season
5048876 running a plant day to day no matter what is challenging but we are ambitious and determined to restore it
5048877 it would be great to have the plant but have it run by a different company or a different family
5048878 theres a lot of ups and downs when you are recruiting so quickly
5048879 its a process thats evolving every day were constantly building
5048880 coming in within six weeks with enough people to get the plant to full capacity isnt a challenge its nearly impossible
5048881 i raised a fuss and i think im going to start next week
5048882 but some of those guys just got sent on a bus right back home

5048885 one of the things i think we have to unify the country around is having an intelligent energy policy thats what were going to be talking about
5048886 it was targeted to a specific audience for specific reasons
5048887 we accomplished that mission and it will continue in another medium
5048888 were thrilled quite frankly it played out exactly how we hoped
5048889 you never can predict how somethings going to do but we felt that the movie is so strong we just needed to get it out there

5048928 weve asked our allies to provide any of the escort requirements for our chinooks and or possibly the charters in theatre
5048929 so that capability that the griffon might fulfill should be addressed by nato
5048930 im appalled that the government is not moving ahead on its own attack helicopters that would ensure we can move independently as a nation and bring our chinooks into hotspots and difficult landing areas
5048931 to me its fundamental that if were going to have half the capability which is the chinook then we should get the other half of the capability which is an attack helicopter
5048932 youve seen the ramp ceremonies for one or two soldiers can you imagine what a ramp ceremony for 35 people would be like

5048934 the afghans did not go to canada to kill the canadians rather it is the canadians who came to afghanistan to kill and torture the afghan
5048935 therefore you have to convince your government to put an end to the occupation of afghanistan so that the afghans are not killed with your hands and so that you are not killed with the hands of the afghans
5048936 this letter is a disgusting attempt to justify the deliberate killings of innocent civilians there is no justification for these killings by the taliban
5048937 canada is in afghanistan at the request of the democratically elected government of that country
5048938 we will continue to protect the afghan people from these ruthless killers
5048939 the taliban demonstrates time and again its willingness to target civilians including afghan civilians as part of their efforts
5048940 afghanistan has to try to have good relations with you
5048941 but if your government continues a reversed policy the afghans will be obliged to kill your nationals in revenge for their brothers their sisters and their children
5048942 if we arrest their journalists or aid workers we will target them as we did in logar province they are not differentiating women and children with military targets and we will not differentiate theirs too

5048983 the mayor feels that the city can no longer afford to run a zoo
5048984 i agree its not a mission critical function for a city to run a zoo
5048985 well see whats out there where we could put them where they would fit in that will send a signal to the people that the zoo is in the process of renewing itself and worthy of their support
5048986 not all projects get funded every year but they get in a queue
5048987 so if the city came back in 2010 and said this is our top priority it is very likely that it would get funded
5048988 if that passes the zoo would get a dedicated amount perhaps more than 200 000 out of that every year

5048994 it appeared to me that the defense is a little ahead of the offense at this time
5048995 i enjoyed the workout i didnt think we were as sharp as we would like to be there were too many penalties this was an officiated scrimmage and there were a few too many miscues it is stuff that we can get fixed and i look forward to getting back on the field and getting those things corrected
5048996 charles scott rushed the ball well and both jarrett lee and andrew hatch quarterbacks played well
5048997 jarrett lee threw the ball extremely well in this go
5048998 jordan jefferson got a couple of snaps and rushed for 25 yards he had a couple of completions and played pretty well at the quarterback spot
5048999 i think we got a lot of work done there with the number or reps that we were able to get in we took every kicking situation kickoffs returns punts punt returns field goals and really tested it
5049000 it is imperative that we take days like today to evaluate every position the quarterbacks the running backs the offensive line special teams coverage units kickers punters
5049001 as a coach you take a day like today and try to take the information and make wise moves from this point forward its a very important scrimmage
5049002 the tougher decisions are those guys who are more equal after you watch a scrimmage like this you can say which guy is in front of what guy except for a position like quarterback where it is the body of work not necessarily the key scrimmage in the stadium that makes the difference
5049003 if we should deal out justice only in this world who would escape no it is better to be generous and in the end more profitable for it gains gratitude for us and love

5049030 i just know that the russian president said several days ago russian military operations would stop
5049031 now he has said that tomorrow midday russian forces will withdraw and withdraw to their pre aug 6 7 lines this time i hope he means it
5049032 georgia if it wants to become a member of nato will become one
5049033 this must happen not in several weeks but in the coming days
5049034 they said they have two options move toward tbilisi or withdraw
5049035 in our post race inspection our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop they were magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 percent wide open
5049036 if this alleged incident proves true it goes against everything we stand for as an organization
5049037 we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us we will also investigate internally how this incident took place and who was involved and make whatever decisions are necessary to ensure that this kind of situation never happens again

5049091 lenovos goal with this blogger program is to give athletes a starting point for discussions and sharing of ideas and experiences about the olympic games

5049100 to be named is to be known amp to know who you are meant to be to be known you must be loved if someone knows who he is really knows then there is no need to hate or envy satan is an un namer causing people to not know who they are causing hate
5049101 if i hate someone whenever i think of them am i naming them
5049102 how do i name someone thing i do not love or find lovely
5049103 only love makes a person know who they are you are full of love but you do not know how to stay within it when it isnt easy if you fail to name someone you yourself are open to being un named you must find something worthy of love amp begin there
5049104 loving makes us wholly ourselves as well as making others whole
5049105 once the parties eliminated the uncertainty and one might say the excitement of the extended roll call votes the conventions became much more strategic affairs
5049106 the television audiences were never very large but there was some news value in the uncertainty now tv networks are keen to get back to their prime time coverage as soon as possible
5049107 we havent heard very much this time about the republican platform
5049108 we dont know how controversial thats going to be on hot button issues like abortion religion and taxes

5049111 its a very large amount a ballpark estimate of what is required to get scotland off fossil fuels is either 10 nuclear reactors or 10 000 wind turbines
5049112 russia is not going to launch nuclear missiles at anybody
5049113 im not quite sure why this deputy chief of staff felt compelled to make those kinds of threats
5049114 we are not giving up in glenrothes but it is certainly realistic to view the seat as already lost to the snp
5049115 if we consider ourselves as effectively already in opposition we can begin to fight back and you never know we could even win
5049116 personally i think that means leaving it long but no decisions have been taken yet

5049120 he was a real selfless pioneer who would push the envelope in art and technology without great expectations of returns
5049121 he didnt need to make a lot of money he didnt need to be famous he really just wanted to do great work
5049122 theyre taking care of him and were very grateful for it
5049123 its because people get to know us better find out so much more information about us giving us more exposure readers feel like they have a connection to us personally

5049128 lenovos goal with this blogger program is to give athletes a starting point for discussions and sharing of ideas and experiences about the olympic games
5049129 it isnt really a program about making millions of impressions in the traditional marketing sense its about making thousands of connections between athletes and fans
5049130 he was a real selfless pioneer who would push the envelope in art and technology without great expectations of returns
5049131 he didnt need to make a lot of money he didnt need to be famous he really just wanted to do great work
5049132 theyre taking care of him and were very grateful for it
5049133 when i was a kid all of my generation looked up to rodney pattison and all that he achieved
5049134 it seems a little surreal to be in the position that im in now but its been a long road and ive really enjoyed all of my olympic sailing career whether it was the games or the experience along the way
5049135 hes so young still and he has yet to do more i would be surprised if he didnt surpass
5049136 in my lifetime he is the most special sailor weve seen he could certainly go on to beat paul elvstroms record
5049137 its more than just being in a class on his own hes on his own planet
5049138 he just has no weaknesses and his skills are just way in excess of any of the opposition he just makes it look so easy
5049139 he has a special talent he can see the wind better than most he feels the boat better than most and is especially fast downwind but hes a very aggressive sailor and he takes no prisoners
5049140 we got a glimpse of just how cut throat he is with one move on the start line he completely took out any danger from railey
5049141 he didnt have to win the race all he had to do was to stay with zac but he wanted to he enjoyed the wind and just wanted to stretch his legs
5049142 speaking to the other finn competitors before the games they werent even discussing the possibility of winning gold it was very much who was going to win silver and bronze
5049143 even the danish guy ranked number one said it would be a catastrophe if ben didnt win it zach got into a good position but i think in his heart of hearts he was waiting for the big man to come
5049144 he was so much better than the rest that its hard to see how theyre going to catch up he can do a short term campaign and still be so dominant that i think we will see him come back time and time again
5049145 if he went to a new class like the star he would have to put a bit more time in technically theres a lot more to learn
5049146 but if he was involved in the americas cup i can see him staying in the finn because he knows he can come back in weymouth and win again
5049147 they did so well theyre a very polished team and dont have any weaknesses
5049148 they were a class above everybody else and we saw time and time again that even though they didnt necessarily make the best start they had it in the tool box to do what they needed to do
5049149 ive known sarah ayton for a long time she came out to sydney with me to help in my campaign and theres a great sense of pride to see her doing it for herself
5049150 it would be easy to assume that nick faldo was purring with delight as he sat in the cbs commentary booth as the final major of the year came down to a clash between two of the players who will
5049151 padraig harringtons successful defence of the open capped a riveting and at times tempestuous championship at royal birkdale all the talk in the build up was about the absence of tiger woods through injury and if i am honest he was
5049152 well that was fun wasnt it today it was all about the wind as the worlds finest golfers were blown off course by a howling gale that wreaked havoc at royal birkdale no one was able to shoot a round under
5049153 in some parts the water had reached waist level and we wanted to ensure that nobody was stranded in their homes
5049154 ellen and portia came out and posed for pictures with ellens mom and their two dogs
5049155 ellen was helping portia with the train of her dress which looked like a cinderella tutu
5049156 its something that weve wanted to do and we want it to be legal and we are very very excited
5049157 my feelings for ellen overrode all of my fear about being out as a lesbian she told the
5049158 that had never happened to me in my life where i saw somebody and experienced all of those things you hear about in songs and read about in poetry my knees were weak
5049159 i never would have thought my life would have turned out this way
5049160 to have money or to have a gorgeous girlfriend i just feel so lucky with everything in my life right now
5049161 an isaf unit on a mission to deny an insurgent safe haven has accidentally killed four civilians and wounded three others who were located inside a compound
5049162 the patrol identified insurgents with weapons on the roof of the compound preparing to attack and in order to protect themselves launched three rockets all of which hit the target
5049163 unbeknown to the patrol the civilians were inside the compound at the time
5049164 isaf deeply regrets the tragedy of this incident when women and children were killed and injured as a result of an imminent insurgent attack from a position where they militants would have known women and children were present
5049165 we spotted a twin engine aircraft coming over the country park and as it came over we noticed it was fairly low and literally within a split second we saw another much smaller light aircraft come from the right
5049166 the twin engined aircraft struck the light aircraft and just totally destroyed it
5049167 they are throwing people out of their houses and they are not only doing that but they acknowledge that they are doing that and they are doing ethnic cleansing
5049168 the political future of south ossetia is by definition for the south ossetians to determine they live in a difficult context they have to take into account the facts of history the facts of geography the realities of todays world
5049169 david womble georgias national director for world vision said those involved in the aid effort are running out of spaces for them
5049170 it was targeted to a specific audience for specific reasons
5049171 we accomplished that mission and it will continue in another medium
5049172 were thrilled quite frankly it played out exactly how we hoped
5049173 you never can predict how somethings going to do but we felt that the movie is so strong we just needed to get it out there
5049174 athletes should know about the a tradition of the olympic games
5049175 first came the historic finish by jamaica s shelly ann fraser sherone simpson and kerron stewart fraser s blazing race of 10 78 seconds captured the first gold medal in the event by a jamaican woman simpson and stewart tied for second in 10 98
5049176 its got suicide bombers political kidnaps and intercontinental war its got filthy propaganda rampant paranoia and secret treaties and the axis of evil is a spinner in the middle of the board
5049177 we dont need anything particularly clever to form our representation as there is a fairly commonplace way to represent connectons between components using monads
5049178 if you are making 150 000 a year or less as a family then youre middle class
5049179 it doesnt matter really what my definition of rich is
5049180 the goal was to start sectarian violence with the car bombs
5049181 there used to be a whole brigade here and now its less soon these policies will backfire in tal afar and allow terrorists to come in
5049182 we used to depend mostly on coalition forces but unfortunately the footprint of the u s has been reduced
5049183 frankly we dont trust the iraqi police one hundred percent
5049184 when the aug 8 bomb went off in tal afar the police joined with the civilians to attack sunnis when we didnt join the fight they called us terrorists
5049185 as the iraqi units stood up over the past 18 months they took over our bases
5049186 we confirmed that they could operate in company and battalion strength
5049187 security forces want to focus on the true fight right now but they are forced into a two front war to stop reprisals in the population
5049188 tatap muka juga dimaksudkan untuk mendapatkan masukan serta mendengar permasalahan secara langsung dari para wni tki bermasalah untuk kemudian ditindaklanjuti dan dicarikan pemecahannya

5049192 geez dont you think he deserves a little payback this tart is ready to go
5049193 theres a combination of reality and voyeurism that captures the imagination
5049194 if katie was this entertaining when she was actually on the air i might even watch her little newscast
5049195 its nice to be on youtube when i know the cameras are rolling harry shearer im gonna get you
5049196 and hed be like man the pizza is good today
5049197 i just wanted to make sure i took every single moment in and every single swim in every single moment with my teammates so i would remember them
5049198 to swim in the same era as him has been awesome
5049199 weve been talking about mark spitz for 36 years now
5049200 i dont know if im going to be alive when they stop talking about this bloke you wonder if we are going to see someone as good as this again
5049201 being able to have something like that to shoot for it made those days when i was tired and i didnt want to be there
5049202 im just thankful for him having done what he did
5049203 the sport of swimming has come a long way so far and i think it can go even further
5049204 mike is opening a lot of doors with what hes doing
5049205 i just want to lay in my own bed for five minutes at least and just relax
5049206 one of the things im really looking forward to is getting back to baltimore
5049207 hes more naturally suited for longer distances itll be change for him but i think itll be a good one
5049208 when we train every day sometimes there are workouts you dont like dont want to do bob says youre putting money in the bank
5049209 i guess i put a lot of money in the bank over the last four years and we withdrew pretty much every penny in the bank after bob and i both grab a little break itll be time to start depositing
5049210 to minimize dust entering the camera through the lens mount
5049211 maintains a membership of only one hundred from the greater washington d c area and beyond
5049212 the whole thing every race one after the other from winning by one hundredth of a second to finishing it off with a world record its an amazing experience and something ill have forever
5049213 i literally wanted to do something that no ones ever done before in this sport
5049214 its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster its been nothing but fun
5049215 it was tough to lose the 50m freestyle by one hundredth of a second
5049216 i realized i shouldnt have filed my nails last night
5049217 i did this in sydney 2000 but i was 33 then
5049218 when i was in the warm up area and saw phelps he said to me youve got it easy you only have to swim two races
5049219 when i was on the blocks this time i didnt feel like everyone else was better than me i know now that is rubbish i can do this
5049220 what ive done is show them middle aged adults that you can do it
5049221 im absolutely thrilled if i can help thats a rewarding experience i have had a fabulous time being part of the u s olympic team its been awesome
5049222 this year was difficult because of the penalty i got but thank god for my talent ive been given
5049223 i got the african record in the finals you never know what can happen you could get last or first in the olympic games anything can happen it was a miracle and for once the miracle was for me
5049224 the 400 was my best ranking that i have prepared for all year i got fifth place expecting the best
5049225 i just feel very privileged that i have been here to witness michael phelps win eight gold medals
5049226 for me that was the highlight i couldnt care less about my swims i feel very privileged that i was in the same era as such a great swimmer
5049227 it was an awesome feat because she is the most decorated swimmer
5049228 when i went into this meet i was so nervous going into this olympics with six events
5049229 i have never done it at such a high caliber but it got better as i went on
5049230 when i crossed the line and saw sherone and kerron there that was the moment
5049231 i tried to follow the pace and follow the strategies i made i feel bad that it didnt go well
5049232 in romania they have always expected a lot from gymnasts especially for gymnastics from this olympics the romanian coaches and athletes have a lot of pressure
5049233 it was really hard to go back into the gym after what happened but i kept training
5049234 i wish i walked away with a medal on pommel horse but im happy that the team got a medal and thats the most important thing to me
5049235 with my set i laid out a hard routine and i wasnt ready
5049236 i wasnt sure how things were going to hold up today but i didnt really care about scores
5049237 i didnt care about placements i just wanted to go out and have a good time sitting there and watching seven other girls compete was the most nerve wracking experience
5049238 not in my best dreams could i have imagined this
5049239 its very special just to compete here ive had an incredible experience with all my countrymen i have to thank everyone that has been here with me the last two weeks
5049240 to be honest it does mean more for me to win it with serena to share this kind of moment with your sister
5049241 i mean we are practically joined at the hip its really unexplainable i have chill bumps
5049242 i want to enjoy my gold medal that ive been working so hard to get this just means so much to me
5049243 today must be the most memorable moment in my life
5049244 i love this sport and id like to go on diving if i can
5049245 we rode a boat called the hunter we hunted everyone all the way down
5049246 you just cant let it get to you there are other things way more important
5049247 im waiting for some really good thing to happen from this because everything happens for a reason
5049248 i didnt feel my finger shaking but i guess it was
5049249 i realized it went off and i hope it made it to the black i call it a freak of nature
5049250 what happened today i think will keep him going keep him determined and he will be more experienced
5049251 but i did not want another loss i let a couple of points go by being lazy but it worked out for me
5049252 i think there is a nation in every sport that dominates
5049253 in games like this if we can get the win in early we will
5049254 its getting us ready for the challenge up ahead it will help us prepare for korea who likes to play at a fast pace and likes to shoot threes
5049255 they practice more than theyre used to theyre focused on themselves and getting better
5049256 for me to be the last one a guy whos been boxing only three years im speechless
5049257 it was no disrespect for the other fighter but it was pointless for me to be in there
5049258 theres no way he hit me 11 times i blocked him he probably scored three or four points but not more than that
5049259 i had a lot of sleepless nights because i was nervous but this allowed me to concentrate more and train harder
5049260 each team we face is just one step that we have to climb but we are very focused on what we came here to do
5049261 in my second snatch i hurt my elbow and the doctor tried to fix it
5049262 i was worried that i could not compete but my coached helped me and gave me confidence he helped me stand up psychologically
5049263 its been a lifelong dream of mine to wrestle in the olympic games i never stopped believing it would happen i want to thank usa wrestling and usa wrestling executive director rich bender for making this happen im looking forward to having an opportunity to wrestle in the olympics and bringing home a gold medal
5049264 the conditions today were quite great britain big wind and big rain we were quite prepared
5049265 i felt very good after that and well play tomorrows game against taiwan in a good mood because of it
5049266 ive got my confidence back and am in a high spirit after that final hit
5049267 the team has very good results but i am a bit disappointed with mine i hope we do better tomorrow
5049268 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
5049269 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
5049270 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
5049271 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
5049272 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
5049273 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government
5049274 i detest what you write but i would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write
5049275 and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too
5049276 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
5049277 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
5049278 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
5049279 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
5049280 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
5049281 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
5049282 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
5049283 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
5049284 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
5049285 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american

5049337 but they kept on going i was like whoa whoa ok it was like a different race and i didnt have an idea it was going to be like that
5049338 i thought they were going to pick it up about 300 meters to go
5049339 but they picked it up a little earlier i wasnt prepared for that but those are great athletes experienced athletes i was thrilled at how they were able to pick it up and keep that pace it became a kicking race it wasnt my day to kick

5049345 we get to talk to people from all over the world they actually go crazy when they see us
5049346 they cant believe this is happening in america that in a big city like fort worth theres a cowboy walking down the street or on the back of a horse
5049347 they have to stick together thats the main thing with the cattle drives
5049348 if we was trying to take two head down the street they would probably run off on us but if we take them all or eight to 10 at least theyll all stick together
5049349 where else can you go to sit on a horse and look cool all day

5049370 but in my view your face is not everything real beauty lies inside a person not outside
5049371 because beauty is all about faces and beautiful girls and skin
5049372 help us bring back a smile to the face of these survivors
5049373 they say that when we come to a beauty salon we come with the expectation that were going to be relaxed in a different frame of mind
5049374 if we come here and we see someone who has gone through so much pain and misery so automatically that gives us that low feeling also they have a point
5049375 at the same time there are clients who take pride in asking these girls to give them a blow dry or getting a manicure or pedicure taken from them
5049376 once we had a wedding in the family i went there and all the girls were getting dressed and putting on makeup so that time i felt a pain in my heart
5049377 but i dont want to weaken myself with these thoughts
5049378 the peace of mind i have now i never had before i suffered much more mental anguish in my married life
5049379 i feel that her hands call me again and again
5049380 when i see them i want to be like them strong girls

5049392 the fire was contained and isolated to the abandoned housing area
5049393 fire personnel were going from house to house to put out any remaining fire
5049394 we couldnt be happier with the support we have received from the local community
5049395 their support helped limit the damage and bring this fire under control

5049397 were trying to get ready were trying to win a gold medal each game is very important to us
5049398 ourselves we are the only obstacle i think we have we have to stay humble and if we play the way weve been playing so hard we should win
5049399 we played an excellent team spain it shows how far we have come
5049400 defensively we were in tune and when we get defensive stops it allows us to get out and run which we do best we just have to continue having the same effort every night we step on the court
5049401 they wanted to make a statement in this game playing against us and they did

5049417 wir haben ber das sicherheitsproblem gesprochen das ist das wichtigste die maschinen werden immer schneller es ist schwer an der sicherheit der strecken zu arbeiten jedes jahr wollen wir mehr platz auslaufzonen und wenn das gemacht wird dann geben die strecken mehr als 80 millionen euro f r sicherheit aus
5049418 es ist unm glich das jedes jahr zu machen denn die strecken haben nicht genug geld um alles jedes jahr zu erneuern deswegen m ssen wir versuchen gute l sungen zu finden nicht um langsamer zu werden aber wegen der sicherheit
5049419 carmelo hat gesagt dass die sicherheit ein problem wird da wir viel an den strecken arbeiten und sie viel geld ausgeben was auch gut ist aber jetzt m ssen wir jedes jahr die auslaufzonen verbessern

5049421 en deze finale is sowieso de bevestiging van het feit dat het enkelspel in de laatste weken goed verloopt
5049422 de resultaten bleven de laatste maanden uit kwestie van steeds n t niet
5049423 toen we die bal kregen wist ik dat ie erin ging
5049424 ik ben heel blij dat ik die bal er op het juiste moment hebben kunnen inslaan we hebben nu alles nog in eigen hand
5049425 ik heb geleerd om elke bal hetzelfde te benaderen het is ook een kwestie van routine geworden al zijn er wel vele uren van training aan vooraf gegaan
5049426 hij is absoluut in vorm hij baalde dat hij bij dat australische doelpunt die man niet had gezien dit was de enige manier om het goed te maken toen we die strafcorner kregen wist ik ook dat ie erin ging
5049427 ik weet hoe het is om individueel olympisch kampioene te worden maar niet hoe dat is met de estafetteploeg ik ben trots op jullie

5049433 unless the country is protected dharma cannot be protected and unless dharma is protected the country cannot be protected
5049434 we all know that somewhere at the top the local terror groups are actively linked with the let huji as well as the pakistans isi it is only a matter of time before the external hand behind the bomb blasts in ahmedabad and possibly some other parts of the country is established
5049435 they would be charged with various offences including murder and waging war against the state
5049436 to unravel such a conspiracy the police of all these states as well as central agencies pooled in information to bust the case in record time i attribute the success to the police
5049437 we have identified the people who stole the cars and the place in mp from where the raw material for the explosives was procured
5049438 a timer holds only for 12 hours while a chip can be timed for a longer interval nevertheless we will soon be able to get to the reason why the surat explosives failed to go off
5049439 with the arrest of mufti abu bashir from azamgarh in uttar pradesh today by a joint team of gujarat police and up police it is probably the first time anyone has reached the brain behind such kind of blasts
5049440 used to inspire terror activities in april he had held a big meeting he had also visited ahmedabad by interrogating him more clues about other blasts that occurred in the country earlier could come out we have uncovered sleeper cells successfully
5049441 i wish to say with full pride that for the last 20 days gujarat police has been progressing on its investigation
5049442 if the police cant tell you something as disclosing something prematurely will harm the investigation there is a weird competition among the media to write stories based on speculation
5049443 those arrested were present during a training camp organised by simi in halol in vadodara distrct in january 2008 they were given training on how to survive in adverse conditions and were trained how to tackle police interrogation
5049444 they were also taught how to drive motorcycle and fake an accident during the camp
5049445 it is very unfortunate that media sometimes over excitedly and unknowingly project things in such a way that helps terrorists and gives them boost sometimes police do not divulge things that will affect the investigation

5049468 we extracted a complete genome from a very complex community and this is something novel
5049469 you can only use amplification when you know what youre trying to get and thats the problem
5049470 when you want to discover something unknown amplification is a very deficient technique because you keep discovering the things you already know so how can you discover the unknown
5049471 these are the bacteria that maintain the earths health some of the methane escapes in some parts of the lake you can see the bubbles but whatever doesnt escape as bubbles these bacteria do a very good job of eating it
5049472 i cant believe i actually won nobody expected me to
5049473 my father always encouraged me to be the best at whatever i do
5049474 but he always humbled me by saying youre never there well today dad youre there
5049475 can i tell you today at the expense of sounding real self righteous i belong here i belong here
5049476 the reality of getting into the pro football hall of fame didnt really hit me until a couple of days ago as there was an overwhelming sense of is this really going to happen and even more so as i stepped up on this stage
5049477 just seeing the magnitude of all this and all of you i appreciate your support
5049478 my personal road to canton is very simple i love playing football
5049479 i never wanted to cheat the fans my organization my teammates or my coaches by not giving my best at all times
5049480 two of these young men are very special to me as you know i had the pleasure of coaching art and darrell in my days with the redskins i broke in with the redskins in 86 and i worked with the receivers under hall of famer joe gibbs and in 87 for the next eight years i worked with darrell on the defensive side both of these men overcame my coaching and have had successful careers and id like to say great job guys
5049481 what i did i went off and left my glasses and i cant see my words
5049482 being raised up in that church by mom and dad being disciplined through their actions some people would consider it abuse
5049483 i didnt want to play linebacker i wanted to be a defensive end
5049484 you know when you get used to it you get used to getting down in the dirt getting your clothes dirty and wallowing a little bit it makes everything come out right when you can stand up out of the mud and feel comfortable
5049485 so i said to myself hmm i like the dirt and if i can beat somebody in this dirt its going to be a good thing
5049486 and it hasnt always been easy along the way what can i say about my mom thank you for teaching me perseverance life wasnt easy for us moving from birmingham alabama to newark new jersey with not much more than the clothes on our back through my mother i learned to be accountable for my actions and understand the consequences of those actions and with that you better believe my mom she made me appreciate understanding whats right and whats wrong she ruled with love and a whole lot of discipline mom i love you and thank you for that
5049487 and this is why theres such a unique bond among us we are an inconspicuous group who defend our quarterbacks as if they were our mothers we open holes for our running backs our job is to make the teams stars shine the o line position is a cohesive unit a collection of individuals if one member of the unit fails we all fail
5049488 its difficult for me to stand up here alone getting this incredible honor there should be a stage full of guys up here standing here receiving this honor with me
5049489 create an environment of trust and prevent any disruptive actions by the enemy
5049490 if you look at folks of color even women theyre more successful in the democratic party than they are in the white uh excuse me in the republican party
5049491 we played well in the first half and their goalkeeper made several good saves to keep them in the match
5049492 our attacking play in the first half was good but as soon as we lost ryan giggs to a hamstring injury and michael carrick with an ankle which is swollen up badly hell be out for two to three weeks we lost a bit of our experience in midfield
5049493 we ended up having to push patrice evra out to the left side of midfield and he is obviously not our best attacking player being a left back
5049494 newcastle were good on the counter attack and in goalscorer obafemi martins and damien duff they have players with quality in these positions if you dont stop them they can be dangerous
5049495 we had possession of the ball but didnt make it count at times but in light of the people we had missing it was a creditable result for us
5049496 it was targeted to a specific audience for specific reasons
5049497 we accomplished that mission and it will continue in another medium
5049498 were thrilled quite frankly it played out exactly how we hoped
5049499 you never can predict how somethings going to do but we felt that the movie is so strong we just needed to get it out there
5049500 were feeling really happy and were really at peace now because youre always a little bit nervous before it all takes place
5049501 were really proud of the boys for having worked so hard and having achieved their goal
5049502 when we saw that they started out in that first 500 metres they had a good start i think one of their best speeds we were feeling i think pretty confident that they would be able to do it
5049503 our speaker got up and just praised brian we were all excited about it
5049504 she was almost running on the spot she was so excited
5049505 weve been very much praying for him and his team
5049506 she was yelling and they were all screaming in the background and they were having a great time and totally celebrating and taking it all in
5049507 they were a much much stronger boat this year theyre such a solid group and theyre determined thats all it takes

5049514 it was in the best interests of the party to disengage from the interim government to allow it to effectively engage with the population with respect to the draft peoples charter as well as prepare for the next general election
5049515 the party joined the interim government on the condition that executive authority would be returned to the president in order to assist in the process of returning fiji to parliamentary democracy through general elections
5049516 an important consideration for the flp becoming a part of the interim government was to save fiji from imminent financial and economic collapse as well as to reform fijis system of governance rid it of corruption and racial discrimination and to promote national unity
5049517 the extent of dods contracting is particularly evident during prolonged large scale operations like those in iraq where there may not be enough military personnel available to provide logistics support
5049518 so much has changed but i have a good crew that ive been working with them for years
5049519 my dad was a carnie my aunt was a carnie my grandpa was a carnie
5049520 but more often concern about his emerging overconfidence which is making it difficult to interact with him
5049521 you might be on the field but you cant see everything out there
5049522 when you watch the tape you see even more that gives everybody a chance to make this team
5049523 the difference between the 53rd player and the 59th player is this big
5049524 because a lot of the coaches here are putting their scheme in and making sure that everybody learns the scheme and knows where theyre supposed to be
5049525 but at the end of the day you could care less about the scheme youre looking at the performance of the individual as a head coach sometimes ive got to watch the practice film three or four times
5049526 you want to see the team and the performance youve got to take some notes because youve got some tough decisions to make
5049527 we might sign a player the seventh or eighth day of camp
5049528 during lunch time a guy might go into a room and watch a meeting
5049529 all you have is that eye in the sky everything thats on the tape everything you do on the field its going to be judged
5049530 when you step on the grass you better do your best
5049531 im getting used to all of the people watching you with their notebooks out you usually see them writing stuff down
5049532 my first year it was definitely a big stress id be looking around wondering if they were writing something down about me am i doing something good am i doing something bad now i know i just worry about what im doing between the lines
5049533 now ive got to put even better stuff on tape
5049534 how can i contribute as a receiver how can i contribute on special teams
5049535 its a whole new ballgame its a whole new season
5049536 youve got to go out there with the thought that everything is being watched
5049537 because they really do have cameras all over the field
5049538 every mistake that you do make youre definitely thinking about it you definitely have to approach practice like its the most important play of your life
5049539 i mean look at a player like me im trying to make the roster i cant slack off on any play ive got to produce on every play if you slack off youre going to be going home
5049540 youve got to be trustworthy i think to be a championship football team
5049541 youve got to be versatile youve got to be able to play a couple of different positions youve got to contribute in the kicking game
5049542 youve got to be a team man you have to understand that clearly all of those things are being evaluated at the end of the day youve got to make plays
5049543 im voting for senator mccain ill do what i can to help him ill do it as good governor we cut taxes were growing jobs lowest unemployment in 30 years but we have more work
5049544 after the president has said that as commander in chief he is ultimately responsible for contractors on the battlefield it is disappointing that his administration has been unwilling to make that interest clear before the courts
5049545 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5049546 we had over 300 copies and customs took all of them from us
5049547 if you look at folks of color even women theyre more successful in the democratic party than they are in the white uh excuse me in the laughs republican party
5049548 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5049549 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5049550 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5049551 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5049552 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5049553 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5049554 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5049555 i think part of the problem in terms of canadians perception of stephane dion has been these attack ads by the conservative government perhaps they have had somewhat of an impact
5049556 the polls seem to indicate a neck and neck race and i think the campaign is going to make a difference i dont think for a second that people have given up on stephane dion
5049557 i do think its fair to say that in the past few months and particularly over the summer we have seen increasing signs that this parliament is really not working very well anymore its becoming increasingly dysfunctional
5049558 i dont think voters appreciate bairds abrasive style his caustic approach to politics i think they see him as almost a hyper partisan someone who puts partisanship ahead of good government
5049559 it was targeted to a specific audience for specific reasons
5049560 we accomplished that mission and it will continue in another medium
5049561 were thrilled quite frankly it played out exactly how we hoped
5049562 you never can predict how somethings going to do but we felt that the movie is so strong we just needed to get it out there
5049563 were feeling really happy and were really at peace now because youre always a little bit nervous before it all takes place
5049564 were really proud of the boys for having worked so hard and having achieved their goal
5049565 when we saw that they started out in that first 500 metres they had a good start i think one of their best speeds we were feeling i think pretty confident that they would be able to do it
5049566 our speaker got up and just praised brian we were all excited about it
5049567 she was almost running on the spot she was so excited
5049568 weve been very much praying for him and his team
5049569 she was yelling and they were all screaming in the background and they were having a great time and totally celebrating and taking it all in
5049570 they were a much much stronger boat this year theyre such a solid group and theyre determined thats all it takes
5049571 it was targeted to a specific audience for specific reasons
5049572 we accomplished that mission and it will continue in another medium
5049573 were thrilled quite frankly it played out exactly how we hoped
5049574 you never can predict how somethings going to do but we felt that the movie is so strong we just needed to get it out there
5049575 it was amazing to win that much the best and worst time of my life in equal measure the most frightening and exciting
5049576 we both said sport was our nemesis and then we get it first question
5049577 its really weird when youre sat there in the studio
5049578 i rang him straight away after the recording to tell him we had won 50 000 he couldnt believe it
5049579 it means so much because all our money for mood swings comes from our own fundraising efforts
5049580 thats why i was so desperate to go on millionaire
5049581 its such a unique charity and we will spend every last penny on things that really matter
5049582 the girls did good im proud of them and the money is absolutely unbelievable
5049583 it was nerve wracking on the end of that phone
5049584 well never raise enough to do all the things we want to do but 25 000 will mean that people in sometimes desperate need will get the help and support they require
5049585 anything that can help towards finding a cure for cancer can only be good
5049586 wordsworths line earth has not anything to show more fair was inspired by a view from which bridge
5049587 after we filmed the show i was down in london and drove over westminster bridge twice
5049588 i rang my dad and said youll never guess where i am looking at the view ill never forget it now
5049589 its also about giving your charity the publicity and raising its profile

5049747 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop
5049748 it was magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 percent wide open
5049749 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5049750 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5049751 we historically dont make our decisions within a 24 hour period it takes time to get everybody in a group and talk about it
5049752 let me just say that first and foremost that that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys there at jgr
5049753 i want to apologize to nascar to our partners to toyota guys a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5049754 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were
5049755 for us we kind of feel like in the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and chief engine builder mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5049756 the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped to come back and win it again thats awesome
5049757 thats a great story that wasnt able to be told
5049758 well figure out exactly what happened and those that were responsible
5049759 theres going to be punishment for that thats just part of life you cant do that
5049760 you got to take care of this to move on
5049761 you cant look at this game and think we played well and were going to move on its about what we do in two days
5049762 they hit a lot of 3s and love to drive and kickout for the open shot
5049763 i just happen to be in the right place at the right time
5049764 i actually thought that i missed a lot of shots early that i usually hit
5049765 i think most of us grew up watching these girls i think i was 10 years old when lisa leslie played in her first olympics it was a good experience i think we played pretty well all things considered
5049766 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

5049768 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5049769 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5049770 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5049771 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5049772 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5049800 it was targeted to a specific audience for specific reasons
5049801 we accomplished that mission and it will continue in another medium
5049802 all opened around those levels and went on to become 100 million hits
5049803 were thrilled quite frankly it played out exactly how we hoped
5049804 you never can predict how somethings going to do but we felt that the movie is so strong we just needed to get it out there

5049809 when i was thinking about it i was getting ahead of myself
5049810 weve been waiting on this so many great athletes have come so close
5049811 it was a flagrant and a blatant false start that was not recalled and had tremendous impact on the race
5049812 but theyre not going to rerun the olympic 100 anyone who knows anything knows that
5049813 there was a lot of boxing and a lot of pushing
5049814 i was worried about someone going down i gave everything i had

5049816 but we assume nobody will press the issue with blount county to seek further clarification and they will do whatever they want to do as usual
5049817 since the story broke of potential recount challenges by both candidate barnes and rep davis a couple of things have happened
5049818 what is funny is that in 1984 the soviet union was on the brink of collapse they were a paper tiger not a bear in the woods so in that regard hobbs comparison is fairly accurate
5049819 oh and just to pour salt in the wounds of tirrc crafton is proposing an interpreter fee for those who need language services but remember his wife is japanese and his brother in law is hispanic so its ok
5049820 t he prospect of shorter lines in minority areas and easier access to vote is keeping some gop officials up late at night

5049827 oh my aching head if we werent stuck inside the borders of a giant insane asylum cnn would be laughed off the air

5049847 his dad had warned all of his kids from going in these mine shafts
5049848 never again will we have a cold backup of anything

5049868 to be silver medallist im really happy it was a challenging time coming to these olympics
5049869 its about time weve been waiting for this so many great athletes have come so close and we were able to pull it off tonight
5049870 man i swear somebody jumped someone got out before the gun
5049871 i think i moved a bit there at the start and i thought they would call it
5049872 i think i false started i moved a little bit my foot
5049873 about 50 metres out i glimpsed to the sides and smiled then i powered through the line
5049874 vai ser dif cil cantar sem ele tive sorte muito grande de ter um pai j burra velha
5049875 vai o homem mas a obra dele fica para sempre
5049876 atrav s de sua m sica e de sua sensibilidade caymmi projetou o brasil para o mundo metade do brasil hoje est chorando e sofrendo caymmi foi essa luz maravilhoso ver este corpo estendido dentro do caix o n o d para a gente se conformar d uma sensa o de impot ncia muito grande sabemos que ele vai ao encontro dos amigos mas n o d para se conformar ele foi um grande exemplo e deixa um grande e valioso recado
5049877 ele um grande compositor com aquele jeito baiano dele mas pelo que a fam lia me falou ele foi em paz do jeito que ele queria mas a gente lamenta mais um bom brasileiro que vai um bom companheiro
5049878 caymmi foi muito generoso com a m sica um lenda brasileira um buda baiano
5049879 sinto saudade e falta do amigo a rela o dele com a mangueira foi um casamento perfeito dando o primeiro lugar em 1986 n o era s um compositor de can es adorava o mar e as pessoas era um exemplo de vida

5049883 because of the great emphasis on harmony and family integration in many asian cultures family conflict is an important factor to consider when studying suicidal behaviors among asian americans
5049884 our study suggests that we need to more precisely determine the kinds of family conflicts that are associated with suicide risk among asian americans and find means of preventing these family problems
5049885 this is the first nationally representative investigation of family conflict and suicidal behaviors among asian americans
5049886 our findings suggest that high family conflict has an independent and additive effect in predicting lifetime suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts among asian americans
5049887 free radicals from tobacco smoke have long been suspected of having extremely harmful effects on the body
5049888 based on our work we now know that free radicals similar to those in cigarettes are also found in airborne fine particles and potentially can cause many of the same life threatening conditions this is a staggering but not unbelievable result when one considers all of diseases in the world that cannot currently be attributed to a specific origin
5049889 you basically have to be in certain places to inhale transient gas phase radicals
5049890 youd have to be right next to a road when a car passes for example whereas we found that persistent radicals can last indefinitely on airborne fine particles so youre never going to get away from them

5049894 can a pro life christian never vote for a pro choice person
5049895 to reflect on some of the assumptions in your post you might run with different 20somethings than i run with but the case of obamamania somehow sweeping over and placing into a hypnotic trance young evangelicals who are otherwise astute and thoughtful far overstates the case its more basic than that the problem is that our options are so terribly limited because we live in the city of man while longing for the city of god to come in its fullness
5049896 just you wait as soon as i figure out how to lift weights with no opposable thumbs im going to get so strong and then ill burst out of here watch out des moines
5049897 we know we are more than just neurons firing or at least we think we are while the neurons are firing
5049898 when i crossed the line and saw sherone and kerron there that was the moment i wouldnt trade it for anything else
5049899 oh my god that is too much the secret of the teams success reggae power
5049900 i wanted to come out and do the same thing
5049901 i wasnt aware of anything going on about the false start i just heard about it after i finished
5049902 she was closer to me so i felt the false start but the race is over there is nothing we can do about it jamaica came out on top
5049903 i cant say it hurt me because i got a medal
5049904 it means a great deal for jamaica so many women before us came so close
5049905 its a great accomplishment coming into the olympics people thought we werent as experienced give us a chance we make the best of it
5049906 were trying to get ready were trying to win a gold medal each game is very important to us
5049907 ourselves we are the only obstacle i think we have we have to stay humble and if we play the way weve been playing so hard we should win
5049908 we played an excellent team spain it shows how far we have come
5049909 defensively we were in tune and when we get defensive stops it allows us to get out and run which we do best we just have to continue having the same effort every night we step on the court
5049910 they wanted to make a statement in this game playing against us and they did
5049911 we really thought we had a good chance to have at least one guy in that final
5049912 youre always surprised when a great athlete doesnt make the finals
5049913 i thought man ive got to dig deep today to get in
5049914 i tried to maintain that get into the fifth spot but didnt make it you know what life goes on
5049915 who spent 10 years in a kenyan refugee camp carried the u s flag in the opening ceremony he too was not expressing disappointment womens quarterfinals usas branagh youngs vs china women 100m and steeplechase finals
5049916 we really thought we had a good chance to have at least one guy in that final
5049917 youre always surprised when a great athlete doesnt make the finals
5049918 i thought man ive got to dig deep today to get in
5049919 i tried to maintain that get into the fifth spot but didnt make it you know what life goes on
5049920 there is the collectivist bullshit about new zealand winning like every fat prick in a lazyboy had anything to do with it
5049921 but the point is we have now had technological advances over the last 20 or 30 years in communications that are remarkable its a remarkable ability that our enemies have to communicate so we have to keep up with that capability i mean there is too many ways and through cyberspace and through other ways that people are able to communicate with one another so we are going to have to step up our capabilities to monitor those sometimes there are calls from outside the united states inside the united states there is all kinds of communications of every different kind so you need congress to work together you need a judiciary that will review these laws that we pass and at the same time its just an example of our failure to sit down republican and democrat and work these things out
5049922 this is a continuum that started back on 9 11 to reform law enforcement and the intelligence community to focus on the terrorism threat
5049923 it moves what the rules were from 1993 to the new world we live in but it maintains civil liberties
5049924 provide specialized equipment technical knowledge or assistance of expert personnel
5049925 if properly implemented this should assure the public that people are not being investigated by agencies who are not trained in how to protect constitutional rights
5049926 the fbi will need to be vigilant both in its policies and its practices to live up to that promise
5049927 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information
5049928 it turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government
5049929 in the right direction however the vagueness of the provisions giving broad access to criminal intelligence to undefined agencies is very troubling
5049930 if the dressing is too acidic for your taste add a pinch of salt if you prefer to make a vegan caesar dressing replace the anchovy with 2 tsp tamari 1o ml and omit the cheese

5049934 the goal was to start sectarian violence with the car bombs
5049935 there used to be a whole brigade here and now its less soon these policies will backfire in tal afar and allow terrorists to come in
5049936 we used to depend mostly on coalition forces but unfortunately the footprint of the u s has been reduced
5049937 frankly we dont trust the iraqi police one hundred percent
5049938 when the aug 8 bomb went off in tal afar the police joined with the civilians to attack sunnis when we didnt join the fight they called us terrorists
5049939 as the iraqi units stood up over the past 18 months they took over our bases
5049940 we confirmed that they could operate in company and battalion strength
5049941 it has a golf course and all of the amenities
5049942 there are no plans to build a wall there if the wall is so important for security then why are we skipping parts
5049943 but in my view your face is not everything real beauty lies inside a person not outside
5049944 because beauty is all about faces and beautiful girls and skin
5049945 help us bring back a smile to the face of these survivors
5049946 they say that when we come to a beauty salon we come with the expectation that were going to be relaxed in a different frame of mind
5049947 if we come here and we see someone who has gone through so much pain and misery so automatically that gives us that low feeling also they have a point
5049948 at the same time there are clients who take pride in asking these girls to give them a blow dry or getting a manicure or pedicure taken from them
5049949 once we had a wedding in the family i went there and all the girls were getting dressed and putting on makeup so that time i felt a pain in my heart
5049950 but i dont want to weaken myself with these thoughts
5049951 the peace of mind i have now i never had before i suffered much more mental anguish in my married life
5049952 i feel that her hands call me again and again

5049954 i want to make a name for myself in this profession
5049955 im independent now i stand on my own two feet

5049976 i suspect that a large number of people who open it would very quickly do what i did which is say this is scurrilous stuff and throw it away

5049987 the european grand prix around the port area of valencia is new to the programme this year we are very much looking forward to the race and the city particularly as bmw has some close associations with valencia
