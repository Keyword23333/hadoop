6700002 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6700003 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6700004 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6700005 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6700006 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6700007 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6700008 una grave falta tica si estos productos son reorientados a otros mercados donde no hay controles respecto a estas extremadamente peligrosas sustancias t xicas

6700011 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
6700012 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6700013 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6700014 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6700015 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6700016 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6700017 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6700018 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6700019 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6700020 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6700021 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6700022 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6700023 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6700024 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6700025 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6700026 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6700027 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6700028 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6700029 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6700030 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6700031 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6700032 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6700033 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6700034 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6700035 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6700036 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6700037 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6700038 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6700039 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6700040 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6700041 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6700042 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6700043 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6700044 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6700045 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6700046 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6700047 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6700048 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6700049 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6700050 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6700051 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6700052 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6700053 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad

6700056 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6700057 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6700058 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6700059 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6700060 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6700061 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6700062 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano

6700066 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa

6700073 it is surprising how many people think it was ok for this nerd to hack into computers
6700074 i suppose they also think that virus making and spamming are just harmless pastimes as well clearly his supporters dont have computers or brains
6700075 i have no time for gary mckinnon and think his activities were despicable and deserving of some punishment but not in a us court
6700076 america will not allow its citizens to be tried outside the us legal system so by the same token we should not let them try british citizens in their courts
6700077 if a crime was committed it was committed in the us irrespective of where mckinnon was sitting at the time
6700078 this man is indeed accused of committing offences in america 97 of them in fact offences that are committed electronically are offences regardless of the location of the person who commits them

6700087 we are truly grateful to edwin because this could have never happened without him
6700088 there was just no way we would have ever been able to raise the money
6700089 we usually raise money for our trips by selling water and boxes of m amp ms outside but we were trying to do it in december and it was just too cold
6700090 i didnt think we were going to be able to do it it was just too much money
6700091 what we gave wasnt much but it got the ball rolling and that was great
6700092 the wall had been closed for seven days so when we got there there were just so many people there that they didnt think it was safe for us to play
6700093 they were being very careful about our safety especially after the stabbing on the first night of the olympics
6700094 this was just a phenomenal experience for all of us
6700095 it was a cultural exchange and an adventure and none of us will ever forget it

6700098 keo mentioned how much pressure he felt because the community was behind it
6700099 and how if he would have went there and things wouldnt have gone right
6700100 sometimes at lunchtime i sit down to eat and the students ask and i have to answer it
6700101 thats the only way i learn when you get old you hardly remember things and if you have a kid asking over and over and over you will be remembering
6700102 it took me twenty some years to get over it
6700103 they said was a root that they pull out so it dont grow back
6700104 walk straight on the road i walk around all the boulders and mountains and stuff
6700105 when keo came in and the kids had been told ahead of time for the first time what was going on they just cheered
6700106 it was so cool because they just have such a great relationship with him they really wanted him to succeed
6700107 it was one of those things where you say hey you know one of our janitors a guy youve been seeing every day let me tell you a little bit about his story and what he went through
6700108 i got mixed up with the one that was when the declaration of independence was written i missed on that one but thats it
6700109 i cant wait to process the data from this internet gambling free zones survey and see where everything stands
6700110 im excited to be releasing news about recent internet gambling free zones item developments
6700111 and we believe this new institution of higher learning will have a great impact
6700112 dont get left out in the cold when it comes to internet gambling free zones technology
6700113 get good deals and second hand hardware when you can
6700114 but whatever you do get one of these internet gambling free zones products while supplies last
6700115 may god help us as a nation to do what is right
6700116 we cant at this point know exactly what took place in terms of the overflow
6700117 we are working on some protocols internally that will be followed in the case of a future spill
6700118 basically they deal with notification of the health department and down stream communities we will be working with those communities to determine the best methods and procedures for notification in the event of a spill
6700119 we wanted to give them plenty of time to get with downstream communities and get all that hashed out
6700120 we figured kalamazoo was as far downstream as theyll need to go
6700121 were still conducting our investigation but at this point we are not seeing this in any way as a cover up
6700122 once we complete our investigation well determine if theres any appropriate discipline we need to address
6700123 theyve had an excellent track record of reporting these types of events before this event and after it as well
6700124 we are continuing to investigate with the city what happened were not in a position right now to discuss what any penalties might be
6700125 i know multiple times each year the phone fax and e mail is down
6700126 he aint talked to me hes talkin to ollie and i aint gonna sit up til 2 waiting on his ass we can talk tomorrow
6700127 i dont think the majority of them would i would not
6700128 terry doesnt get the respect he deserves weve all got respect for him and hes like a second dad to me hes fantastic and all the rubbish he gets is not fair
6700129 terry sat us down and explained it all to us and its a load of rubbish to be honest all were here for is to win gold medals everything is fine and it will be sorted out when we get back
6700130 this has been coming for a long time and my skin is getting thicker and thicker i came here to do a job and they the aba obviously came here to do some sort of other job
6700131 i dont know what their agenda is but i know what my agenda is and thats to get guys through to the final i just find the timing of it all unbelievable if there are grievances they should be dealt with but at the right time
6700132 on my day i can beat anybody in the world
6700133 he aint talked to me hes talkin to ollie and i aint gonna sit up til 2 waiting on his ass we can talk tomorrow
6700134 he aint talked to me hes talkin to ollie and i aint gonna sit up til 2 waiting on his ass we can talk tomorrow
6700135 i was just floating out there carli and i both came a long way
6700136 but this was kind of another once in a lifetime thing
6700137 i have to say after the first game i didnt know that the gold medal would be possible
6700138 he turned me into a machine its funny looking back five years ago i could never run long distances he started out with a 15 minute run i said this is long i got up to a hour and a half
6700139 i told her a number of times that shes by far the best goalkeeper in the world
6700140 and if she goes by you youre not going to catch her so for us we were trying to keep her outside more than anything
6700141 for sure she really got into that ball very well i think actually it had a certain move to the ball right
6700142 vindicated i dont even think about that whatever i said last year im just enjoying this moment right now i feel great i just won a gold medal
6700143 this game i had a different feeling usually the nerves are going theres anxiety right up until the whistle blows to start the game something felt different
6700144 grace is always getting better and had a personal best 79 in a round that included six 3 putts recently
6700145 our goal definitely is to get back to state for the sixth straight season
6700146 weve played nine kids so far in invitationals and meets with several of the girls shooting really fine scores during 54 holes of play at traverse city area invitationals recently where a lot of the elite teams in the state were at
6700147 so while tonys team at lakeview is strong and is going to be the team to beat in the conference i think were going to be up there too and have our own share of successes in regionals and state at the division 3 level
6700148 lakeview and marshall are certainly the top two teams in our conference this season and i see us and sturgis and harper creek fighting it out for third place
6700149 so as long as we keep working hard and keep putting in the effort were hopefully going to keep getting better as the season goes along
6700150 were still experiencing a bit of a numbers problem right now because some of my kids havent been able to play regularly because of summer work schedules but once school starts were going to have everybody on board and thats a really really good feeling
6700151 we now basically have one returnee two sophomores a couple freshmen and one junior giving us a full team
6700152 im just excited that we have a full team again and im excited that all of these kids are doing something better every day were out there
6700153 this is great to see all these fine young players out for this years team
6700154 its just a wonderful situation to have both battle creek central and pennfield supplying players for this team its a perfect blend for us theres strength in the diversity of the players were getting from both schools and i couldnt be happier with the way this team has been put together
6700155 our theme this year is run with the pack weve got nine very talented players packed in there 1 through 9 and all are playing well and fighting for spots in any given starting lineup and when you add it all up weve got 27 years of varsity experience overall among the players on this team
6700156 instead of just meeting their immediate needs you need to frame it as a business issue how do we solve the problem
6700157 between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not
6700158 but one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6700159 a little testy on this issue let me be clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment
6700160 when one of these factors jump up theres a tendency for everybody to say ah ha thats because of the casino
6700161 well have to wait two three or even four years before we see a change in the social fabric in the county
6700162 peacekeepers at special checkpoints in the quantities needed to ensure security will remain
6700163 there will be no buffer zones we will never live with any buffer zones well never allow anything like this
6700164 there are some checkpoints where one day they are federal troops and the next day peacekeepers
6700165 hes a humble guy but i know its my job to get the guy the baton and i didnt do that
6700166 its kind of the way its been happening to me this olympics
6700167 if people want to assess the blame to me thats ok
6700168 i mean i can take whatever it is that people are going to dish out we had good chemistry the hand was back there she was there i dont know what happened
6700169 i dont know what to say i ran the best i could
6700170 this is definitely a heartbreaking way to end my international career
6700171 he aint talked to me hes talkin to ollie and i aint gonna sit up til 2 waiting on his ass we can talk tomorrow
6700172 thats just another reason why we play in bathing suits
6700173 were going to take this journey together too we have to make the team of the future
6700174 i feel like we still have unfinished business but were not moms yet we dont know how thats going to change us
6700175 taking a baby on the road might not be the best thing for the baby
6700176 i get off the plane wearing whatever clothes i have for one night in arizona
6700177 then im gone for a few weeks i havent seen matt since july 17 the all star break
6700178 id like to spend more than one night at a time with my husband id like to come home and ask whats for dinner instead of just making something for myself
6700179 we havent sat down and had a heart to heart about it
6700180 its up in the air i cant imagine playing beach volleyball without misty may i hope thats the way it works out that we have our families and then we get back together its special what we have
6700181 shes this little freshman and she scores two goals against us both of them off her head
6700182 it was such a proud moment to think about how far she has come and the impact south jersey girls soccer has had on the world
6700183 that was one of our own over there scoring the game winning goal to give the usa the gold medal
6700184 she worked on her own to get incredibly fit flexible and strong to become a complete player
6700185 lloyd is such an asset to the team that many times i come away thinking shes the best player on the pitch and thats not just for the usa but for everyone
6700186 we ran a camp at moorestown this summer and carli came out and she was great with the girls encouraging them signing autographs doing whatever she could to help out
6700187 i know these athletes usually get paid for things like that but she wouldnt take a dime
6700188 its a great opportunity to be back to a place that is near and dear to my heart
6700189 i wasnt very happy to leave under the circumstances i left through the years wherever ive been ive had people comment about the philly days and people saying i never should have left that team
6700190 bringing elton brand in was huge because they missed that big presence in the middle
6700191 playing against them you could see they didnt have that go to guy down low that could sink the defense in
6700192 i can still do a little something on the court
6700193 churandy martina wins the americans on the track but got beat on paper
6700194 as we were studying the video for wallace it was brought to our attention that there may have been a violation in lane 6
6700195 we saw the violation and appealed that result we then went through the rules process we wanted to make sure that the results of the race were fair
6700196 will you call the white house and talk of this with mr bush
6700197 a small country like ours we did not come here as victims
6700198 i think its a pity for a big country like the united states to make such a small statement
6700199 how is it possible that officials didnt know there had been a technical mistake
6700200 the u s have the right to protest but why when officials disqualified spearmon did they not notice churandys violation
6700201 they cant see if he stepped on or over a white line i dont understand it if i stood on the line then why did the jury not disqualify me at the same time as spearmon it was at least 90 minutes before they told me i was disqualified
6700202 for me the highs and lows of watching that game were gut wrenching
6700203 i was out of my seat in the locker room
6700204 i was into it im a fan and i care a lot about heather i was more emotional watching that game than i am playing in one of my own they werent expected to win that game and heather after her injury wasnt supposed to be on that team so for her to be on that roster and to play and have them win it i couldnt be any prouder
6700205 ive talked to heather a couple times since she sent me the text
6700206 i know theyre exhausted but i imagine theyll find some energy to celebrate
6700207 to have someone of genes age and the way he carried himself to all of a sudden receive a phone call that gene has passed away was a huge shock to me from where the union started to where it is today is leaps and bounds a lot of that credit has to go to gene and what he stood for
6700208 with the backing of the players he was able to get us in a pretty good position in terms of health benefits with help from the presidents at the time be it troy and trace armstrong
6700209 its been no secret that this has been troys ambition for a while
6700210 gene made some strong statements about not planning to leave im sure a number of people will want the position but i think troy will be high on the list of qualified people
6700211 troy is the kind of guy who can make things happen
6700212 he was a very competent president and a very involved president he took the job extremely seriously and handled the position as well as anyone has my initial gut reaction is that troy has a pretty good chance of getting the job
6700213 weve hit for the last 31 2 years we have a lot of the same guys i know they can hit but i cant exactly tell you when were going to get going
6700214 its a little surprising but its probably out of my jurisdiction
6700215 without a doubt i think every guy in that room in there knows were better than how weve been playing
6700216 teams know hes a strike thrower and hell make the adjustment
6700217 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game
6700218 his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6700219 gene always believed the best way to build the popularity of our sport was to craft a dynamic partnership between the players and the owners that served the best interest of the fans
6700220 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6700221 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but didnt always do so he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6700222 a lot of hits he took were because a lot of people couldnt believe this black former football player was accomplishing what he was accomplishing
6700223 and we all know what a deal the last deal was and thats why the owners got out of it i dont think he ever got the credit he shouldve gotten for that because of the lack of acrimony between him and tagliabue and the last two years
6700224 the further you get away from how they led up to the deal and you look back and you realize what the union came away with i think that becomes the legacy the one big piece that i think was still in the process was this idea of the broader issue of retired players how you take care of them with injuries and the like it is kind of a sad additional piece to think about that he too becomes someone who dies young football players die young it keeps happening
6700225 he has meant a tremendous amount to the players union and was pivotal in creating the stature and footing they have today
6700226 we have knocked heads recently over issues relating to the treatment of former nfl players and the execution of the current disability system i disagreed with gene with regard the fact that there are major flaws in the disability program and on the nflpas treatment of retired players the problem still exists and needs to be addressed but today is not the time to talk about those issues or the future it is a time to extend condolences to his family
6700227 his plan and his focus were to make it back this year
6700228 obviously he worked extremely hard to put himself in this position
6700229 i tried to pull back and get out of the way when i saw the ball it was about a foot away
6700230 estoy muy feliz de llegar a un gran club como el olympiacos que ha hecho un importante esfuerzo por ficharme quiero darle las gracias al club por su paciencia y lo quiero hacer d ndolo todo en el campo
6700231 i want him just to go out there and be himself and have the composure that hes always had and throw strikes
6700232 if somebody hits the ball hard keep working keep working on what he does best thats how hes been doing it for a year and a half now
6700233 its like hitters in a slump its just something that pitchers go through where all of a sudden you are trying to pitch away from contact
6700234 i dont know why it happens its just something im going to be really conscious of going out there tonight attacking the strike zone getting ahead getting strike one and strike two and making them hit my pitch instead of falling behind 2 0 and obviously they know a fastball is coming
6700235 i think its very important that you have to show a lot of confidence in him
6700236 if you look hes been real good for us because hes gotten hit a few games doesnt mean that i have to show that im concerned about him
6700237 i just know i need to make every start possible wherever it lines up it lines up i think the matchups are more for the playoffs than anything during the season matchups are pretty irrelevant because you play teams so often and because we have five guys who i believe every single one will get the job done
6700238 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it
6700239 what is more scandalous is that it is not the first time that the government has been shown to be completely incapable of protecting the integrity of highly sensitive data rendering them unfit to be charged with protecting our safety
6700240 they are trying to give a signal that they can hit at any defense installation
6700241 and they are intensifying the pressure on the civilian government to stop the bajaur operation
6700242 o actual sil ncio da direc o do psd est errado errado porque um pa s em dificuldades n o foi de f rias e precisava de ouvir a voz de uma oposi o alternativa
6700243 im telling people the stick had a mind of its own
6700244 it was my fault i take full blame for it
6700245 i felt it hit my hand but i dont think it was in all the way before i grabbed and then when i went to grab he had already let go
6700246 ive never dropped a stick in my life its kind of upsetting
6700247 the 400 meters is a race about confidence heart intelligence and you cant back down
6700248 and thats why i have this medal around my neck right now
6700249 never in my wildest dreams would i have thought i would have scored the goal that gave us the gold medal
6700250 i told her a number of times that she is by far the best goalkeeper in the world
6700251 that game today is leaving people now scratching their heads about her
6700252 most of the goal was open to my left so i started leaning to my left but marta tried shooting to the right
6700253 it was a reaction save but thats what i get paid for
6700254 i just knew i had to keep it low and hit it hard it went in
6700255 if it wasnt for her there would definitely have been some goals in the back of the net
6700256 obviously this is a place that i held near and dear to my heart
6700257 i wasnt very happy to leave under the circumstances that i left
6700258 wherever ive been throughout the world and even overseas ive had people comment about the philly days they are always saying you should have never left that team and different things in that nature i told my wife why not go back why not come back to philly because i had great years there we met there got married there and started our life there
6700259 being that senior guy that guy that can do a little something on the court to be able to provide extra help off the bench
6700260 thats one of the things that some of the veterans always told me dont leave before youre ready to leave leave on your own terms dont leave before youre ready to leave because once you leave youre done its not going to be around anymore
6700261 i still feel like i have enough capabilities to be out on the floor to be able to help a team that is fighting to try to get to playoffs and make some noise i still get that urge it rejuvenated when i got back to detroit being in that situation being around a great organization
6700262 were capable of hitting weve hit for the last 3 1 2 years and have a lot of the same guys i know we can hit but i cant tell you when its going to get going i think every guy in that room knows we can play better
6700263 i think our guys know exactly what they have to do
6700264 they know where we are at how many games we have to go and what we need to do to win
6700265 i dont want fans to get on him for my situation
6700266 we continue to put ourselves in position day in and day out to win games
6700267 we have a good team we have good chemistry a lot of things are really working in our favor right now
6700268 it was a big win for us were really confident weve been able to find a way to win ballgames that is something we werent doing early in the year
6700269 doubleplay wed get wright at second too he had taken off he was halfway home cant fault him i mean ball gets in the lights you cant see it
6700270 we just have to continue playing good baseball and let things happen the way they have been happening
6700271 they were good last year and gave us everything we wanted last year with a backup quarterback
6700272 hes doing great wouldnt you 60 million richer hes doing wonderful
6700273 if hes injured he cant play so we cant do anything about that
6700274 we have to get better as a team without him
6700275 our players are going to russia to play the chinese are coming to the wnba theres no borders anymore becky made a great business decision and had a great olympic experience
6700276 i stand on if youre an american you have the right to do whatever you want
6700277 for the most part americans are always doing things that people dont like it really is a tough subject becky is a great person and a tremendous basketball player it was a tough decision for her
6700278 i represent the usa and this is the only uniform ill ever put on i had no idea i was going to make this team i was on the bubble i was one of the last three players named if i made it wonderful if i didnt id cheer for my country to win a gold medal
6700279 to me its no different from australian tom maher coaching china my teammates disagree theyre not the first people to do it it has been done for years its nothing that i would do
6700280 the generations have changed the cold war is a distant memory if its a memory at all for our players for this generation
6700281 she thinks shes so westernized just because she plays a bourgeois sport
6700282 off a slow pace like that you cant be surprised when these girls come up on you you have to be ready to go and i didnt have it to go
6700283 coming off the curve i was actually in a pretty good position she said
6700284 it actually really opened up thats whats so disappointing i saw daylight and really went backwards instead of staying up and staying loose i got tight and that was it
6700285 the olympics in front of thousands i wanted it really bad
6700286 maybe im just not as fit as i thought i was she said
6700287 yeah i got nothing else going on so why not
6700288 i felt like id do a lot better than this
6700289 when you practice and youre out there by yourself and you just want to turn it on and go you just go
6700290 im really disappointed in how flat i was in the last 200 meters
6700291 a lot of people dont understand that in running you practice different things just like a basketball team practices different plays you practice different segments of a race i really practiced closing it didnt work out well
6700292 ive got nothing else going on so i might as well
6700293 the other girls were just more ready to go it might just be one bad race its a shame it had to come at the olympics
6700294 aside from the disappointment of not making it and being under pressure for two weeks it was an amazing experience
6700295 the first group will go about three quarters and then well see how it goes from there
6700296 were going to give tony an opportunity there and see how he does
6700297 if we like what we see then well give him a little bit more if we dont then well move on to something else
6700298 o actual sil ncio da direc o do psd est errado errado porque um pa s em dificuldades n o foi de f rias e precisava de ouvir a voz de uma oposi o alternativa
6700299 good news is theres nothing wrong with my eyesight the bad news is i just flat out stink right now
6700300 id have probably had him get rid of it the first day
6700301 but then i wouldnt have been there the next day
6700302 its a different era an altogether different era from when i managed six teams from 1967 to 1988
6700303 we thought about all the security detail and all of the stuff shed have to worry about and we just wanted her to focus she knew we loved her and she took that to beijing thats good enough for me
6700304 we cant wait to see her i mean they are already talking about doing something big in town
6700305 its unbelievable i mean as a parent this is something you dream about happening to your child so this really is a dream come true
6700306 its been great people have been riding by honking and waving and we have been on the phone much of the day with family and friends
6700307 everyone has been so nice and really appreciative of what carli has done its almost like a personal victory for the town
6700308 the first thing i thought to myself after watching her score that goal was i told you
6700309 so when she texted me after the game to thank me i told you was my only reply
6700310 i said come home relax and get ready to build a better you
6700311 she wants to be the best player in the world and we are still striving to get to that point
6700312 on paper for you guys its probably a team that we should beat
6700313 theyre competitive they didnt back down i think at all in this series regardless of what their record is they are professional baseball players and they are going to give you a battle
6700314 they got some breaks and took advantage of them tonight
6700315 its a little surprising but its probably out of my jurisdiction
6700316 im not a hitter so youre probably asking the wrong guy
6700317 all of a sudden it seems like we cant get anything going
6700318 it seems like everything we do doesnt work for us i think our guys know exactly what they have to do and they know how many games we have left and they know where were at and they know what we have to do to win i think were definitely trying
6700319 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it
6700320 i was not expecting anything like this i thought it was going to be a few girls from the gym and coaches
6700321 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
6700322 does it matter if weve lost 10 in a row to the marlins if we beat them in the last eight
6700323 no the only thing that matters is the last game you win the next win thats all that matters we dont care how weve played against people
6700324 i think the guys are up for the challenge they know august and september is what separates the boys from the men theyre looking forward to payback we lost our first series to the dodgers in l a i think weve got to take care of home field advantage hopefully this time it goes our way but as far as our record with things weve done before we cant control that its over and done with
6700325 any help we would get would likely come from within the system
6700326 when i got into coaching i always dreamed of getting to the nba this opportunity was unbelievable
6700327 you travel youre in the gym youre working with everybody a lot of times im going to be working with some of the younger guys its developing guys that theyre investing millions of dollars in
6700328 he is one of the games bright young coaches and made a great impact on our program
6700329 we will miss him but its always exciting when a member of our staff has the chance to pursue their dream and this opportunity in houston allows brett to do that
6700330 i feel people should get off our back and realize theres some parity in this game
6700331 it closes the book on a very very sad tragedy
6700332 unfortunately those who are still alive will always suffer from his actions
6700333 youre probably thinking a normal teenager doesnt do this well ask dick
6700334 but she had been with her daughter that morning and was thinking if god forbid something happened to her daughter that someone would come forward and do the right thing
6700335 at the end of the day there was no way i was not going to put this girl first before whatever damage might be done to me
6700336 he suansing should name names and present proofs this is a very serious allegation and if he is claiming facts and not speculations the house is prepared to discipline our members
6700337 i just hope that lto chief suansing can back this up with facts because as far as i know the lto is the only government agency that sells issues and distributes all vehicle plates including security plates and protocol plates
6700338 and as far i know also it is the lto that sells these security plates protocol plates and diplomatic plates to unauthorized vehicle owners im really glad that lto chief suansing opened this up because now we have a basis to conduct an investigation
6700339 theres a failure of leadership at the lto because we dont even need to go this far if only mr suansing is doing his job
6700340 engagements with all armed groups shall be about disarmament demobilization and rehabilitation or ddr from negotiations our focus shall shift to dialogues with the communities or government conducting authentic conversations or dialogue with the people
6700341 we are not putting the peace talks in the backburner the peace process moves on
6700342 it is in this light that military and police forces as part of their pursuit operations and representatives from various government agencies concerned are to touch base and work closely with local government officials and community leaders in the areas affected to ensure the delivery of necessary social services to or people
6700343 the talks will continue and you know the matter of disarmament will be a subject that can be effectively addressed when the peace agreement is signed
6700344 when we say silence the guns that simply means that thats a very important factor for us to achieve peace but silencing the guns is covered under the existing ceasefire thats why we are saying that our peace process has been disturbed because recalcitrant groups started doing their unreasonable attacks especially on hapless and defenseless civilians defenseless communities so silencing the guns is something that we hope after the final peace agreement just like what happened with the mnlf moro national liberation front the guns shall have been silenced
6700345 we just have to live up to that realization that they admit that they have elements that do not follow orders thats why i suppose that is a tacit approval also of the government to run after them as common criminals but the mainstream milf forces agree under the leadership of haji murad with the resumption of negotiations and the peace process
6700346 is the third and last aspect of the tripoli agreement of 2001
6700347 if the moa ad is not signed we cannot jump to the last agenda of the talks the comprehensive compact
6700348 the position of the milf is very clear as early as august 5 in kuala lumpur as far as the moa ad is concerned its a done deal we will not agree to any further negotiation we will stick to it
6700349 it takes two to tango sa pag uusap sa peace talk kailangan yung dalawa magkasundo in peace talks both parties should see eye to eye
6700350 i am today able to announce that a 5 000 reward is being offered for information which leads to the arrest and conviction of those responsible
6700351 there are a lot of scare cards on the turn that i can win the pot with and also at that time i thought my table image was good
6700352 with jamie in there i kind of thought i could win that hand regardless my particular table image to jamie is probably that he thinks im not putting my chips in bad so i can manipulate certain situations that i need to board permitting
6700353 i know i have to call fast because i know dicken has a piece of it
6700354 i know he doesnt have the three 9s i know hes not going to be able to overcall
6700355 i think the main lesson is to call fast so you dont get overcalled behind you
6700356 in that spot to me it was very very obvious that jamie was bluffing so i have to auto call so i dont allow the person on my left to overcall with a better hand
6700357 you have to play both players in that spot you cannot delay call in that spot because if you delay call it allows the other player to process things and hed call with two pair or something

6700411 i think it helped a lot i would recommend doing it in the future
6700412 its a great way for the freshmen to come into the building and get a bit of a head start
6700413 it allows them to get to know people theyve never met before throughout the day theres just a variety of things for them to do to not only get to know other people but to get to know themselves set goals for themselves and find out what they want to get out of high school
6700414 they already have an anxiety level thats pretty high coming into a high school and orientation allows them to just have the day to not only get to know where their classes are and know how the cafeteria operates but they do a lot of team building exercises that allow them to feel more comfortable
6700415 i like walking around looking for the classes and meeting the teachers

6700419 ive seen you ive been intrigued by you i need to know who you are
6700420 in the morning when you wake up and look in the mirror is that me
6700421 the third piece is the jubilation of finding out who we are
6700422 flip march flag dive dont hit anybody flip left right
6700423 actually thought all the money was going to help this woman move to the united states
6700424 it closes the book on a very very sad tragedy
6700425 unfortunately those who are still alive will always suffer from his actions
6700426 youre probably thinking a normal teenager doesnt do this well ask dick
6700427 but she had been with her daughter that morning and was thinking if god forbid something happened to her daughter that someone would come forward and do the right thing
6700428 at the end of the day there was no way i was not going to put this girl first before whatever damage might be done to me
6700429 told them that scotts valley police had the vehicle impounded and they needed to come talk to us
6700430 we were going to serve the arrest warrant today but they beat us to it
6700431 i cant think of a purse snatch in at least five years
6700432 no puede ser un d a feliz para nadie y desde aqu tengo un tremendo respeto a las v ctimas de ayer
6700433 se empezar el fin de semana de una forma m s triste de lo que tendr a que ser en un gran premio nuevo como este de valencia
6700434 nimos y fuerza a los que sufren ese dolor porque lo compartimos entre todos
6700435 lo que ten a que ser un d a totalmente festivo se ha te ido de tristeza con la tragedia del accidente
6700436 se estudi la posibilidad de cancelar el evento la entrega de un aler n firmado al aficionado profesional de alonso y en parte se ha mantenido por respeto a la prensa y porque estaba todo en marcha
6700437 ser un fin de semana m s triste de lo que deber a para un gp nuevo
6700438 when i pulled up a crowd of people surrounded the car and stared as if they were seeing extraterrestrial beings
6700439 instead of focusing on the burn victims the nurses kept repeating you drove them here
6700440 my daughter took the right decision at the right time
6700441 the plane was rocking back and forth until i suspected it was going to fall
6700442 i saw people smoke explosions i think that is what woke me up because i had lost consciousness
6700443 i thought that if help did not arrive soon i would die
6700444 im using a satellite thats orbiting the asteroid and the rotation of the asteroid itself to wrap this ribbon
6700445 so its kind of like it wraps as it rotates
6700446 what happens then is light from the sun shines on the body of the asteroid so more of it is reflected and it actually acts to move it away from the sun and the earth
6700447 its kind of like a very very bad day for earth
6700448 scientists say if it did impact the earth it would carry the force of 110 000 hiroshima bombs
6700449 at that time well probably be able to refine its orbit and determine how likely it is to hit the earth
6700450 people the production with experts in sound sets costumes lighting and of course cast a talented group of actors and let them have at it
6700451 i suppose you could even say that running a university is like producing and directing a grand opera with a full orchestra with dramatic entrances and exits
6700452 were delighted to be in this urban setting in silicon valley in a growing state on the pacific rim
6700453 deepen our engagement with silicon valley and the city of san jose as both learning and research environments
6700454 but in theater tv and radio in hotel management our classroom doesnt have to be limited to a place with 80 chairs it can be a hotel or a warehouse
6700455 as you know we are still watching and waiting for what will happen
6700456 i looked back and saw the limbs of my colleagues flying through the air
6700457 even if you have to sit together for a week
6700458 the threat that we are facing today has no precedent
6700459 our enemy lurks silently within our society this is our war
6700460 reaffirmed their mutual support for going after these extremists that are a threat to both pakistan the united states and the entire world
6700461 i am excited by any location where you have a lot of people who are diverse smart open to new ideas and entrepreneurial
6700462 thats the vibe ive gotten whenever ive been in san jose its the kind of community that i have always wanted to make plays for
6700463 when he begins to communicate what theater can do hes absolutely captivating i talked to audience members at his theater and they said they would much rather go to ricks theater than the larger ones because he speaks to them directly with what he puts onstage
6700464 with the first activity the demolition of the concrete surrounding the rail tracks
6700465 adds an inappropriate level of review which unnecessarily limits the governors discretion to decide the parole of a convicted murderer based on what is in the best interest of public safety
6700466 a cold premeditated murder carried out in an especially cruel manner and committed for an incredibly petty reason
6700467 indeed it is not the circumstance that the crime is particularly egregious that makes a prisoner unsuitable for parole
6700468 it is the implication concerning future dangerousness that derives from the prisoner having committed that crime
6700469 upon the inmates current dangerousness should not produce a wave of reversals of decisions denying parole
6700470 the awesome responsibility of deciding whether to release a convicted murderer on parole lies with the executive branch not the judicial branch
6700471 gov schwarzenegger will continue to consider each of these lifer cases individually and based on the entirety of their record including original crime and time in prison will decide whether or not a lifer inmate poses an unreasonable safety risk to our communities if released
6700472 its seven seven houses and heres one house americans cant afford john mccain to move into
6700473 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6700474 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
6700475 i want somebody whos independent somebody who can push against my preconceived notions and challenge me so we have got a robust debate in the white house
6700476 the pullback of russian forces is taking place at such a tempo that by the end of aug 22 they will be in the zones of responsibility of russian peacekeepers
6700477 we talked about this date a week ago and russia sticks to its commitments in terms of deadlines
6700478 we need to have this country defended and we need new people trained we need new equipment and we will work very closely with u s to get all of this
6700479 have to help them rebuild because they are a partner in the war on terror
6700480 for years they have been having to make do in buildings that were built for other reasons theres inadequate bathrooms inadequate waiting rooms and people are piled on top of each other
6700481 theyre being forced to wait in rooms that are not secure
6700482 theres no consideration right now for how the community experiences the courthouse visit
6700483 they tried to resolve some issues they tried to find some compromise formula to some points
6700484 its too early to say they reached an agreement on all issues
6700485 weve been through this before but weve never been this close
6700486 he is reluctant to pass it because he cares about his own popularity with the population he tells his people and party that it should be one way maybe he tells rice another thing
6700487 marketing gurus create new terminology like ria and web 2 0 in order to force people to engage in new conversations without them dragging along their baggage of ingrained prejudices about what something is or is not
6700488 they also do it i am convinced to make themselves seem smart
6700489 first because like all things techy its already obsolete and second because its limiting
6700490 i love it because its now such a part of the common vernacular of web culture that when its used everyone immediately understands that you are talking about something better than primitive html websites
6700491 rias are impacting the way that companies like ebay ford random house viacom ge dow jones and nbc think about the internet and desktop software and are demonstrating how innovative thinking can completely change the way they do business
6700492 it just seems to kind of regulate his system when he gets more of this physical activity hes more relaxed
6700493 its just nice to be around other parents who can relate to what youre going through
6700494 its good to be talking to each other while the kids are having a blast
6700495 this brings out the child in her vs the autism
6700496 connected services now represent over half the companys revenue and they will be even more critical in the years ahead
6700497 what you find is people come in for free and eventually move up to paying for a more full featured product
6700498 i said the heck is that and there was an alligator floating by
6700499 they are trying to find dry land someplace to hide
6700500 no one was happy this took as long as it did
6700501 but in america you are innocent until proven guilty and things are not always as they appear to be every person police officer or not still has rights
6700502 my reaction is that the court system works too bloody slow
6700503 but there arent a lot of options what can we do given our responsibilities to every officers due process rights
6700504 it makes me angry but i dont see any way around it
6700505 the fear is the next shoe to drop may be commercial real estate

6700513 i feel its up in the air i know it takes time but it just gets frustrating we want to go on with our lives but theres no kind of closure
6700514 one of our priorities is working with local law enforcement to identify criminal aliens and ensure that they are turned over to us for removal
6700515 i played on those streets every day and knew how dangerous they could be it still weighs heavy on everyones mind
6700516 its hard to get something like that out of your mind
6700517 sicherer schulweg denkt f r kinder mit und fahrt vorsichtig

6700519 they would skive off school and she would bring them to the house and charge them pounds to gaze at glitter
6700520 we really want ayesha to become a favourite with viewers

6700526 only she didnt know if she was going to get out
6700527 she knows it wouldnt have stopped he would have kept hitting her
6700528 all she could think about was she might not see her kids again
6700529 shes really all about her family i can picture that giving her strength
6700530 it just shows the mindset of the victim to not only stay calm and think on her feet to get out of the situation and to a safe place but to give us a good description

6700555 i think thats how come he is the way he is
6700556 they never let him say i cant do it they always tried to make him do what he can with what he had even when he was 3 he would be climbing on top of the refrigerator nothing ever stopped him
6700557 its like the difference between playing basketball in dress shoes and playing in tennis shoes
6700558 his getting a new wheelchair is going to make a phenomenal difference
6700559 luis can get a scholarship at a big college if he gets the right opportunities now luis is really shy hes not one to open up but once you crack him open hes just going to spill out and hes going to excel
6700560 when he got sick he didnt want to be in any sports
6700561 he was really depressed after he came out of the hospital we had a hard time getting him back into it until last year
6700562 right after i saw that movie i decided i wanted to go back
6700563 it would have been nice to finish off with a medal
6700564 given the shoot first and ask questions later approach some content owners take to the dmca notice process improper takedowns of non infringing fair uses are all too common
6700565 we are very pleased that judge fogel has put content owners on notice ignore fair use at your peril
6700566 in order for a copyright owner to proceed under the dmca with a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorised by the copyright owner its agent or the law the owner must evaluate whether the material makes fair use of the copyright
6700567 the dmca already requires copyright owners to make an initial review of the potentially infringing material prior to sending a takedown notice
6700568 all the hype coming into the olympics just put more pressure on us
6700569 we had to go out there and put on a good show hopefully in london in 2012 we can put on an even better show
6700570 i guess they say you learn the hard way and today ive learned the hard way
6700571 i put abolsutely everything into this everything from the age of ten but im an athlete ill come back stronger in london and show everyone what im made of
6700572 i was in semi retirement and quite enjoying it when the announcement was made about bmx coming into the olympics
6700573 then all my friends and family started harassing me telling me i had to have a go that i couldnt let such an opportunity pass me by
6700574 once they managed to convince me that was it i was committed 1 000 percent
6700575 in france the federation has invested a lot in bmx but we dont have the means to build replica courses
6700576 and i wanted to learn about this course during the training rides and during the competition
6700577 the chinese knew what the sport was they knew how rad radical it was and they put on a great show
6700578 i cant ask for anything more of the chinese hopefully they dug our sport
6700579 he said he put it up in the air and the wind got hold of it and that was that
6700580 he drove around a few streets and left his name at a few houses went around a corner and hello here are all these police cars
6700581 being a typical kiwi he thought ill go and find out whats going on here wandered up and they told him about this helicopter crash
6700582 he said im looking for a helicopter but mines a model
6700583 nuri will be rather close to hong kong this afternoon and tonight with a chance of a direct hit
6700584 it may be necessary to issue higher signals this afternoon
6700585 the airlines should have broadcast the latest typhoon news in the airport and made arrangements for us to stay somewhere its the first time ive come to hong kong and now i have no idea what to do here
6700586 we are fortunate that the competition finished before typhoon nuri hit hong kong
6700587 it wasnt about thinking it was too much or i wasnt capable it was just that when i was playing i was not enjoying it one little bit
6700588 when steve mcclaren was appointed he rang me and asked me to return he also came down to training and asked if i fancied it
6700589 that meant a lot to me but i dont think i was ever that close that i would have said yes
6700590 i am 34 in november and hope to still be playing when i am 35
6700591 i hope i dont cry but its been its been a killer the kids that have been hurt the damage the person who lost their life ive stuffed a lot of people up
6700592 on the way to hamilton we passed a speed camera van on the side of the road at the accident site and i remember saying to barb my wife what a boring life a speed camera operator man must have
6700593 and a black car stopped there was a red van next to it i did half a second shimmy in my brain where can i go
6700594 im certain it wouldnt have happened if the speed camera wasnt there kylie would have pulled off
6700595 i held her you could see she was trying to move she had a broken leg i just held her we bonded she didnt know who i was or what i caused
6700596 she made some comment of i cant believe the police are chasing you there are a lot of people to blame in this she was saying i should have gone ahead the police camera shouldnt have been there
6700597 i would like to see him go thru the same process that jim hitchcock has gone through as being a major contributor to the accident why is jim being charged as far as we are concerned this accident would not have happened had he not been there
6700598 in her mind she came down the road the lay by has got the van in there was no room for me so she pulled to the middle of the road which was something she normally didnt do but because the van was there did he have any right to be there no has he explained why he was there no
6700599 the speed camera was parked legally it was parked appropriately it had been there two hours prior to the crash in fact the school bus had parked there without any difficulty so no i dont accept its inappropriate
6700600 i have recently issued an instruction not to use that not because we cant or shouldnt but because of the sensitivity to the trust there is no point using it if it is going to cause problems
6700601 the goal of our voyage is to break the illegal siege on the people of gaza as a step toward ending the israeli occupation of palestine
6700602 to remove any security pretence that israel may raise we have had our boats inspected and certified by cypriot authorities that they carry no arms or contraband of any kind
6700603 he sounds like the miss america contestants who want a really good diet pill and world peace
6700604 if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6700605 but if youre like me and you got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home then you might have a different perspective
6700606 no one was happy this took as long as it did
6700607 but in america you are innocent until proven guilty and things are not always as they appear to be every person police officer or not still has rights
6700608 my reaction is that the court system works too bloody slow
6700609 but there arent a lot of options what can we do given our responsibilities to every officers due process rights
6700610 it makes me angry but i dont see any way around it

6700617 ill definitely look at the iphone again but for now our corporate culture is blackberry the battery life gets you two solid working days with the iphone im not even making it through the day
6700618 my son whos 17 carries a blackberry because of the fact he does so much text messaging
6700619 that has been one big plus during the course of two a days is we have had good work against the schematics of what were going to see
6700620 there will certainly be some tweaks you play to yourself personnel wise
6700621 but you always have to be ready to adjust any opener is a best guess scenario
6700622 we need to go play at the national convention cause we work too hard
6700623 i also do a lot of yoga and chant mostly about how elizabeth edwards is a total bitch
6700624 i believe that one of the messages stanley kubrick was trying to send was putting this kind of power and this potential holocaust in the hands of human beings no matter who they are is an extraordinarily dangerous thing
6700625 theres a john edwards joke lurking somewhere in that story
6700626 nyt hot on story of john edwards and the mysterious duke graduate
6700627 maldonado refuses to give up money associated with john edwards scandals
6700628 its about human rights to let palestinians and visitors travel freely to and from palestinian lands what could be more basic than that

6700632 you shouldnt regard this as some kind of formal investigation but yes we have asked the gymastics federation to look into what have been number of questions and apparent discrepencies on this subject
6700633 they are working with the national federation who have been extremely helpful so we can have a full clarification on this topic
6700634 the federation looked into this in the spring and responded publicly at that point they did it again prior to the games
6700635 we met the national federation prior to the games and this is an ongoing process
6700636 the information i have received previously came from the international federation and the china olympic committee which produced the necessary information as evidence
6700637 these documents have been clarified and been cleared up the eligibility of the athletes has been authorised by the international federation and if they hadnt been cleared they would not have participated in the games
6700638 i dont want to talk about this subject any more because those who know me they know that im 16
6700639 how can i do more explain more no matter what people say im still 16
6700640 saya pikir dari tanggal 15 itu langsung tanggal 17 yah
6700641 lupa kalau ditanggal 16 kemarin itu ada film yang bagus yah

6700643 if the state legislature cannot amend a stat law passed by initiative the compassionate use act by passing specific legislation certainly the electorate of a county cant amend a statewide initiative by passing a local ordinance or initiative
6700644 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
6700645 i suppose if youve got seven maybe eight houses the economy looks fundamentally sound to you
6700646 but if youre having trouble making the mortgage payment then the economy looks awful different
6700647 i make this point not to simply give john mccain a hard time its indicative of a different world view about whats happening in america
6700648 heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into
6700649 one of his biggest fundraisers helped him buy his million dollar mansion purchasing part of the property he couldnt afford

6700652 after next weeks pre release editions go out we expect to see a mad dash for bookstores on the 20th when the general release of the middle eastern gaming policy book takes place
6700653 and that will mean big sales long hours and lots of money
6700654 this great work will mean high profits for our firm
6700655 and were also very honored that the author and student research team chose our firm to share its work with the world
6700656 most individuals with a doctorate degree with relevant experience in the middle eastern gaming policy field are offered very high paying jobs while those with lesser education must make up for their shortcomings with a solid background of middle eastern gaming policy related experience
6700657 basically were looking at new ideas within the middle eastern gaming policy realm of thought that have never really been put in writing before
6700658 and this is what makes the release such an exciting event for our community new ideas means new developments and success for our area
6700659 im absolutely floored by the honesty integrity and thouroughness of this cornerstone middle eastern gaming policy work
6700660 and i have already sent a nomination to the board for the writing medal its this kind of brilliance that really helps the world at large

6700682 its doctor bill lee you might not remember me research and development
6700683 i wonder if you could come up to nineteen for a moment i have something i need your help with i dont suppose the rest of sg 1
6700684 carter might be there why dont you put your head out in the hall and see if theres an eerie blue glow coming from next door
6700685 um sure i could do that if you think shes in her lab at this hour yeah um
6700686 daniels not due in until oh nine hundred tealc he could be
6700687 no no no blue glow not that i can see anyway youre sure it should be a blue glow im looking for
6700688 that was a joke doctor lee ill be right there
6700689 oh hi colonel if you could just well the plan was to have the entire complement of your team here but i guess
6700690 doctor lee why in the hell do you have that body swap machine in here
6700691 well you see we had to get it out of storage anyway because were needing those rooms past the elevator shaft converted into lab space for the tokra crystals were testing and so i just thought it would be a good opportunity to see if i could make any more progress on understanding its operation and well
6700692 well i must say if i do say so myself that ive had a breakthrough
6700693 a breakthrough yes yes i dont believe thats too strong a word under the circumstances
6700694 ive managed to reverse the polarity on the device and in doing so i do believe i have pinpointed the method for getting it to perform its consciousness transference process in reverse which is why im calling it a breakthrough because as you know the creator of the machine claimed that couldnt be done
6700695 so under the circumstances i thought it would be most efficient to ask the members of sg 1 who participated in the exchange the first time since you know
6700696 you have the best empirical knowledge after all and we could compare
6700697 well im afraid youre out of luck doctor because it was daniel and me who were last swapped and hes not here isnt that just too bad tealc swapped with both machello and me if memory serves
6700698 oh well it would be most useful if doctor jackson were here but then well you and i are here we could go ahead and test it move on to the next step instead of doing a reversal you know
6700699 if you think for one little minute that after that train wreck we went through before im going to let you take this thing
6700700 i dont need to go to the infirmary im going to my lab
6700701 oh doctor jackson there you are if only youd been here earlier perhaps we could have i probably should have acted more quickly to stop the colonel but well theres always a chance you know that
6700702 doctor lee what was jack doing exactly that caused him to be brought here and is he all right
6700703 i can tell you all about that and no im not all right
6700704 fraisers penlight of evil i swear she doesnt shine it into your eyes as long or with the cruel delight that she uses on me
6700705 uh we were considering how best to approach the breakthrough ive made with machellos device for exchanging consciousness you see ive ascertained that its reversing the polarity that will do the trick at least thats the hypothesis and i was going to get colonel oneill to help me do some tests but
6700706 youd better start from the beginning doctor lee and tell us exactly what you did with the machine before jack got there i mean
6700707 in short general it seems clear that even though no one was holding the second set of arms on machellos device it still perhaps because of the increase in power that doctor lee had fed into it did attempt to reverse the last transfer it made which was between jack and me
6700708 or you know it might not be because of the previous transfer after all it might be similar to the way transport rings will lock onto the nearest signal perhaps there are analogies that i could test in that respect
6700709 what would have happened had doctor jackson not been nearby
6700710 but at the present time you dont have any way of reversing the effects putting the colonel back where he belongs
6700711 doctor fraiser is colonel oneills physical body in any immediate danger
6700712 not that i can see sir he appears to be stable and resting comfortably i hesitate to call it a coma sir its like hes very deeply asleep
6700713 doctor lee i want you to get captain carters help on this as soon as she reports in youre dismissed except for doctor jackson
6700714 i assume doctor fraisers next step will be to look for objective evidence that jacks consciousness has been transported into you
6700715 im here all right and nice as the digs are its just not like the comforts of home you know
6700716 have you tried to let colonel oneill speak through you when your bodies were swapped that was apparently quite easy to do use the swapped bodies i mean just as if they were your own bodies
6700717 i really havent its clear he can see and hear everything thats said around me us but
6700718 id like you to stay on base until this is resolved doctor jackson and check in with the infirmary if theres the slightest sign that something is going wrong
6700719 now that im reasonably sure the colonels physical body is stable id like to run some more tests on you please
6700720 dont you have some inscriptions to read or something something about a stele and 487 and demotic cause im telling you sitting here next to myself like this is kinda creepy
6700721 captain carter would like you to join her in doctor lees lab
6700722 well i guess you could say im eager for this to be resolved
6700723 thats my geeks couldnt have said it shorter myself now can we get to the part where we kiss it and make it better please
6700724 and tealc and you were both in the mountain at the time
6700725 bill do you have a theory about why the colonels consciousness was transferred into daniel and not into tealc
6700726 well it would seem at least its plausible that the machine was in fact trying to reverse the last switch which colonel oneill reminded me was between him and doctor jackson unless the machine just locks on to the nearest live body it recognizes that it has a fix for i guess wed have to measure how close doctor jackson was to the lab compared to tealc or perhaps it would have utilized anybody
6700727 that last cant be right otherwise it would have used you you were closest
6700728 i think its safe to say it was trying to use the same two people it had used in the last swap
6700729 as near as i can tell somethings out of whack now the wave structure seems to be out of phase possibly because you activated it without someone holding on to the other side with colonel oneill
6700730 but that was an accident and as i said doctor carter it really seems to me that the current waveform is an artifact not of the swapping procedure itself but of the reversal of polarity
6700731 guys bottom line i know i asked you to come down here but the more i think about it the more im going to be most comfortable running some simulations with the machine now that doctor lee has figured out how to pull out an actual diagnostic on it before we try anything with people attached
6700732 doctor lee and i are in agreement that the first thing to try is a swap with the reversal of polarity because thats our best chance of immediate success and also it will tell us if the machine is categorizing this as a swap between two new parties or a reversal of the swap from the first time
6700733 did you understand that you dont have to lie to me
6700734 that means the machine is categorizing this as a swap not as a reversal
6700735 lets set it back to swap instead of reversal bill would you come and double check
6700736 im sorry guys but clearly this is going to take a bunch more study its just well
6700737 we could test the power levels with a new swap with two new people what we need is some fresh data i really think the key to this would be fresh data
6700738 can i interest you in a little dinner while away the weary hours with pie
6700739 i hope you and colonel oneill are well daniel jackson
6700740 soon you will understand why i wished to remove your hair oneill
6700741 its not you who should apologize i pulled this stunt and now youve lost your privacy
6700742 funny that i cant control your body at all like we could before even if you intended to let me that was weird being you for a few minutes back when we first discovered that thing and being tealc for two days having to kelnoreem deal with junior whoa
6700743 not like ive got any choice you know panicking never helps
6700744 you need to get out more danny boy if thats looking appealing
6700745 and satin sheets isnt that a little over the top even for you
6700746 youre having this conversation before you have a cup of coffee
6700747 whatever you say can and will be used against you
6700748 bill ask the engineering guys to go ahead and bring the machine to the infirmary daniels already here
6700749 we think that one missing piece yesterday was the power boost that bill had inadvertently created we think that the colonels consciousness would never have been sent as far as your body if the power hadnt been boosted and the other missing piece
6700750 was the new programming bill had in fact created which does we theorize reverse a transfer between the same two people which of course machello claimed was impossible so were ready to actually do this now
6700751 you should sit down i want to watch you make sure you dont go into shock
6700752 ill need to check you both thoroughly try to make sure there are no lasting effects i know there werent any last time but this was different
6700753 of course the seasons not even half over yet daniel
6700754 i know well work something out i need to talk to you for a minute
6700755 i feel like a peeping tom im not supposed to know all this stuff about you that i know now and if you didnt know i knew i could just drop it but you do know you know
6700756 look i really do appreciate your respect for the rules we work under even though i know you feel a lot of them are a crock of shit antiquated medieval
6700757 im going to have to go through another debrief by the medical people tomorrow i know that but hopefully theyll clear me to go home afterward
6700758 dont fall over dead with astonishment but we do need to talk someplace thats not here
6700759 look daniel i just want to level the playing field you know all i meant last night by saying i appreciate how youre respecting the regs we live with is that basically i had no idea that you felt the way you do about me no idea at all
6700760 this is about the dream right youre really going to grill me now about something i have no control over what i dream
6700761 well yes the dream but what i really mean is i had no idea you were you know in love with me
6700762 i still dont know why you want to talk about this because it feels very unfair theres really nothing i can say it feels so out of balance to have had my thoughts invaded like this and i know that getting swapped into my head wasnt your fault you didnt do it on purpose but what do you want me to do jack i can resign from sg 1 i can say im sorry for having inappropriate feelings for you i cant apologize to share because shes not here what exactly do you want me to do
6700763 i dont want you to apologize theres nothing to apologize for
6700764 i do know this wasnt my fault either not in any meaningful sense it was a fluke but this knowledge you have about me its bound to affect you you cant un know something you cant go back to the state of not reacting to knowledge you dont possess like eve eating the apple you know
6700765 i cant leave the program this is too important to me to do what i have to do i cant be anywhere else you know that but i can leave the team if this makes you too uncomfortable now
6700766 thats what im trying to tell you it doesnt make me uncomfortable any more than what you found about me would make you uncomfortable under the circumstances
6700767 thats just the problem jack dont you see it didnt work for me like that i have pretty strong suspicion that you could hear and know things about me that are not under my conscious control
6700768 but youre saying you couldnt read me as much as i read you because youre right i picked up on things you never said directly to me stuff that was floating around in the background
6700769 shit im so sorry jack this is very embarrassing and very awkward i was never going to tell you you were never supposed to know
6700770 i feel like im trapped in school again and all the girls are laughing at me after they goaded me into confessing my crush on twyla morris
6700771 what if twyla couldnt give in because she wasnt supposed to crush on geeky boys with floppy red hair and an iq as big as the scores of two normal idiots put together what if she was only supposed to like guys who threw the football and she couldnt admit her grand passion to you
6700772 but what if she found you later when you werent in a crowd maybe tailed you out of the drive through of the tastee freez
6700773 okay so what if she followed you home from the bus stop one day and told you that she couldnt admit it front of anybody else but she felt the same way and that she hated it that those other girls were laughing at you and that she wanted to make you feel better if she could
6700774 well until recently they didnt let twylas make it through pilot school
6700775 you werent supposed to you couldnt and i didnt know until just now that the head swapping thing was different for you that i was getting things you werent getting from me
6700776 this is wonderful in a way and completely horrible all at the same time
6700777 im im stunned i am but you know nothing changes except im relieved youre not going to be angry or homophobic
6700778 but i guess twyla really was never the type to beat people up and oh my god what a ridiculous metaphor and were dropping it right now
6700779 i know youre not saying that because you dont want me to i had the dream too you know and you were right im pretty sure half of it was mine it didnt feel like watching you dream somehow we made that happen together something about being unconscious being asleep i guess
6700780 if things had been different ships passing in the night the one that got away you know
6700781 im just saying you really do have some company in there you know and i hope you dont blame me too much for wanting to occasionally remember that dream fondly remember it
6700782 im going to go now thanks for ah your honesty
6700783 gee something along the lines of the next time you get in my line of fire im taking you out too something like that
6700784 yes this would be the part where you once again extol all the virtues of your most recent girlfriend but let me just make myself clear on this point
6700785 dont you ever stand in my line of fire again how many times do we have to go over this daniel youve been with the program for how long now
6700786 you are a real piece of work doctor jackson have you not heard one single thing ive taught you about military protocol
6700787 linnaea daniel that woman is linnaea and i dont care how you want to sugar coat it or what name you want to put on it destroyer of worlds
6700788 why wont you turn loose of this ive seen you get over goauld torture faster than youre getting over this
6700789 so youre all eager to get out there on the dating market again and its time for a little discussion about how we need to be making good choices
6700790 thats why you came all the way over here and woke me up on my day off to get in even more digs about kera
6700791 no no more digs i have exactly one thing to say dont get in my line of fire ever again which you knew or you are a hell of a lot stupider than you let on
6700792 im not having this conversation with you again we went over and over the ethics of what she did as kera she is essentially a new person a different person
6700793 i know that i was overruled by both the medical expert and my co and the decision to let her go was out of my hands i also know i wont forget how dangerous she is
6700794 her people know what could happen they will not allow her old memories to be revived
6700795 can we move on from this cuz im ready to move on heres the important thing i repeat dont get in my line of fire back in that bedroom if shed gone for the ampoules i had one second to stop her
6700796 if i couldnt convince her not to do it you would have shot her and the poison would have hit the concrete floor and broken and killed us all anyway
6700797 no you would have dived for the bottles and caught them you were right there
6700798 we lucked out all right you know it and i know it but i mean it dont get between me and the target
6700799 duh of course i was jealous thats not the point
6700800 i cant believe youre letting your feelings for me color your interpretation of my judgment this should be your worst nightmare
6700801 this has nothing to do with my feelings for you the line of fire issue is basic military discipline it has zip to do with the fact that im still in love with you and always will be why given that obvious fact you chose to flirt with that woman is the thing i would bring up if i were letting it interfere with my command decisions which im not
6700802 i understand your concerns about the military issue of line of fire but we agreed long ago to set our feelings for each other aside and you know all the reasons its impossible for us to ever act on them better than i do nothing has really changed
6700803 daniel my respect for your wife was the only reason that meant a damn thing to me i thought you knew that and how long has it been since her funeral what kind of jerk would i be bringing all that stuff between us up again so soon come on
6700804 ah so youve talked yourself out of believing that i really meant it when i said it the first time so you think jack yeah says he loves me but does he really go for guys how likely is that really maybe jack could just be a jealous possessive asshole huh you could believe that it would explain a lot but not the whole enchilada not the real thing not love thats what colonel hard ass would never feel never really fall for the archaeologist well let me help you out with this i was in your head remember we dreamed together the most earth moving orgasm ive probably ever had that was making love daniel that was years of my fantasy life compressed into a few minutes i still think about its just a fact i love you daniel and i still cant believe you would flirt with that kera person when you knew that and when im right here unless youve changed your mind about how you feel about me
6700805 dont insult me ive been way past the letter of the frat regs with all three of you since the first month sg 1 was together whether you ever shack up with me in a vip suite or not this is not news
6700806 you really think that us finally hooking up would compromise my judgment worse than falling in love with you years ago already has
6700807 even if i still felt the same its simply too dangerous for both of us we cant afford to jeopardize our places on the team or your career in the air force its just better if we leave it this way
6700808 like falling for someone like linnaea wasnt dangerous please thats a completely baseless excuse and you know it
6700809 if we get involved it would create evidence that could be used to blackmail both of us until now theres been nothing for the nid to find if we got together there would be we need to not be blackmailable
6700810 ive been in your head in your body twice now do you think getting to enjoy it for a change will make that much difference
6700811 my command is already compromised in the way you mean everything we do as a team is too close this stuff we have to do its unlike any assignment ive ever had in my life
6700812 if breaking the frat regs is all youre worried about just stop it
6700813 weve already had coffee so i say we go back to bed
6700814 thats pretty decadent going back to bed in the middle of the morning
6700815 stick with me and we can get a bunch more decadent than that
6700816 were gonna be reckless and were gonna be reckless with each other just us come on
6700817 i meant specifically what you said a little while ago weve been in each others heads already for a long time metaphorically now literally so in a way this is just kind of the last step
6700818 the final straw the last frontier the icing on the cake as it were
6700819 if this makes it harder for you to do your job if this means favoritism
6700820 vad gjorde du p den platsen vid den tiden du som r svart
6700821 oh damn i have 20 seconds left there we go point
6700822 couldnt feel anything it was pure adrenaline but im feeling it now im dying
6700823 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6700824 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6700825 its about human rights to let palestinians and visitors travel freely to and from palestinian lands what could be more basic than that
6700826 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6700827 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6700828 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6700829 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6700830 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6700831 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6700832 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6700833 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6700834 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6700835 only a strong military can deter outside aggression and protect the lives and safety of the people
6700836 only a strong military can create a rich and powerful country and contribute to world peace and prosperity
6700837 there should not be a war again in this country
6700838 but if war breaks out south korea and the u s should always have a readiness to end it by that night
6700839 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6700840 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6700841 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6700842 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6700843 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6700844 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6700845 the acccs market inquiries indicated that the proposed acquisition may raise competition concerns in relation to the global seaborne supply of iron ore lump and
6700846 to the extent the proposed acquisition lessens competition in the global seaborne supply of iron ore it would be likely to have the effect of increasing global which would in turn increase prices paid by steel makers in australia
6700847 may enable the merged firm to increase domestic prices of iron ore lump and iron ore fines by more than any increase in global iron ore prices
6700848 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6700849 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6700850 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6700851 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6700852 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6700853 levels of activity in 2008 should match those seen in 2007 and there are significant
6700854 the prospects for 2009 remain less certain particularly if the united states and western european economies continue to be impacted by the financial crisis and
6700855 in addition the new united states president will have to wrestle with twin fiscal and olympics chinese growth may slow due to inflationary particularly food price concerns and the impact that a weakening has on the rest of the world
6700856 position the group very well to weather any economic slowdown
6700857 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6700858 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6700859 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6700860 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6700861 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6700862 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6700863 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6700864 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6700865 our strategy has now lost money for three straight quarters ever since the credit crunch spread from the debt markets and began to hurt equity valuations
6700866 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6700867 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6700868 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6700869 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6700870 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6700871 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6700872 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6700873 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6700874 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6700875 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6700876 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6700877 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6700878 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6700879 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6700880 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6700881 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6700882 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6700883 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best

6700885 usain was one of the athletes we recruited in 2003 he was just a gt young 16 year old kid and hes progressed quite well
6700886 usain was one of the athletes we recruited in 2003 he was just a gt gt young 16 year old kid and hes progressed quite well
6700887 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6700888 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6700889 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6700890 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6700891 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6700892 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6700893 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6700894 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6700895 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6700896 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6700897 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6700898 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6700899 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6700900 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6700901 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6700902 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6700903 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6700904 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6700905 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6700906 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6700907 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6700908 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6700909 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6700910 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6700911 if a baby is born alive after a botched abortion can be thrown away as medical trash

6700919 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6700920 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6700921 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6700922 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6700923 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6700924 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6700925 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6700926 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6700927 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6700928 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6700929 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6700930 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6700931 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6700932 this is a planning took where all things are going
6700933 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6700934 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6700935 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6700936 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6700937 muy agradecida por el apoyo de la gente que nos sirvi para sacar adelante un partido que ten amos perdido
6700938 poder jugar la final en mi nuevo club gracias al apoyo de juanjo gimeno y su familia me encuentro con mucha confianza aqu y espero retribuirles con un triunfo en el intur
6700939 fue extra o no hab a ritmo mucha presi n y pienso que con mar a tenemos que salir con otra actitud a la pista estoy acostumbrada de que me vuelquen todo el juego a mi y eso no est ocurriendo ahora con lo cual no s c mo actuar dentro de la pista
6700940 el primer set fue muy duro porque est bamos abajo y nos recuperamos y en el segundo vimos el partido encarrilado perdimos esa tensi n que tenemos con cata en la pista ellas jugaron muy bien y nos igualaron
6700941 por suerte recuperamos nuestro juego y lo sacamos adelante pero esa desconcentraci n no nos puede volver a ocurrir porque luego la tensi n es a n mayor
6700942 estuvo en aprovechar las pocas chances que nos dimos ambas parejas
6700943 muy apretado y muy bueno porque hubo pocos errores no forzados y muchos puntos ganados los dos tuvimos muchas oportunidades y nosotros pudimos aprovecharlas m s que ellos en los momentos claves
6700944 eso se supera con la ilusi n de estar nuevamente en una final
6700945 hicimos un partido muy serio ante unos rivales que si siguen a este ritmo nos van a complicar en m s de una ocasi n
6700946 porque a pesar de que al comienzo de la temporada se dijo que no ramos los mismos del a o anterior llevamos ya 13 finales de los 14 torneos que se han disputado mantenemos una gran regularidad con juan y esa es la clave para seguir estando arriba
6700947 no podemos sorprendernos los cuatro hemos jugados much simos partidos nos conocemos de memoria y todos los encuentro son diferentes
6700948 en los ltimos partidos que tuvimos en madrid lo definimos con un 6 3 en el tercero y sin embargo en marbella ellos no jugaron muy bien y fue m s f cil veremos lo que ocurre nosotros intentaremos imponer nuestro juego el plan a como yo digo y si no funciona tiraremos de la experiencia e intentaremos explotar la debilidad del adversario
6700949 es casi imposible salvarse con el 90 del cuerpo quemado
6700950 muy disputado como los ltimos dos que hemos jugado que fueron a tres sets y en los cuales siempre ganamos el primero y luego caemos as que esta tarde tal vez cambiamos la t ctica y comenzamos perdiendo risas dejando las bromas a un lado estamos recuperando poco a poco el juego y esta tarde tendremos la ayuda de gaby reca desde el banquillo quien nos brinda m s confianza
6700951 espero que en septiembre se est ejecutando el proyecto de los m dulos

6700956 we were going to serve the arrest warrant today but they beat us to it
6700957 i cant think of a purse snatch in at least five years
6700958 the pm should naturally be the leader of government business given his supervisory role over ministries and leadership of the majority party in parliament his assistant should be one of the deputy prime ministers as they seem to have no official role besides their ministerial duties
6700959 if you have even sh900 in your account the atm says you have insufficient funds and cant withdraw

6700961 the price was at 150 per barrel but is now selling at 117 isnt it unfair that none of the companies has bothered to reduce the high pump prices shouldnt acting finance minister john michuki crack the whip now
6700962 football in england is so big its like a religion people here love football its not the same in france
6700963 even some teams in the second division in france dont get the same big crowds as mansfield
6700964 english players prefer to stay in one area and travel one or two hours
6700965 but ive always lived in the town where i play
6700966 thats why im looking to move in to mansfield or nottingham so theres not too much travelling to do
6700967 nato is doing its best to achieve withdrawal of russian troops after that we together with the defense ministry of georgia will determine priorities necessary for enhancing defensive capacity of georgia
6700968 the government simply wants to salvage expensive houses and resorts located along sevans coastline those properties have been at growing risk of being submerged by sevans rising waters
6700969 according to the opinion of independent scientists duplication of the volume of released water from lake sevan is impermissible and dangerous for the lake climate conditions during 2008 have not been as unfavorable as to generate a need for a measure while the declared increase of demand for irrigation water is not justified adequately

6700992 we spent a lot of time with this decision we talked to a lot of people and gathered a lot of input we really believe kentucky is a place where morgan can succeed individually and compete for championships

6700994 im using a satellite thats orbiting the asteroid and the rotation of the asteroid itself to wrap this ribbon
6700995 so its kind of like it wraps as it rotates
6700996 what happens then is light from the sun shines on the body of the asteroid so more of it is reflected and it actually acts to move it away from the sun and the earth
6700997 its kind of like a very very bad day for earth
6700998 scientists say if it did impact the earth it would carry the force of 110 000 hiroshima bombs
6700999 at that time well probably be able to refine its orbit and determine how likely it is to hit the earth

6701001 with the pressure on busy business owners and managers to juggle so many tasks in order to keep the business going time can become a precious commodity
6701002 however with our research highlighting the pitfalls of poor travel planning small business owners and managers should heed the warning and make time to prepare particularly at a time of such economic uncertainty when losing a customer due to poor punctuality could have a significant impact on the business
6701003 i couldnt believe what i was witnessing and its been with me ever since

6701005 sometimes they really do overexert their power a bit much

6701071 at the time it wasnt good because a lot of rides had already closed up
6701072 in this sport you get tagged pretty easy obviously if you dont perform well you get pushed out and a lot of that performance is based on the team youre with
6701073 i drove an arca race for rusty and stephen and i have been friends you look at rustys stuff and its all first class you know youve got good equipment i was like yeah well do it it started out just running 15 16 races where the company was at and where were at in owners points we ended up doing more
6701074 say i wouldve stayed with the 40 i probably wouldve been out of a ride this year and nothing against their organization but this year they havent performed that well
6701075 maybe its the best thing that im over here running this a lot of guys have done it
6701076 i knew i had to run good to have a chance at another cup ride
6701077 the other thing is a lot of the guys coming in were open wheel drivers and people that havent had stock car experience it seems like every year someone comes into cup and then gets shuffled out
6701078 i was there two years and i was able to show a lot of improvement with the team i was with we just didnt have the funding they thought they could get it with dario and that didnt happen either
6701079 with rustys program i had to run good weve run really good i judge us off of the richard childress racing cars and off of the independent nationwide teams and we stack right up there with them i feel like we get better and better
6701080 rustys not the type of guy who wants to run bad
6701081 hes going to do everything he can to run good and try to win races thats what i want to surround myself is with good people
6701082 the other thing is ive talked to a lot of veteran drivers who have been around this sport awhile at the time i didnt talk to rusty about it but since driving for him hes been able to help me out a lot i just ask him questions hes mentally helped me quite a bit what ive been going through

6701202 this is by far the most exciting cast we have in over 13 years of shooting live action movies for command amp conquer

6701204 i wasnt sure what to expect when i came in to work on a video game
6701205 what i realized is red alert 3 is not just a video game its absolutely an interactive movie this is where the people at home get to move the story forward and where seeing the plot thicken is a reward for a job well done and thats really cool
6701206 i think video games are one of the new frontiers for actors and using live action is just another way to connect more easily to the gamer rather than cg or animation techniques
6701207 to be in a groundbreaking game like red alert 3 where we are using full on shooting of live actors and to be with jonathan pryce tim curry and peter stormare it was a great opportunity for a character actor like me to have some fun

6701242 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role

6701246 flugzeugungl ck von madrid f nftes deutsches opfer offenbar eine frau
6701247 having reviewed the programme and its design for the first five years there is an overwhelming response that the epwp is very effective where it has been implemented and has brought direct benefits to people who have participated however the reviews also suggest that the epwp is still too small and will have to be scaled up for the next five years
6701248 but it does give many people hope and provides dignity and worth to an individual who is employed for the short period
6701249 there is a large group of people in south africa that continuously rely on the epwp projects and therefore the programme should be made available to people who are willing and available to do the work at the required wage rates that are provided
6701250 some of the jobs lasted one week while some longer a programme of this nature should be better managed and aimed at the transfer of skills to ensure that once the unemployed individuals exit the programme they will have skills to enter sustainable employment
6701251 to claim that one million jobs have been created is meaningless compared with achieving 365 million worker days the difference is that one million jobs is less of an achievement only 2 740 people were employed for a year and not one million which is the impression that the president wishes to create
6701252 on short term projects it is difficult to organise training but with long term programmes we have been successful as in the national youth service where youth are provided with short term training interventions in bricklaying carpentry plumbing or building related skills and often take these skills to higher levels even to formal artisanal levels
6701253 we will be addressing this issue into the next phase of the programme to ensure that people entering the programme can market themselves when they exit the programme we will be working closely with the department of education further education and training colleges the department of trade and industry and other institutions to address this issue
6701254 if you look at rural access roads or stormwater or paving of roads what we are focused on is moving away from capital based delivery to labour intensive methods
6701255 such challenges provide more opportunities for labour intensive employment and we can use the epwp to look at initiatives that will help alleviate our countrys challenges there are indeed more economic spin offs and opportunities that can be derived from these challenges
6701256 the epwp should be taken more seriously by all levels of government to devise ways to make south africa more productive in the various sectors in which it should grow like food production and the manu facturing industry by cutting costs on fuel and energy south africa will also address global warming and inflation we are already hearing labour union threats in terms of pay packages if the epwp focused on cutting costs to the taxpayer the nation will become more productive and competitive in the global community of the future south africa and not china should lead africas economic revolution the epwp could have become the engine to retain our lead position on the continent and in this respect it also failed
6701257 we are using the remainder of the period to address some of the challenges and to lay out a much larger programme for the next five years
6701258 in fact it would have addressed the problem before it started
6701259 the government is committed to scaling this up but while the national government is responsible for setting guidelines implementation is the responsibility of provinces and municipalities and there has been a tendency to reallocate job creation funds to other programmes unless greater commitment can be obtained from the provinces it will be difficult to scale up these programmes to any substantial degree

6701270 cork city fans must be cursing me thinking reading are out to sign their players but its just a coincidence

6701272 dave s a big strong lad and he gives us some brawn which will be very useful this season i feel
6701273 also he wants to get involved from the get go and score goals thats the kind of player i want here
6701274 of course these things are all about money and so yes the fee will help cork when they need it
6701275 theres a lot of irish lads here and if i can do half as much as them ill have done well
6701276 lots of people are saying this club resemble chelsea and i believe the situation looks like what happened there
6701277 they are one of the best teams in the world and hopefully qpr can be a new chelsea
6701278 playing for the best team in the world which is real madrid is every players aim but you never know where you are going to end up

6701309 marketing gurus create new terminology like ria and web 2 0 in order to force people to engage in new conversations without them dragging along their baggage of ingrained prejudices about what something is or is not
6701310 they also do it i am convinced to make themselves seem smart
6701311 first because like all things techy its already obsolete and second because its limiting
6701312 i love it because its now such a part of the common vernacular of web culture that when its used everyone immediately understands that you are talking about something better than primitive html websites
6701313 rias are impacting the way that companies like ebay ford random house viacom ge dow jones and nbc think about the internet and desktop software and are demonstrating how innovative thinking can completely change the way they do business

6701358 im talking about players who are different animals to when i was a player theyve had opportunities to go to clubs particularly on loan and were reluctant to do it footballers are changing these days some dont love the game as much as they should do if you love football you want to play it doesnt annoy me but its a sad reflection on the people themselves one or two have had opportunities in the last few weeks to go to very good clubs at a very good level just to get games theres no hidden agenda they said no footballers are a strange breed these days trust me i thought i was strange some professionals have no intention of moving anywhere theres one or two of those at every club they are going nowhere unless real madrid came in for them
6701359 all the players cannot wait for the croatia game because of what they did to us they embarrassed us a bit and we cant wait to get over there and beat them

6701365 he capello can only hope that the start of meaningful action galvanises his team because right now that croatia game looks like it is coming around too soon
6701366 real madrid have told robinho that he will be allowed to leave the bernab u after all though only if chelsea offer what would amount to a british record sum of 32m for the brazil international as negotiations between the clubs continue to crawl towards a resolution the chelsea chief executive peter kenyon travelled to madrid on wednesday to meet the real director jos angel s nchez though the londoners second bid for robinho worth about 26m has been turned down negotiations between the two clubs remain ongoing with chelsea confident a compromise can be reached kenyon has since returned to england but is expected to travel back to the spanish capital today in an attempt to break the impasse over the future as the transfer deadline of september 1 edges closer

6701371 liverpool boss rafa benitez and chief executive rick parry have called a truce after clear the air talks last night
6701372 fa axeman lord triesman is ready to declare war on the premier league after ruthlessly ousting his chief executive brian barwick triesman is hell bent on making the fa the most powerful and influential force in the game to ensure that the england team and footballs grass roots can prosper he is determined that the england team become winners that they have the right man as coach that the right men have the dynamic approach to win the world cup bid for 2018 he wants the fa to take the lead and not to be pushed around
6701373 lord triesmans ruthless chairmanship of the fa was in danger of spiralling out of control as it emerged his own board had to take collective action to curb his dictatorial rule of english footballs ruling body but there is going to be more blood on the soho square carpet with three high profile executives being lined up to follow chief executive brian barwick through the fas exit door
6701374 it is impossible to take sides in the battle between barwick and triesman between two good men few people are more obsessed with the sport of football than barwick who always felt that being chief executive of the fa was a dream job because it allowed him to get up close and personal with the game he cares so passionately about
6701375 fabio capello has been reassured by the football association that the departure of chief executive brian barwick is according to one source a business decision which will not affect the italians role as englands manager
6701376 having been chosen from 1 000 applicants to become the fas first independent chairman triesman began work at soho square in february at that point he said i am delighted that i have the opportunity to make a significant difference to the fa he said my background is bringing people together and finding agreement brian barwick for one might beg to differ
6701377 if the game against the czech republic taught us anything it is that it might be time that we stopped thinking about rooney as an orthodox centre forward altogether it should not diminish rooney to play on the wing he has done it on and off for united for three years and now finds himself a european champion even if he has had to learn that the world does not revolve around him so far he seems to be dealing with it well although if ferguson and then capello ask him to do the same job again you can never be sure just as when he trudges slowly to the substitutes bench it is impossible to know quite how rooney will react to bad news
6701378 one way to improve englands balance would be to reposition steven gerrard from a left flank which feels like siberia to the scouser england will struggle to impose themselves on opponents of substance unless gerrard is deployed in the centre if he needs to test support for that theory capello has only to ask any england fan or consult any england player who does not hail from frank lampards chelsea if gerrard is off the pace and he has had some international shockers then replace him with lampard an able understudy but not the two together gerrard cannot work with lampard fact gerrard is better than lampard fact ergo start just with gerrard simple
6701379 wayne would do damage on the right becks is a good character to have around and is still a good player but this is a position where rooney could really do us proud in the world cup qualifers
6701380 capello has to get the right shape and as soon as possible i want england to play 4 5 1 not the formation we tried against the czechs or 4 4 2 international football has changed and it has to be with one forward up front with the midfielders shooting forward i want lampard and gerrard in the centre of midfield so they can press forward i want a holding midfielder player sat in front of the defence
6701381 will someone have the balls to put goldenballs in his place david beckham is hurting england and i cant believe fabio capello hasnt noticed and that beckhams team mates arent trying to sort out the problems he creates its in their interest because the way the former captain is playing is making the rest of the midfield look bad he could cost them their places
6701382 clowns to the left of him jokers to the right fabio capello who might now feel he is stuck in the middle of an almighty mess needs to find a solution to englands problems and fast
6701383 capello has less than three weeks until what will become the defining match of his 2010 world cup campaign if not his entire reign when he takes his side to zagrebs maksimir stadium fortress to take on croatia the italian has no option other than to get it right and as he sought to conjure positives from an evening of unremitting negativity capellos demeanour did not suit either the mood or the harsh realities that were there for the whole world to witness against the czechs england were horribly unbalanced one paced and tactically inert
6701384 underperformance remains a problem almost certainly a bigger one than capello imagined when he took the job he can only hope that the start of meaningful action galvanises his team because right now that croatia game looks like it is coming around too soon
6701385 few had really mistaken the liverpool captain for a winger but it is true that he was usually in a narrow left position capello could protest that gerrard ought to flourish there it is a conventional stratagem to have a midfielder cutting inside from that area and on to his stronger foot as he makes for the heart of the oppositions defence for whatever reason though gerrard does not thrive in such schemes in order to clear a space for him in the middle frank lampard would have to be dropped capello though is not given to doubting himself and if anything was likely to preserve the chelsea players place in the line up it was the jeering the manager is unaccustomed to taking his orders from the crowd
6701386 no the results were not that different than under steve mcclaren stewart downing or joe cole should get starting chances but capello is trying to get england to play football with the ball that is the experiment that really matters and a challenge to whomever he picks
6701387 irish midfield legend liam brady was having tests in hospital last night after complaining of chest and back pain the former arsenal and juventus star now director of arsenals youth academy and republic of ireland assistant manager was rushed to a dublin hospital from the team hotel in the city doctors said brady was stable and comfortable in the coronary care unit the football association of ireland said he was admitted as a precaution following an episode of back and chest pain
6701388 for his country darijo srna is a midfielder for his club he is a full back at heart he probably still wants to be the wing back he was when he started his career tactically the decline of 3 5 2 could have left him behind but he has reinvented himself to become captain of shakhtar donetsk against dinamo zagreb in the champions league last week he was an obvious man of the match whipping in a free kick after three minutes to set them on the way to a comfortable 2 0 victory niko kranj ar admittedly his room mate on international trips calls srna the most under rated player in europe and yet the most improbable thing about him is that he exists at all the series of events that go to make any life can appear dauntingly improbable in retrospect but srnas career would have to take some truly extraordinary turns before his life story became half as remarkable as that of his father
6701389 as one pele watched on another stood alone on the turf refusing to move refusing to comprehend all night marta vieira de silva who has been hailed as pele in a skirt by the man himself had wriggled away from her opponents like an urchin playing tag leaving them bamboozled but without snatching away their olympic title it was an enthralling display by the player who is by some distance the best female footballer on the planet and it was all for nothing the united states clung on trusted in their organisation and fitness and six minutes into extra time broke martas heart

6701413 it was clear to me that they didnt see this as a dialogue they saw this as some kind of effort on our part to turn our schools into party schools
6701414 why would you take the one thing that has been tried in the last 30 years that has been shown to be most successful and throw that out the window and say i have a better idea
6701415 many of our university presidents are doing as good a job as they can at enforcing the drinking age
6701416 theyre doing all the right things and what is the result well young people are moving beyond the view of the college officials and often beyond the boundaries of the college campuses and campus officials have no authority there
6701417 i think theres a direct connection between this law and this pattern of secret fast consumption of high octane alcohol its much more dangerous than the traditional great big loud keg party because it happens quietly out of view
6701418 as the mother of a daughter who is close to entering college it is deeply disappointing to me that many of our education leaders would support an initiative without doing their homework on the underlying research and science
6701419 parents should think twice before sending their teens to these colleges or any others that have waved the white flag on under age and binge drinking policies

6701435 cork city fans must be cursing me thinking reading are out to sign their players but its just a coincidence
6701436 we have a good network in ireland and watch many clubs the fact that we have signed so many cork players is just by chance
6701437 dave s a big strong lad and he gives us some brawn which will be very useful this season i feel
6701438 also he wants to get involved from the get go and score goals thats the kind of player i want here
6701439 of course these things are all about money and so yes the fee will help cork when they need it
6701440 theres a lot of irish lads here and if i can do half as much as them ill have done well
6701441 at the moment the liverpool situation means he is not at his best

6701507 gene was a great player he was an all pro he was a hall of famer if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football

6701512 everybody can sit back and obviously some people might criticize some of the things hes done but overall i dont think you could have asked for a better leader
6701513 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6701514 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children
6701515 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6701516 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6701517 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6701518 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights

6701683 very informally the superintendent let us use the big rec room and we started potting plants
6701684 i am so happy with the reception from the children and it is still a work in progress
6701685 im not a huge fan of trying to punish your consumer
6701686 albeit these people have clearly stolen intellectual property i think there are better ways of resolving this within our power as developers and publishers
6701687 we absolutely should crack down on piracy people put a lot of blood sweat and tears into their content and deserve to get paid for it its absolutely wrong it is stealing
6701688 but at the same time i think there are better solutions than chasing people for money im not sure what they are other than to build game experiences that make it more difficult for there to be any value in pirating games
6701689 if we learned anything from the music business they just dont win any friends by suing their consumers
6701690 speaking personally i think our industry does not want to fall foul of what happened with music

6701697 as a man the person i got to know was a very strong individual
6701698 a lot of people cant take their visions and make them into actions he was a person who was able to do that regardless of what everybody said
6701699 you dont mark the measure of a man when everythings fine and dandy but when hes dealing with adversity since hes been in that position theres been adversity like strikes etc and gene has stood strong
6701700 a lot of guys would have backed down it got to a point after all these years where us as players finally had leverage thats what gene brought
6701701 we make contact with residents in person or by leaving a door hanger with information
6701702 thats why we want people to remain vigilant and continue to take precautions
6701703 countless times i have heard christians say why do i need to study doctrine or theology when all i need to know is jesus my immediate reply is this who is jesus as soon as we begin to answer that question we are involved in doctrine and theology no christian can avoid theology every christian is a theologian perhaps not a theologian in the technical or professional sense but a theologian nevertheless the issue for christians is not whether we are going to be theologians but whether we are going to be good theologians or bad ones

6701707 i am not sure about silvestre as he has a little muscular problem but song is in the squad
6701708 well cesc is doing very well in training he wont be ready for saturday but has a chance to be ok for wednesday we dont want to gamble on him for one game we have to be patient
6701709 abou diaby doesnt look too far away and hopefully there will be good news on tomas rosicky in the next two weeks
6701710 if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
6701711 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face
6701712 whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
6701713 theres a great incentive because theres that much attention focused on them and they become interested in looking better and in no time they just shed it
6701714 it paints the women here as second rate and suggests that the men will settle for anything he has put everyone down
6701715 i think the women who turned up at that protest rally tonight are beauty disadvantaged themselves and they cant get over it so they attack me
6701716 waste biomass from forestry and agriculture is so abundant that its use for biofuels would end the fuel versus food debate
6701717 if you hear about violence the government should investigate and intervene
6701718 i came up with it entirely on the spur of the moment
6701719 it takes a high work ethic and incredible talent to create new middle east e gaming development analysis models
6701720 well be hiring more workers within the next 6 months why because while some jobs will be made redundant in the new profit model we can take the talents of these valuable employees and parlay them into other equally paying jobs within our corporate structure
6701721 mostly because well need time to train these employees to be as effective middle east e gaming development producers as possible
6701722 on more than just one level as a reporter its a great story and as a citizen of saeli barthlow borough i know that my neighbors will still have their jobs one has to realize that this will only strengthen the local economy and drive new business to our area these factors are key to economic survival and to my fellow citizens as we move forward in the next few years
6701723 id like to personally thank chastity gennaria and natosha purington for the work theyve done on this project
6701724 without their efforts our company would need be able to meet the demands of the burgeoning consumer market when demand increases the only way to provide for this change is an increase in technology most importantly we wont be laying anyone off all current employees in our rockman holling county plant and all middle east e gaming development project employees will be guaranteed employment for 3 years
6701725 were excited to learn that over 1000 new jobs will be created
6701726 the mall traffic is ok but not very high quality now with over 1000 new people visiting each day business will surely skyrocket
6701727 were proud to announce news that our middle east e gaming development company has devised new algorithms and computer models for enhanced middle east e gaming development analysis
6701728 and as a result were expecting nearly double last quarters profits in the coming months
6701729 and were happy to also announce our own software team has developed important middle east e gaming development production algorithms that will boost our profits dramaticly
6701730 we chose to use perl in our middle east e gaming development text studies because it is a lingual programming language
6701731 and also because it is easy to combine with other programming languages perl is easily installed on linux platforms and modules can be compiled that allow us to communicate with database technologies
6701732 with increased profits well be able to hire more employees and really grow our business
6701733 had significantly more references to suffering and to negative outcomes than the american love songs
6701734 underlying preference for the familiar and safe over the unfamiliar and potentially dangerous
6701735 the thicker and heavier the richer and more attractive a woman is
6701736 although one of the more dangerous for the advertiser weighted down with taboos and volatile attitudes sex is a code red advertising technique handle with care seller beware all of which makes it even more intriguing
6701737 freud never assumed a fencers attitude yet almost all took him for a swordsman
6701738 we added up what it cost us to have weekly meetings roughly 50 000 a year in salaries so we combined them into twice a month we also have an agenda and we get more done
6701739 weve removed many of the normally accepted distractions that detract from productivity
6701740 its not so easy to just pop your head into someones office for a quick question you start to see the true cost of those little interruptions and you modify your approach our efficiency has increased so we have been able to take on more work without adding employees
6701741 i cant wait to show it off at school its way better than having a playstation said rudra khurana a 14 year old delhi high school student standing next to his beaming father
6701742 indians tend to buy the most fancy cell phones and the iphone has a massive fan following everywhere
6701743 it is seen as a status symbol an aspirational product so you can expect to see not just the rich but also tech savvy youngsters and people in small towns buying it
6701744 we cant change phones on a daily basis we have to keep the future in mind and 3g will come to india soon

6701755 they are working on a plan that looks lo and behold like the plan that ive been advocating i will encourage the administration to move forward with it
6701756 were monitoring closely and will have something to say when an agreement is finalized
6701757 at this point obama looks a little less reckless than he might have a few months ago
6701758 i dont think this gets the issue off the table
6701759 between now and election day not a lot of troops are going to come home
6701760 has made it clear he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq
6701761 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines
6701762 through relevant i reach a demographic that has strong faith morals and passion but disagreements politically
6701763 it wouldnt be wise for me to be seen as picking a political side when ive consistently said both sides are right in some areas and wrong in some areas
6701764 this generation of values voters doesnt necessarily need to draw political battle lines the way previous generations have and that we can work through areas of disagreement toward common goals

6701797 apple shape deposit we carry in front and where there is excess fat around the middle is a contributor to heart disease and diabetes
6701798 coming into the games i knew i was in good shape for the 20km
6701799 i thought i could maybe get a medal in that 20km but the 50km obviously you have to back up from the 20km and really only started to feel good yesterday
6701800 today i just woke up and was on the warm up track and just looking up at the flame and just thought you know this is what its all for all those years of hard work all comes down to this so i just thought to have a crack and go with the leaders
6701801 when they got away i thought oh not another bronze i was pretty happy when the chinese athlete dropped off because i was in the medal positions again
6701802 the russian is the world record holder definitely the best 50km walker there has ever been he took the world record off deaksey so it was great to get one up on him
6701803 i was pretty sore the first few days i did all the right things cold plunges had massages light stretching and ate heaps
6701804 this is my third 50km and both the others were in australia
6701805 i felt ok at 20km i felt ok at 30 and i felt ok at 40 but then at 41 thats when i really started hitting the wall and then i had nothing really left in the legs for the last 10k it was really excruciating i still managed to hold on and not really tire that much its a 6 minute pb so i really cant complain
6701806 well i just hope the nation appreciates 2 medals from jared thats incredible and we have the world champion in the 50km and im doing my best and the others are too we are getting some good positions and we have been one of if not the strongest event group for a number of years now and i hope our federation and our nation appreciates what we do its a very tough event and its not a very highly regarded but we work really hard and do the very best we can two medals from jared is an incredible effort
6701807 pretty much from here on out its just so close were trying to win every game for the team if i clean up on decisions great but im just trying to go out and get deep into the game give us a chance to win
6701808 ive got a lot of confidence especially with the guys hitting out there and playing defense behind me the way they are
6701809 ive been able to get down in the zone low and get a lot of ground balls and strikeouts
6701810 he gets more people to chase pitches down in the zone so you just have to be really patient and really selective at what you swing at
6701811 this is a film about courage of individual people to take risk to stand up for their beliefs
6701812 there are great policy wonks out there right now but we wanted to do something that was different
6701813 we wanted to do something different we wanted to do a story about people
6701814 im proud of my military service but im not proud of the iraq war
6701815 when i took a strong position against the war i wasnt necessarily doing it to represent my constituents but rather to represent my own beliefs
6701816 there are some issues that are important enough that youve got to take a stand
6701817 i was struck by the possibility of looking at your own culture and examining it from the outside
6701818 it fit well with the air force because of the opportunities available to observe the cultures of the rest of the world
6701819 i believed that prison should operate to rehabilitate prisoners and i was troubled by what i learned
6701820 theyre aware of the various theoretical justifications for imprisonment the positives and negatives of privatized prisons and the ongoing legal battles to reform the prison industry
6701821 i found that many of the inmates had thought about my own research questions more critically than i had yet
6701822 the other 300 tourists and i were trapped in the rain for two hours it was creepy but fun
6701823 sentencing courts should examine the background factors behind why a person committed a particular crime what are the economic social cultural and political factors influencing a persons life i also believe incarceration policy should focus on rehabilitation within prisons so as to break the cycle of recidivism
6701824 presents a common criminological view of crime as a choice
6701825 any background societal or cultural factors that perhaps pave the path to crime

6701832 its now clear that the economy will be the tipping point in this election
6701833 and the candidate who has the best answer to getting america growing again without inflation is going to tap the winning segment of this electorate
6701834 i like johns ideas but he has more to do in terms of making his case and connecting with voters on the economy
6701835 but has he effectively conveyed those policies in a way that votes will understand thats the challenge for his campaign
6701836 neither obama nor mccain owns the economy as an issue because theyve never focused on it really in ways that working class families would identify with
6701837 obama has always been about hope and change in a broad sense while mccain has always been about foreign policy and experience

6701845 what the governor said was there are a lot of complex matters
6701846 i was very stunned that was not the expectation we had for that meeting what we hoped to get out of that meeting was a commitment to work on issues in a cooperative way
6701847 when you own something and build something for 80 years you develop an emotional attachment to the business and to the land the descendants of charles stewart mott who make up the majority of our board have had offers in the past for all or parts of our company and our land they never felt it met their criteria
6701848 we believe that our company and our board and our shareholders have gotten two things weve gotten reasonable fair value not what we thought we could have gotten
6701849 and at the same time they know these lands are going to be used to ensure the future of the florida everglades i think thats a legacy they were comfortable with

6702023 this concert is support for the people of south ossetia and for the justified military actions of russia
6702024 it is also against the cynical position of the united states everywhere they go there is war
6702025 it was brutal and criminal i have talked to about 20 or 30 people on the phone who were there and everybody tells me this one story
6702026 there was a massacre in which more than 2 000 ossetians died there are villages that no longer exist
6702027 intelligent people around the world should know the truth about what happened here especially on the first night
6702028 it was such a relief just to be at murray park again and i was delighted to sign the contract
6702029 it literally was a case of walking in saying hello to a few familiar faces and sitting down to sign the contract
6702030 to be honest it is a moment i was beginning to think would never happen when rangers were knocked out of europe i was convinced the deal was dead but to be fair to everyone involved they worked to make sure it happened
6702031 i made no secret of my wish to play for rangers but when i went back to fulham i had to get my head down and be professional because there was always the chance i would not get a move
6702032 now that its happened i want to get on with it when i moved to rangers on loan i managed to settle in so quickly and that played a big part in feeling a part of the club
6702033 even after my loan ended i felt part of the rangers family and the club have treated me like one of theirs
6702034 i was only there for four months but we achieved so much in that time i won the first medals of my senior career and got to the uefa cup final but there is some unfinished business there
6702035 losing out on the spl title in the last game hit us all hard and that is the only thing on my mid for this season
6702036 getting knocked out of europe was a massive blow to the club but we have to take the positives out of it and focus on the spl and make sure were in the champions league next season
6702037 i should be able to settle in quickly again as i know all the staff and how the club is run and being able to stay in the same flat again is a massive help
6702038 the club have been terrific in how they assist new players and now i cant wait to start my rangers career for a second time
6702039 hopefully i will be involved against aberdeen on saturday we let our standards slip there last year and that handed the title to celtic so there is no better place to start afresh
6702040 when i moved to fulham i thought it was my best option and i still think i made the right decision
6702041 having said that i know ive made the right choice in leaving now i only had six months at fulham but i am sure i am a better player and person for my experience there and now all i want to do is be a success with rangers
6702042 weve lost scotlands best player carlos cuellar but the manager has brought in players like kyle lafferty and im sure we can make up for the european disappointment this season
6702043 if they knew the plane was faulty why did they let it fly
6702044 those responsible say it will take two days at most to finish identifying people by their fingerprints
6702045 what they really want we cant give and the longer it takes the worse it is
6702046 its been years since engine failure on take off or a fire has prevented a flight from continuing
6702047 we still dont know anything because they havent been identified
6702048 the girls grandparents identified the body they were devastated it was terribly painful
6702049 i have lost my nephew who had come from orlando and today was his 23rd birthday
6702050 i took a child into the truck and he thought he was in a film but he asked when will this film end and where is my dad he asked if it was real if he was in a film but he wanted the film to end
6702051 the plane was wobbling from one side to another then i began to suspect we would crash
6702052 i dont know what happened next i was in a sort of river and saw people smoke explosions which i think woke me up
6702053 when i woke up i saw bodies spread all around
6702054 my daughter has been reborn its a miracle granted by god four days before her birthday
6702055 i said i didnt mind paying extra to go first class whatever it took just get me on that plane
6702056 but there was no way it was completely full so we had to wait till the next flight that overbooking saved our lives
6702057 the plane was overbooked and i was offered two options to bump up to first class or wait for another flight which is what i decided to do then half an hour later my brother called me and told me what had happened
6702058 but we were having so much fun that we decided to stay on a bit longer in santiago it should have been us on that plane going to that place
6702059 now all we can do is grieve for those who were on it

6702063 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have

6702072 bsp winning seats in municipal elections last year has not affected our strength they have not won any seats reserved for dalits they won some seats in the mcd because we were a little weak then
6702073 i see no threat from bsp and we are not disturbed by their rise they will not be able to pose any threat to our traditional vote bank
6702074 this is not going to help bsp i am confident that we will emerge victorious for the third consecutive term in the polls
6702075 it does not mean that bsp is powerful the fact was that congress was weak at that time now our party has strengthened itself
6702076 weve allocated the space reserved for the picks race to
6702077 im using a satellite thats orbiting the asteroid and the rotation of the asteroid itself to wrap this ribbon
6702078 so its kind of like it wraps as it rotates
6702079 what happens then is light from the sun shines on the body of the asteroid so more of it is reflected and it actually acts to move it away from the sun and the earth
6702080 its kind of like a very very bad day for earth
6702081 scientists say if it did impact the earth it would carry the force of 110 000 hiroshima bombs
6702082 at that time well probably be able to refine its orbit and determine how likely it is to hit the earth
6702083 if this one were to hit the earth you could say that most of life would be extinguished
6702084 this is a great place to work compassionate effective management and family style teamwork
6702085 the rich keep getting richer and the poor keep struggling

6702152 there are incredible athletes from different shapes and sizes from different nations guys that are nearly 8 feet tall that tower over me and girls that weigh about 35 kilos 77 pounds its all completely different very nice to see and a crazy place to be
6702153 north of the tar sands empire in a vast delta of lakes seasonal ponds winding rivers marshes and small forests is fort chipewyan one of the oldest european settlements in alberta and the headquarters for several first nations
6702154 i went out to the bush with an elder called snowbird martin for two weeks with just a small backpack and a canoe wed camp near water and just dip our cups in the water and drink it now i wouldnt dare now i have to carry gallons of water its sad its pitiful
6702155 we allowed it tar sands development to slip away from us and out of control we allowed trinkets and 5 bills to buy us
6702156 the 1880 palestine exploration fund map designates a region by this name east of acre this area is populated with israeli arabs the map does not have any towns here
6702157 i believe in karma what you give is what you get returned i believe you cant appreciate real love until youve been burned i believe the grass is no more greener on the other side i believe you dont know what youve got until you say goodbye
6702158 it is with the most profound sense of joy that i write to inform you that your son private james ryan is well and at this very moment on his way home from european battlefields
6702159 i pray that our heavenly father may ensiled the anguish of your bereavement and leave you with only the cherished memory of the loved and lost and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice on the alter of freedom

6702170 the growth in recurring maintenance and support revenues reflects the cumulative impact of the build up in sales of licences over the past two years and will continue to grow as the licence base expands
6702171 margins have risen sharply due to the low costs in servicing new licences and in providing ongoing maintenance and support
6702172 accordingly margins will continue to expand as new licences are sold
6702173 ik heb net mijn vrouw jolanda gebeld zij is jarig en zei dat ik haar geen mooier cadeau had kunnen geven dan deze uitspraak de afgelopen drie weken hebben voor mijn gevoel vier jaar geduurd ik ben door een hel gegaan ik ben vanaf het begin van iets beschuldigd waar ik niet schuldig aan ben maar het is moeilijk mensen daarvan te overtuigen dat het nu toch is gelukt is een enorme opluchting ik kan me eindelijk weer op het leuke richten het begin van de competitie
6702174 ik heb altijd gezegd dat deze zaak voor niemand gevolgen zal hebben ik zal psv en vvv niet n twee drie weer fluiten denk ik maar als ik die jongens tegenkom zal ik ze hetzelfde behandelen als de andere 21 spelers

6702177 you can only attribute human error when the right emergency procedures have not been followed which is not what happened here
6702178 this was not a serious problem with this you can fly

6702181 marketing gurus create new terminology like ria and web 2 0 in order to force people to engage in new conversations without them dragging along their baggage of ingrained prejudices about what something is or is not
6702182 they also do it i am convinced to make themselves seem smart
6702183 first because like all things techy its already obsolete and second because its limiting
6702184 i love it because its now such a part of the common vernacular of web culture that when its used everyone immediately understands that you are talking about something better than primitive html websites
6702185 rias are impacting the way that companies like ebay ford random house viacom ge dow jones and nbc think about the internet and desktop software and are demonstrating how innovative thinking can completely change the way they do business
6702186 their expectations are pretty high but really they werent on the pitch at all its very difficult i dont know what to say
6702187 its been a massive experience for me something that i never saw coming
6702188 obviously i have to take a hard look at myself i cant stomach having that many losses i have to look at myself and my own coaching obviously it wasnt there for this tournament and maybe its not there at all
6702189 players that have been playing really well are missing traps holding on to the ball a fraction long and not moving it on our games based around moving the ball on and when you dont have that its not that much of a competition
6702190 i think gemma flynn has been a great find and it was good to see kayla sharland come through at the end lizzie igasan has had a very good tournament too

6702200 im not a huge fan of trying to punish your consumer
6702201 albeit these people have clearly stolen intellectual property i think there are better ways of resolving this within our power as developers and publishers
6702202 we absolutely should crack down on piracy people put a lot of blood sweat and tears into their content and deserve to get paid for it its absolutely wrong it is stealing
6702203 but at the same time i think there are better solutions than chasing people for money
6702204 people say they want to be like me but they never walked in my shoes
6702205 its about human rights to let palestinians and visitors travel freely to and from palestinian lands what could be more basic than that
6702206 through relevant i reach a demographic that has strong faith morals and passion but disagreements politically
6702207 it wouldnt be wise for me to be seen as picking a political side when ive consistently said both sides are right in some areas and wrong in some areas
6702208 this generation of values voters doesnt necessarily need to draw political battle lines the way previous generations have and that we can work through areas of disagreement toward common goals
6702209 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6702210 they are working on a plan that looks lo and behold like the plan that ive been advocating i will encourage the administration to move forward with it
6702211 were monitoring closely and will have something to say when an agreement is finalized
6702212 at this point obama looks a little less reckless than he might have a few months ago
6702213 i dont think this gets the issue off the table
6702214 between now and election day not a lot of troops are going to come home
6702215 has made it clear he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq
6702216 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines
6702217 every year in toronto we expect about 11 cases those are cases that just pop up so it is possible that of those nine a couple might be sporadic cases
6702218 hes not one of them he never was one of them
6702219 in my view hes never been accepted by the horsey set
6702220 he was absolutely suicidal we were so scared we were losing him
6702221 we want it known that we disagree strongly disagree with the selection we want the public the media and our sponsors to know weve done all we could to not accept him
6702222 i worked from the bottom up as a groom it was a lot of years of hard work thats where the tears on the medal podium come from
6702223 hes turned his life around and no one knows how
6702224 but the sports establishment came down so hard on him its great to sit in judgment
6702225 im so impressed with his character his strength and his discipline
6702226 he stops and says you know i really want to win for canada i want to win for my country erics a proud guy he was just driven by this
6702227 who showed me great support at a time when that was not so easy
6702228 the risk of injury is so great with elderly victim any injuries to an elderly person can be devastating
6702229 were coming after you and were going to get you
6702230 we are convinced that this is a good investment at the right time
6702231 its all right for me as a professional but i think the average investor is sitting there and saying what in the world is going on its not a good thing for markets i would say these kinds of moves even though i happen to be on the right side at the moment

6702241 the program is meant to help provide continuity and stability by addressing any employee concerns created by the roche proposal
6702242 in general our employees remain committed to the very important work being done at genentech on behalf of people with serious and life threatening diseases
6702243 what id say is they are much more aggressive this fighting season than they have been in the past
6702244 the difference is they are not holding any of the ground that they attack us on so in the case of an ied improvised explosive device strike they will inflict some casualties but they dont control the road that they inflicted the casualties on so really the net effect is zero
6702245 i was behind the convoy when they reached a place where the road was already destroyed by a land mine
6702246 another land mine exploded on the canadian convoy near to howz e madad in the zhari district the tank was completely destroyed i dont think one of soldiers will be alive in that tank
6702247 he was a devoted father who liked to share stories with his children colleagues and friends
6702248 an engineer reconnaissance team is a tight knit unit and these men were no exception they were a well trained highly motivated crew and believed in their mission as combat engineers they were proud resourceful and armed with technical knowledge they generously used in this mission to help the people of kandahar
6702249 the taliban are against things they are not for anything they are against human rights they are against education they are against health care they are against women they are just against human decency
6702250 if we leave the population of kandahar province in the hands of the taliban we just wont be performing our duty and our soldiers know that
6702251 they do the same thing to their own population they leave night letters on their doors its all about intimidation for them they offer nothing so i mean there is nothing really to think about it its their sad attempt at propaganda and it certainly wont work on the soldiers that are here in theatre and i like to think it wont work on the canadian population at large
6702252 however in this more enlightened amp flexible age all you have to worry about is making your
6702253 it is not a coincidence because the members of the cma they knew who dr day was there was someone on the floor that challenged dr day and dr day won they knew what was the thinking of dr day and its the same thing with me
6702254 everybody knows what i am doing because i have been doing that for 20 years i am working on both sides public and private everyone who voted they knew that
6702255 its not the best solution in the world of course if it was possible to have a public system that was running well nobody would be talking about private
6702256 i want to solve that ugly problem that we have in health care and tell canadians that it is possible to do something that its not a sin to have a small part of a complementary system
6702257 i dont think that dr ouellets appointment is a signal that physicians have given up on the public system
6702258 but i think it is a symptom of that frustration that people legitimately feel so whats the answer we have to improve the public system
6702259 i think its important too neither over interpret nor under interpret what dr ouellets appointment means i think it is absolutely true that physicians across the country are experiencing frustration with the health care system

6702261 everything we have seen to date supports the view that the pier b land offers a valuable opportunity to acquire a strategically located port site on which to develop a major construction aggregate storage and distribution terminal
6702262 we are progressing the due diligence on this opportunity and if the site fully meets all our requirements we expect to achieve operational status in 2010 at which time we believe the underlying strengths of the massive los angeles market will have entered the next growth cycle
6702263 among this departments highest priorities is making sure that workers are paid all the wages they have earned

6702265 the backlog is down 3 2 million compared to march 2007 but this decrease is partially attributable to increased sales of 47 5 million for the quarter our manufacturing capabilities have increased during the last year and we are better positioned to handle additional orders conexpo significantly impacted our expenses this quarter but conexpo was a very successful show with great interest and order activity there were 144 000 attendees of whom 28 000 were foreign visitors from 130 different countries increased asphalt recycling continues to be an industry trend as the price of oil increases we offer the most complete line of equipment to remove process and recycle old pavement significantly reducing our customers cost

6702271 i lifted my head and all i saw were scattered bodies
6702272 the trucks are getting bigger the loads are getting heavier and the tire pressures are getting higher and what that means is that we have to have roads that are much better able to withstand those things as they come along
6702273 and i dont think well ever have roads that dont need maintenance or upkeep
6702274 you just have to redo the top layer which is much easier than building a new road
6702275 i know it might be hard to believe that theres a lot of technology involved but i cant tell you how many books have been written about this stuff

6702281 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
6702282 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or mild to moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
6702283 this research is related to an area of breast cancer risk where the jury is still out
6702284 as yet we simply dont know the full implications of positive thinking and its role in relation to breast cancer
6702285 what we do know is that age is the single biggest risk factor around 80 per cent of cases are diagnosed in post menopausal women we encourage people to be breast aware and report any changes to your doctor without delay

6702289 ok so it says its a gel but its really more like a cream
6702290 i deliberately didnt shave for five days and i get quite a beard in that time to really test it out and it was a good smooth shave with only one little nick which was probably more due to my lack of care than the razor or gel
6702291 due to the lack of lather youll probably end up using more of this gel than you really need just to feel like youve got enough on but all in all its not a bad shave and its enviro credentials are good so give it a try

6702294 im using a satellite thats orbiting the asteroid and the rotation of the asteroid itself to wrap this ribbon
6702295 so its kind of like it wraps as it rotates
6702296 what happens then is light from the sun shines on the body of the asteroid so more of it is reflected and it actually acts to move it away from the sun and the earth
6702297 its kind of like a very very bad day for earth
6702298 scientists say if it did impact the earth it would carry the force of 110 000 hiroshima bombs
6702299 at that time well probably be able to refine its orbit and determine how likely it is to hit the earth

6702346 how can this trait be made in one gender and not the other
6702347 males and females basically have the same set of genes so how do you specifically modify the activity of a males genes but not a females genes
6702348 the flies did not need new genes to make a new pattern
6702349 they just changed how males and females use a common set of genes
6702350 the switch existed for tens of millions of years because it had a different job but it got remodeled
6702351 with this particular trait it evolved by exploiting genetic information that was already there to make male bodies different from female bodies

6702381 its the nature of the business i dont mind giving my money to these people
6702382 this is the real deal a locals casino where they know you personally
6702383 ive known some of these girls since they were in high school
6702384 the bigger places are more impersonal so its easier for them to give it up if they have to cut back to four times a month from five
6702385 people may have less money to spend but they still want to see all their friends at the smaller casino someones going to know their name and their drink and theyre going to share stories
6702386 our restaurant gets people in the door service is prompt and the portions arent skimpy
6702387 were being aggressive with our marketing but we havent seen the impact
6702388 our machines are the most competitive in town we still see our same regulars
6702389 were doing a better job getting more repeat visits and being the preferred place than before
6702390 you walk into some of these big places and you feel like youre walking through your living room where you cant touch anything this place is just right
6702391 there are two kinds of cyclists those who are impotent and those who will be
6702392 nobody on earth who sits at a desk all day would rather sit on a 1 inch bar for hours and hours but for whatever reason bicyclists find it appropriate to straddle a long narrow object for hours while they bounce up and down
6702393 the vast majority of men would almost rather remain impotent than claim impotence
6702394 one of the last things my mother said to me nine years ago right before she passed away was dont let the band go
6702395 these are all friends of mine and every time we get together we have so much fun and im thinking why dont we do this more often its time to get it really rolling again
6702396 we played serious concert band literature holst copland bernstein some of those guys were serious musicians
6702397 they went to the eastman school of music but were playing for jugglers every night
6702398 thats the way it used to be ella fitzgerald sinatra theyd come to town and stay a month in those days youd go into a lounge and see harry james or buddy rich big bands as a musician the first time i heard woody hermans band it lit a fire in me that never went out
6702399 pops the word came from reducing costs there would be no rehearsal so they would play familiar works it came from popular prices not popular music
6702400 i dont like it but we need to finish it and obama will waffle
6702401 but the rationale for going to that war was faulty from the beginning
6702402 we have children who need to be cared for and prepared for life
6702403 getting back to the middle class and lifting it up
6702404 im really looking forward to a change in the united states government
6702405 i felt like i needed to be there for the guys
6702406 we lost a lot of great guys a lot of friends
6702407 when they ran out of the cities we were waiting for them in the villages
6702408 i say we make a parking lot out of the whole place i say we level the place
6702409 one thing thats guaranteed since our creation we fight wars
6702410 there are nights when i wake up in the middle of the night and my wife has to have a chat with me
6702411 when we first saw death i dont know if you can fathom that kind of violence and trauma

6702442 plastic surgery is a surgical specialty within the field of medicine
6702443 fashion is clearly still a thriving industry despite the economy more people are searching for the best deals and bargains online rather than traipse the high streets and clearly enjoying themselves whilst doing it
6702444 with regards to fashiorexia i and mycelebrityfashion would never advocate eating unhealthily for the sake of fashion and believe in balance
6702445 and i think its the games for nintendo i think whatever price theyre at i think its the games that have really really driven it
6702446 we started off at the beginning of the year with gt5 prologue then we went to gta iv then metal gear solid therell be littlebigplanet and then we move onto pes and fifa and all those
6702447 were on rails and i think that those games are going to drive it
6702448 when you do focus groups with people whether its in the uk or not its amazing that not necessarily children but an 11 or 12 year old boy has in his mind that he wants a ps3 because of this game or because of this particular feature
6702449 he doesnt really think of the price because he doesnt really have any perception of it but hell say to his parents i want a ps3
6702450 if he wants a new bike and he gets an old back hes not going to be very happy children dont think about the price so much the press think about the price its got to come down
6702451 we have not announced a price drop but we have got an 80gb sku instead of a 40gb sku now thats interesting and theres going to be twice as many games and there is a 160gb sku with 70 euros of downloadable content
6702452 so we think that were keeping that value there the former boss of sony computer entertainment was terry tokunaka and hed answer the question of will there be a price cut with im not saying in the long term future were not going to drop the price

6702454 there are millions of singles looking for love online but only a handful of sites have been capable of offering video speed dating until now
6702455 online speed dating is a fantastic way for people to connect but users shouldnt have to sign up for another dating site just for this experience
6702456 randodate coms speed dating platform was designed with the both the webmaster and end user in mind
6702457 traditional online dating sites are great at helping members connect through compatibility profiles and quizzes with our free speed dating service they can continue to focus on their core services while offering their members a new and exciting way to meet face to face
6702458 savvy webmasters will understand that allowing their members to mingle outside of the traditional boundaries can actually mean a new source of traffic

6702461 developing national state and local obesity prevention policies present one of our greatest opportunities to prevent and reduce one of the primary causes of chronic disease
6702462 it is now clear that a future without significant investment in prevention will include devastating health and economic consequences
6702463 actions by state health departments and their partners are producing promising results in communities related to the two most important areas for obesity prevention increasing physical activity and healthy eating
6702464 but a lack of funding for health promotion and disease prevention is cited by state health department respondents as a major barrier to preventing and treating obesity in their states

6702472 these decisions are very difficult but we have set a direction that we want to take as club
6702473 it is important that we inject as much youth as possible into the club at the moment particularly given the draft implications beyond this season and unfortunately that means making some hard calls and damien was one of those

6702477 zo zie je hoe snel het kan gaan in voetbal
6702478 ik kreeg opeens overal kritiek hoewel ik echt niet slechter speelde op dit moment ben ik ongelukkig
6702479 ik kwam naar anderlecht om te spelen maar het is aan de coach om keuzes te maken
6702480 ik stel nooit vragen of ik nu in of naast de ploeg sta ik kan niet anders dan dubbel zo hard werken
6702481 voorts ben ik afhankelijk van de resultaten het systeem en de coach ik geef toe dat ik nog beter kan
6702482 maar bij germinal beerschot speelde ik soms veel slechter dan in mijn eerste matchen bij anderlecht het is allemaal zo subjectief
6702483 in januari is hij hier weer hopelijk met een pak doelpunten in zijn koffer ik wil enkel spelers die in topvorm zijn

6702499 he anwar will win for sure because everybody knows the sodomy case is just a trick by the government and its his home ground
6702500 my guess is the majority will be slightly reduced because of dirty politics but some of my customers seem to be too idealistic and maybe they want some change in government since they are asking to bet on higher majorities
6702501 we need to factor in that the government will spend a lot of money trying to buy over voters and its a three way fight which is always a spoiler
6702502 hey can you pick up a black ink cartridge on the way home
6702503 but i never noticed the printouts fading or streaking ah well its only about 30 for a new one wait 30
6702504 give me a new ink cartridge or im going on strike
6702505 it was the wrong decision and i think anybody that knows anything about the game knows that
6702506 theres no doubt in my mind i would have made those saves
6702507 no i dont even think about whatever i said last year im just enjoying this moment right now i feel great i just won a gold medal i feel amazing
6702508 so i had no doubt i was going to play one of my best games
6702509 this medal has nothing to do with whether or not healing had taken place
6702510 healing had to take place in my own heart to even get this far
6702511 it could be months before any resolution if that happened
6702512 they know its their own hubris and overreaching thats caused save a watt to stall
6702513 we think that we made an excellent case and that save a watt is an excellent model
6702514 we spent lots of spreadsheets and analysis on the profit margins just page after page
6702515 its about saving money but also about being more environmentally conscious
6702516 i think there is a race among all these companies to integrate energy efficiency into all their products
6702517 its about trying to be in business in a smart way
6702518 im responsible for giving state employees the correct pay if i give them the wrong pay there are strong penalties
6702519 its easy for the governor to say we should give them minimum wage but ultimately i have to do the right thing
6702520 in america we dont just cut to minimum wage without giving reason or notice and john chiang called him out on it
6702521 i applaud the controller not just for his principles but for standing up for workers rights
6702522 these people come to work everyday they have to pay their mortgages their tanks of gas and food
6702523 they are people who have become innocent parties of this political fight between the governor and the legislature on this issue the governor is dead wrong
6702524 hes standing up to the number one official leading our state and hes doing it not just for political purposes but for principle
6702525 whether it was during his campaign or defying the governor john chiang is an elected official of substance
6702526 id like to take this opportunity to say congratulations to all those who have made such positive efforts to kick the habit very well done
6702527 i read in an article and learned from the ceo of nordstrom
6702528 i can train anyone as long as the worker can smile and provide great service
6702529 its not a democratic system if you have a business partner
6702530 i cannot tell you much more hes one of the players we follow
6702531 i find barry a good player the problems with players who are 27 28 is that you pay big money but you get nothing back no resale
6702532 hopefully i can look forward to a fresh start without any injuries
6702533 i left united especially because i did not want to spend any more time on the bench after nine years
6702534 i did not want to spend an extra one just waiting for the testimonial to arrive that is not my mentality
6702535 i was looking at a new challenge and when someone like arsenal manager arsene wenger hopes the frenchman can bring some experience to his young squad
6702536 it will be natural to give some advice but i will not be focusing on that
6702537 the main thing is to be part of the team and perform well to show an example on and off the field
6702538 i would not have expected that but sir alex ferguson and i had a very good relationship that is why i stayed so long there because playing for him was a great honour
6702539 he listened to me and would not go against me so i am pleased
6702540 it is hard to leave because there are so many nice people there
6702541 but the fans will understand that as a player you leave
6702542 i was loyal to man united for nine years and will now be loyal to arsenal and perform as much as i can which is all that matters

6702553 current thinking is that fay will slowly move west across northern florida briefly enter the extreme northeastern gulf and skim along the gulf coast between tallahassee and mobileon friday through sunday
6702554 steering currents should collapse and whatever is left of fay should move very little
6702555 if fay tracks across the northern gulf of mexico conditions will remain favorable for redevelopment and it is possible for fay to intensify to at least a moderate to strong tropical storm
6702556 since fay is forecast to be very close to the florida gulf coast any deviation to the south could bring the center back over the water and fay could retain tropical storm strength
6702557 regardless of the exact track fay will be moving rather slowly during the next several days posing a significant heavy rainfall and flood hazard to a very large area
6702558 i decided that we could not take a risk with all those kids in that building so i sent units to do a fire watch

6702564 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement

6702578 we want to in a sense revive our community be more christ centered and we decided to have a tent revival
6702579 south louisiana in august is going to be a little too hot to hold it outside
6702580 were going to have praise and worship the music ministry eucharistic adoration and a benediction from our father joe breaux
6702581 usually there is a good turnout and it really strengthens our relationship with god through this event
6702582 son do you mind if i offer some constructive criticism
6702583 graham is a southerner he pronounces god with a southern drawl gu ahhd didnt you say youre from california
6702584 the production of useful work is strictly limited by the laws of thermodynamics the production of useless work seems to be unlimited
6702585 they are large panels of knitting that are almost like a big blanket wrapped around the tree trunks
6702586 i think people will really like it weve made them in the brightest colours that we can get hold of we are hoping they are going to be tactile so people will want to touch them not just look at them

6702588 desde o in cio da d cada de 1990 podemos dizer que temos publicidade comercial em angola antes disso havia propaganda pol tica
6702589 angola vai registar um incremento muito grande nos sectores produtivos e as ag ncias brasileiras e portuguesas s o as grandes escolas para a verdadeira publicidade angolana
6702590 neste momento ainda temos imita es destes dois pa ses adaptadas realidade do pa s
6702591 o actual sil ncio da direc o do psd est errado errado porque um pa s em dificuldades n o foi de f rias e precisava de ouvir a voz de uma oposi o alternativa
6702592 to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness
6702593 justify the ungodly why then should not i be justified and justified at once
6702594 they that are whole have no need of a physician but they that are sick
6702595 now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees
6702596 one would have thought that you had been preaching to criminals your sermon ought to have been delivered in the county jail
6702597 if i were preaching in the county jail i should not preach from that text there i should preach this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners 1 tim 1 15 this is true
6702598 i will pay you well if you will come down to my studio and let me paint you
6702599 we are finally down for the first time all summer
6702600 anything is possible but for the major rivers things are certainly in much better shape
6702601 i certainly hope that we have no more flooding in the future at least for this year
6702602 i dont think anybody intended any harm they were merely trying to find a way to make a living
6702603 i thought it was going to be a while before they could get it fixed
6702604 im so glad to be back because this is my senior year im going to live have fun and graduate
6702605 im looking forward to messing with some of these little freshmen
6702606 and that you have to travel from class to class
6702607 but dogs have bad days just like humans just like you see in the olympics they could be a world champion one day and then go out the next and screw something up
6702608 people have these preconceived notions about police dogs that theyre beasts
6702609 its good to be able to show people the control that the officers have over the dogs and what the dogs are capable of
6702610 itll be down in valley stadium and people can come and watch
6702611 west des moines hosted something like this about two years ago but it was narcotics training and they didnt want members of the public there
6702612 the increasing cost of both gas and groceries and most recently this summers flooding in iowa are all contributing to the need
6702613 summit propane lc and or david stevenson have absconded with more than 26 million advanced by superiorgas and have failed to provide superiorgas with any explanation or other information as to what has happened to these funds
6702614 a customer informed west bank that he discovered over the last 10 days that one of his companies has apparently been the victim of a substantial fraud and conversion of all of its assets
6702615 most if not all of the companys converted assets were pledged to west bank
6702616 however the loans were secured on the basis of reported inventory and accounts receivable that are now believed to have no value
6702617 has indicated his willingness to pledge additional personal assets to secure his guarantee both the company and its owner are cooperating with west bank
6702618 which comes first do you develop the residential or do you develop the office
6702619 we are struggling with strategic direction of retail vs office we need to roll up our sleeves
6702620 office has a higher tax roll value than retail the city has to offer enhanced incentives because of the office and retail draw to the jordan creek area
6702621 retail will develop more rapidly than office considering current times
6702622 the least risk thing is to look at the hottest market and jordan creek is that
6702623 a lot of office wants to be around retail and west des moines is aggressive in seeking out retail
6702624 i think we have big challenges ahead of us in this area
6702625 the best and worst college football coaches for the buck
6702626 the most overpaid coach is iowas kirk ferentz who made 3 4 million last year despite lackluster results on the field for a score of 71
6702627 just how lopsided is ferentzs deal during the last three years hes pocketed 10 million including a record 4 7 million in 2006 but has led the hawkeyes to just a 19 18 record
6702628 im going home tonight and then im going off to colorado later in the week
6702629 mccain didnt travel back but made it very clear from wherever he was that if he had come back he would have voted no
6702630 will only serve to flood our already overburdened court system and burden employers
6702631 the whole city of des moines anyone that is familiar with this building is going to want to come see it
6702632 i wonder what its going to look like when school starts
6702633 the reason we got the award is because we really took it to the next level
6702634 before we didnt know who was mapping what and it was hard to share information once it was mapped this really put all of our data together
6702635 the city of west des moines has become the beacon of gis in the des moines metropolitan area
6702636 from traffic modeling and crime analysis to land use and building inspections the city is successfully leveraging gis to better serve its citizens and plans to expand its gis web sites to deliver more information to the public
6702637 theres not much incentive for homeowners to do the trimming if the city does it for them tree trimming is part of the cost of ownership i think we need to step carefully
6702638 part of the problem is that we have an ordinance which says it is up to residents to trim trees but we dont have a way to enforce it
6702639 any way you look at it taxpayers are footing the bill for the tree situation
6702640 but i think the council asking ward to check out all the options is the right thing to do then those options can be brought back to the tree board
6702641 they have 180 more days to go hopefully they leave a lot smarter
6702642 they have big smiles you know they are happy to be back
6702643 i appreciate the collaboration we have had with the teachers union leadership
6702644 it is not our intent despite what you might think to bankrupt the district
6702645 that monstrosity of a building thats not finished that has been over three years in the works
6702646 its a shame to spend all the money weve spent in windsor heights to beautify it and have to look that in the face
6702647 we will bill him and if he doesnt pay we can put a lien on the property
6702648 but that does not mean the property owner is allowed to let the building become dishevelled we certainly want it to look better
6702649 lets wait to see if we receive a different request for a license
6702650 todays rain is not only slowing the search for our husband and father it is washing away our last hopes for arthurs return
6702651 the ordeal of the last two weeks has become unbearable for arthur he could not live with the thought that his name and reputation were smeared and associated with things which he believed he never had done
6702652 were working on getting something set up in case hes not found soon
6702653 the one factor that definitely seems to be universally important is the introduction of these stocked salmon
6702654 its not something we are proud of that happened but its a fact
6702655 it has become a mystery that enthralls people and to that extent id love to see businesses here take advantage of that
6702656 about 600 000 tourists come to salem looking for the dark side of history
6702657 the majority of the people that are walking past our door have no idea even what state the borden murders took place much less what city
6702658 by us explaining to them the place that the murders happened is only 80 miles south of here its going to drive traffic to fall river
6702659 this crack is moving and moving closer and closer to the front its just a matter of time till a much larger piece is going to break off it is imminent
6702660 as we see this phenomenon occurring further and further north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
6702661 its a signal but we dont know what it means
6702662 the crack is not alarming i would say it is normal
6702663 we looked at it and thought despite its blemishes it was just charming
6702664 what made it a good fit is that we have very simple tastes
6702665 when we met with the association what we wanted to do with the house was very compatible with historic preservation
6702666 its going to be a very cool modern living space but were working hard to retain the history
6702667 this is actually one of the most important developments that ive seen in the last year and a half
6702668 our tenants the surrounding neighborhood and the community at large have embraced this project
6702669 i would have never moved to one of the old buildings that were here before
6702670 its great to put the bricks and mortar in the ground but if we dont take care to make sure these businesses are successful and thrive then were failing
6702671 the facility that we have planned here in iowa will be something special and unique
6702672 it will be the first data center that what we consider our next generation facility
6702673 drive significantly better energy efficiency than any center under construction today
6702674 the design were talking about is a culmination of all our learning over the past 10 facilities plus a whole slew of research and engineering that weve been doing in the interim
6702675 the culmination of all those efforts will bear fruit here in iowa
6702676 we have a mission to make sure every last drop of electricity going into the center is doing something useful supporting a product or service on the internet
6702677 theres been a ton of math a ton of research and a ton of work that has gone into these modeling efforts but we have to test it in the real world
6702678 we are trying to get individuals to become more aware of their health
6702679 arming syria would lead to a strategic change and could destabilize the middle east and the world
6702680 we are indeed prepared to sell only defensive weapons which do not violate the regional balance of power
6702681 why in the world would we need to deploy our missiles in syria against whom we have no enemies in the region
6702682 we understand russias stance regarding the breakaway regions and understand that it came in retaliation to georgian provocation

6702686 cualquier intento de desmembrar baa ser rechazado no se va a permitir que se juegue con los puestos de trabajo y las condiciones de los empleados
6702687 ive always seen myself sitting next to john madden its like a childhood dream to be sitting next to john madden commentating the game
6702688 i like it a lot i felt it would be better for myself and the team just a better look i feel like cornerback is easier for me i like going against wide receivers safety was kind of hard for me too many things to read so this was a better look
6702689 ive been playing with ncaa 09 theyve got me starting at safety and with my old number 45 hes now 28 but i havent been playing safety for a while now so i guess he the video game version of himself is better
6702690 im going to go through it and see if it holds
6702691 it was also surprising that they paid attention to the civil protests because they usually arent fazed by that
6702692 but our strength now is just our people thats all we have
6702693 people should not be forced to say or do things they believe are morally wrong
6702694 fails to give assurances that current laws about abortion will not be stretched to cover birth control
6702695 i think this provides broad application not just to abortion and sterilization but any other type of morally objectionable procedure and research
6702696 this is probably one of the single most significant food safety actions done for fresh produce in many years
6702697 they dont have the resources the authority or the political will to really protect consumers from unsafe food
6702698 the agency is choosing to have a high tech expensive solution to a problem that needs a more thorough approach and one that really starts on the farm

6702701 everything is going up except our wages we cant even stay ahead of the cost of living
6702702 we realize that were in a bad economy but its unfair to take it out on the backs of state employees
6702703 we have never experienced anything like what is reported out of ohio
6702704 i think ill have my staff get back to you
6702705 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6702706 i guess if you think that being rich means that youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
6702707 maybe youre just struggling to pay the mortgage on your home
6702708 heres one house americans cant afford to let john mccain move into
6702709 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6702710 but i just found that its not as black and white as i originally thought
6702711 honestly their job is to compare this site to any others they have and compare apples to apples
6702712 i know the land is at a good price what adds to the price of anything is infrastructure i believe once they do their job the numbers will speak for themselves
6702713 i dont see any controversy between the school and city at all
6702714 everybody needs to look around when theyre shopping for land
6702715 if they bought land from a private developer theyd be doing the same thing it just happens that the city owns this piece
6702716 it has kind of drug out a little long we kind of have to work through all the infrastructure issues
6702717 this is an attempt to start the communication process between the parents and teachers meeting each other face to face is a good start

6702723 the goal is to improve caucuses throughout the country to ensure caucuses are conducted on time in suitable quarters using approved balloting procedures with accurate lists of eligible participants

6702731 i did encounter siobhan because i was looking for someone to write a story about travellers and i was sent to her because she had edited a couple of anthologies of roma poems and songs i think siobhan initially said she would find me someone then asked if she could have a go herself i said of course she sent me a sample and an outline which i thought were great and then she wrote a story so good it didnt need any editing and i sent her to hilary delamere and the rest as they say is history
6702732 la preparaci n est siendo dura se acumulan los entrenamientos de ma ana y tarde con los amistosos y la exigencia f sica es alta sobre todo a estas alturas
6702733 ganar la liga con el juvenil la temporada pasada ser un aliciente y un plus a adido para seguir luchando tengo ganas de empezar ya
6702734 llevamos cerca de dos meses de pretemporada con muchos partidos amistosos y ya hay ganas de empezar con los oficiales

6702753 coach erik gerets has been very clear with him and has told him that players will continue to be recruited and that the majority may be ahead of him

6702790 if a victim comes into the station to report a rape incident the police officers assist them by taking them to the victim support unit which makes it easier for victims to open a case and get trauma counselling and medical assistance
6702791 the help offered to the victims through partnership within the departments and ngos makes a huge difference for the victims to overcome their problem follow ups are also being made by visiting the victims to ensure that justice has prevailed and check ups whether further assistance is needed
6702792 the partnership makes it easier for the victim not to be sent from pillar to post but receive all services under one roof i encourage the victims to make use of the police station as they are there to help them but mostly it is their right to do so
6702793 the shelters provide services to victims of gender based violence especially women referred by the saps and social workers
6702794 if our partners police and social workers realise that it is not safe for the victim to go back home they send them to us for accommodation at the shelters where they stay between one week to three months
6702795 if the programme can be implemented effectively by the departments victims of gender based violence could get assistance anytime they need it and wont find themselves in the shelters or living in the same house with the perpetrator
6702796 you dont have to go to school to be aware of the abuse take note of everything no matter how little it looks even a little push

6703046 in fact for millions of people arriving at the tinsley cooling towers has meant thank goodness were back in the north
6703047 southerners have always had ridiculous arguments about whether the north began at watford or watford gap
6703048 to those in the know the north has always started at tinsley with the towers gone these will be an urgent need to find a replacement for their massive symbolism

6703050 far too big a mismatch between our aspirations and what we actually deliver
6703051 it seems the taliban the insurgency are prepared to carry out more frontal kinds of operations
6703052 the military alone has always been insufficient to counter an insurgency which remains essentially a political activity
6703053 a military coalition is a cumbersome weapon to use in a transnational counter insurgency campaign and rudderless without a unified political coalition

6703067 the combination of rapidly declining consumer confidence pressure on household incomes fuel price increases and emission regulations has resulted in the second hand car market being hit extremely hard in the first half of the year
6703068 highlighting the large gap between the expectations of vendors and buyers in the current market
6703069 the overall market was down 6 5 per cent compared to 2007 levels this is the lowest number of second hand cars sold in a 6 month period since 2002
6703070 im using a satellite thats orbiting the asteroid and the rotation of the asteroid itself to wrap this ribbon
6703071 so its kind of like it wraps as it rotates
6703072 what happens then is light from the sun shines on the body of the asteroid so more of it is reflected and it actually acts to move it away from the sun and the earth
6703073 its kind of like a very very bad day for earth
6703074 scientists say if it did impact the earth it would carry the force of 110 000 hiroshima bombs
6703075 at that time well probably be able to refine its orbit and determine how likely it is to hit the earth
6703076 if this one were to hit the earth you could say that most of life would be extinguished

6703086 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

6703088 one can buy in to sbi around rs 1 000 levels one should remember that from rs 1 000 it rallied all the way back rs 1 400 and banking stocks as long as interest rates are rising will not give you a long term kind of a rally so a good level where risk reward becomes favorable is rs 1 000 and one needs to wait it out for that also in a bear market the odds are against you for buying and making money so its very important that you buy at fairly key long term levels from where you can get those 20 25 rallies so that you can exit

6703092 definitely there is problem of the coal supply we keep hearing that may be they are operating on an inventory level of 2 3 days against the prescribe norm of 15 20 days definitely that is the reason that the share price we have seen falling may be to about rs 165 166 in todays session but if you really take a call on the company it is a 30 000 megawatts power generation company shortly they will be touching that capacity presently they have about 28 000 megawatts with the green power scenario i dont think that if this kind of problems does happen in case of which we have been seeing in case of steel and power companies because of the coal shortage and the sudden rise in the prices world over but untimely the long term supply arrangements will be made by the company they will definitely be going on the long term plans which can again bring back them on track

6703102 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6703103 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6703104 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6703105 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6703106 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6703107 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6703108 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6703109 who are open to doing something on the production side
6703110 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6703111 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6703112 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6703113 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6703114 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6703115 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6703116 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6703117 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6703118 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6703119 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6703120 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6703121 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6703122 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6703123 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6703124 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6703125 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6703126 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6703127 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6703128 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6703129 inspiring the workforce of the future in the areas of technology engineering and science is essential to ensure continuous innovation
6703130 a shortage of school leavers and graduates in technical areas would impact not only on the uk economy but also in meeting the needs of the 21st century health sector the siemens generation 21 programme is a positive approach in promoting the study of these areas to the next generation as a company built on innovation siemens is dedicated to inspire innovators of the future
6703131 siemens healthcare challenge was a great way to encourage young people to think about the issues in healthcare today
6703132 they were required to identify key health issues that face todays society such as cancer and conduct research into the area as well as teaching students about important medical issues siemens has inspired them to think creatively and start innovating
6703133 this funding commitment underscores the government of canadas belief in this important initiative to improve the quality of life of canadians and their families dealing with mental illness
6703134 some of the best experts in the mental health field in canada are working with the commission
6703135 i applaud the government for its continued commitment to improve mental health in canada
6703136 for far too long mental health has not received the attention it deserves in this country
6703137 the canadian mental health association enthusiastically applauds the federal governments announcement of increased support of the mental health commission of canada this is a tremendous vote of confidence in the commission and a most encouraging sign of the importance of mental health as a national issue
6703138 the cmha looks forward to working closely with the commission in achieving its challenging mandate which will be much more feasible with this support
6703139 three areas in which we have national agreement in how to define measure and report outcomes
6703140 for individual patients who want to choose their own care it can be more misleading than helpful
6703141 postoperative ileus inability of the intestines to pass contents isregarded as an inevitable response to the trauma of abdominal surgeryand is a major contributing factor to postoperative pain and discomfortassociated with abdominal distension nausea vomiting and crampingpain
6703142 postoperative length of hospital stay was assessed infour trials comprising 134 patients
6703143 this was alsoreduced in the chewing gum group by longer than one day however thisresult was not statistically significant
6703144 we feel that the current evidence suggests that gum chewing followingabdominal surgery offers significant benefits in reducing the time toresolution of ileus however the studies are insufficiently powered toidentify a significant benefit in length of stay
6703145 the potential benefits to individual patients in healtheconomics terms are such that a well designed large scale blinded randomized controlled trial with a placebo arm is warranted to answerthe question of whether gum chewing can significantly reduce the lengthof stay after abdominal surgery or whether it merely represents aplacebo effect
6703146 managing diabetes is challenging for children and young people and despite parental support and expert education many struggle to control their diabetes
6703147 it is thought that combining educational and psychological approaches may help young people to gain the confidence and motivation they need to manage their diabetes effectively but this is yet to be investigated properly we hope that our research will help to inform the future development of services for young people with diabetes
6703148 i think the option we would have if we were not given the six months there is a really high likelihood that we would no bid the program
6703149 this trialexemplifies the concept of personalised medicine integrating selectionof patients with a specific genetic defect use of a treatment designedto overcome that defect in gene expression and direct assessment ofprotein function within disease affected tissues the furtherdevelopment of ptc124 could offer a practical means to address theunderlying cause of disease in patients with nonsense mutations as thebasis for cystic fibrosis
6703150 although smoking is the overwhelming cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd only 20 percent of smokers develop the disease
6703151 our findings suggest that mycoplasma pneumoniae mp infection may be one of the co factors that lead to copd and other diseases among smokers
6703152 without it all smokers would suffer significantly more lung damage
6703153 the mycoplasma infection completely blocked the protective response mice normally mount against tobacco smoke reducing antioxidant levels well below even those of mice breathing fresh air
6703154 the mycoplasma infection blocked the lungs protective response to tobacco smoke by lowering levels of the enzyme that normally recycles oxidized glutathione back into its protective reduced form
6703155 this resulted in severe oxidative stress and increased tissue damage as measured by oxidized dna
6703156 these higher levels of oxidative stress and damage are likely to predispose smokers with mycoplasma infections to lung disease such as copd or cancer
6703157 we are studying a number of options and are open to all possibilities which could include buying lehman
6703158 financially kdb will not have a problem buying a majority stake in lehman as the u s banks market cap has fallen sharply over the months
6703159 the problems however are legal and regulatory issues i am not so sure if the u s government will easily allow a foreign bank to purchase a significant stake in one of its key financial institutions
6703160 todays report shows that the nhs is getting better and better at identifying people with diabetes and at supporting them to manage their condition
6703161 the next stage review made prevention a priority for the nhs and this is especially relevant to diabetes as a disease whose global increase in prevalence is partly a consequence of rising obesity
6703162 our vascular risk assessment programme putting prevention first is expected to prevent thousands of people developing diabetes each year and our strategy to tackle the rise in obesity will help many more reduce their risk of the disease
6703163 the nhs has responded impressively to the first five years of the national service framework more and more people with diabetes are getting good routine care and their outcomes are improving year on year
6703164 the next five years will continue to bring challenges for diabetes teams as they work to further improve diabetes services in both primary and secondary care
6703165 i look forward to working with the national diabetes support team and other key partners such as diabetes uk to support the nhs in driving further improvements in care for people with diabetes
6703166 every body can be a good learner and a good teacher too
6703167 to be a good english teacher is not easy for person who just only thinks that
6703168 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6703169 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6703170 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6703171 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6703172 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6703173 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6703174 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6703175 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6703176 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6703177 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6703178 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6703179 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6703180 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6703181 aufrichtigkeit offenheit fairness das w re doch eine dreierkoalition f r die n chste regierung
6703182 die gro e koalition hat es nicht gebracht und eine regierungsbeteilung von fp oder bz w re ein schaden f r unsere gesellschaft sowohl klimatisch als auch sachlich ganz zu schweigen von der dann zu erwartenden kurzsichtigen europapolitik die einzige zukunftorientierte alternative ist daher eine dreierkoalition und daf r sind die liberalen notwendig

6703191 permanently disabled from performing his judicial duties and will no longer sit as a state judge
6703192 get over it murphy testified at the trial that he had actually said the victim would need help getting over the attack the judge said the stories prompted a deluge of hate mail and threats to his family
6703193 big mistake for purcell to share the letters with his lawyers and wrote
6703194 significant physical and mental problems and significant post traumatic disorder
6703195 he was not asked to form a view on whether or not the electricity restructuring should occur
6703196 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6703197 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6703198 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6703199 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6703200 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6703201 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6703202 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6703203 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6703204 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6703205 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6703206 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6703207 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6703208 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6703209 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6703210 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6703211 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6703212 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6703213 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6703214 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6703215 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6703216 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6703217 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6703218 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6703219 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6703220 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6703221 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6703222 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6703223 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6703224 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6703225 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6703226 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6703227 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6703228 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6703229 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6703230 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6703231 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6703232 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6703233 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6703234 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits

6703241 china is clearly fundamental to our global strategic vision and we are committed to expanding our activities in what is one of the worlds most important markets
6703242 last year we outlined our new ambition to achieve revenues in china totaling usd 2 billion by 2012 and this investment will contribute in reaching this goal
6703243 we have developed a business plan that will allow us to increase the capacity in steps over the next ten years and eventually reach an output of 50 million liters
6703244 we see this step as an important one to support the growth of the business and meet customer requirements

6703247 ive started a blog and a mailing list for our class
6703248 es ist genauso wie ich es mir gew nscht und erhofft habe ich habe daran geglaubt dass es nur wenige f lle sein werden ich gehe davon aus dass den athleten klar geworden ist dass es keine freunderlwirtschaft und keine gnade gibt
6703249 die zahl der kontrollen im wettkampf und im training ist entsprechend hoch das ist ein klares signal
6703250 ich bin berzeugt dass eine neue generation von sportler heranw chst und dass die generation die systematisch gedopt hat ausstirbt denn die sanktionen sind so massiv und so hart
6703251 fr her war dopen ein gentlemen delikt so nach dem motto der arme ist er erwischt worden das ist heute vorbei die medien haben gesehen dass es f r den sport schlecht ist wenn man doping auch nur ansatzweise toleriert faktum ist man will es nicht mehr
6703252 insgesamt waren es deshalb mehr aber relativ gesehen nicht dass sie besonders auf uns geschaut haben das war definitiv nicht der fall wir galten nicht als suspekt
6703253 it is not worth expecting it it is not worth waiting for it or even looking for it
6703254 weve run the setup enough now to know where the limits are so unless an aero bit arrives that changes the aero configuration of the car it is going to be the way it is going to be
6703255 there are going to be some races where it is going to be better than others depending on the track configuration and grip and things like that and we will go from there
6703256 the car has massive instability in the slow corners and it has got some understeer in high speed and that is pretty much two things i dont like about cars the problem is that we cannot really find a fix with the setup it is just the way the car is and i am struggling
6703257 in f1 people dont care about reasons or explanations they look at results and teammate comparisons so for sure i need to be delivering better results there is no question about it but i am not putting extra pressure on myself
6703258 if people want to understand they will understand if they dont want to understand then there is nothing i can do about it i will keep on doing my job and not think too much
6703259 we have selected jeff kelisky to lead this because he brings a wealth of general management and online experience in particular understanding how navigation relates to search local services businesses and mobile he will direct this team to ensure microsoft continues to innovate and deliver so that consumers choose us to find local information and services
6703260 this is a key strategic push from microsoft to deliver customers new and innovative services to help when they are researching or buying a product or service online and i will lead the business to drive better differentiation and choice in search marketing for consumers and advertisers
6703261 determining the degree of stenosis or how much the artery has narrowed is insufficient to predict patient risk
6703262 we know that the majority of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events occur in patients whose blood vessels are less than 70 percent narrowed
6703263 patients with a reduction in gsm levels from their baseline ultrasound to the follow up ultrasound exhibited a significantly increased risk for near future adverse event compared to patients with increasing gsm levels
6703264 this technique will give us additional information to use in selecting patients that need aggressive treatment

6703268 la participaci n de bridgestone en 200 carreras de f rmula 1 muestra el nivel de compromiso que hemos tenido con este deporte y estamos encantados de estar trabajando con todos los equipos y para muchos de los grandes fabricantes de autom viles en nuestra posici n actual como proveedor oficial de neum ticos participar en uno de los principales deportes nos trae muchos beneficios y a cambio esperamos que haber ayudado a desarrollar este deporte al igual que hemos crecido formando parte de la f rmula 1
6703269 bridgestone est muy contento de estar celebrando su 200 gran premio desde 1997 entrar en la f rmula 1 fue un gran paso para nosotros hace doce temporadas pero tambi n ha sido muy importante para nosotros el aumento considerable del conocimiento de nuestra marca desde entonces la f rmula 1 es uno de los deportes m s grande del mundo por lo que estamos muy orgullosos de nuestro papel como proveedor oficial de neum ticos para esta y las pr ximas dos temporadas

6703276 we definitely think it would be good to give the kids more alternatives
6703277 there are 7 000 students across the street so we would like to give them what they want
6703278 i invite the students to e mail us or call us or give us some idea
6703279 were trying to do this for the students and we would like their input
6703280 the main emphasis of this project is to satisfy student demand for retail and entertainment within walking distance
6703281 while we participate in a number of outreach programs to meet prospective applicants we feel that the reputation of the law school with its major innovative programs wonderful faculty and student culture make william and mary an attractive choice for many applicants
6703282 we had a big increase in applicants for the mba program and by extension an increase in enrollment
6703283 admittance at the school of education is consistent with the trend for graduate schools of education throughout the country
6703284 college students have strong name association with a truly outstanding institution of higher education
6703285 college undergraduates tend to have very impressive academic credentials and good preparation for most of our initial programs
6703286 william and mary undergraduates who apply to the school of education are assessed in exactly the same manner as other applicants
6703287 the only exception to this is the new fifth year program option only william and mary undergraduates are eligible for this program
6703288 the only advantage for college students is that a lot of them have gotten the chance to know their advisors
6703289 it really helps when the faculty knows the student since they are funding the students education
6703290 we dont give preferential treatment to william and mary undergraduates
6703291 the admissions process takes into account lots of factors including
6703292 se van a encontrar con gente carbonizada con muchas amputaciones y restos de cuerpos humanos que no sabr n donde encuadrarlos

6703297 los datos de ocupaci n hotelera ser n este verano entre 5 y 6 puntos porcentuales menores que los registrados el verano pasado

6703299 en lo que va de verano s lo se logr el cien por cien de ocupaci n en los hoteles de la costa el pasado s bado 16 pero el lunes se volvieron a registrar tasas de entre el 70 y el 80 seg n las zonas

6703301 im using a satellite thats orbiting the asteroid and the rotation of the asteroid itself to wrap this ribbon
6703302 so its kind of like it wraps as it rotates
6703303 what happens then is light from the sun shines on the body of the asteroid so more of it is reflected and it actually acts to move it away from the sun and the earth
6703304 its kind of like a very very bad day for earth
6703305 scientists say if it did impact the earth it would carry the force of 110 000 hiroshima bombs
6703306 at that time well probably be able to refine its orbit and determine how likely it is to hit the earth
6703307 if this one were to hit the earth you could say that most of life would be extinguished

6703322 in sbi its very essential that one takes a first call at a reasonable level which could be in my view at around rs 1200 or rs 1250 we have seen shares touching down to rs 1 000 level in the past but now i think in the recent scenario it could be rs 1200 to rs 1250 which could be an entry point even if you have to just prolong your investments maybe for a couple of months you are not able to make trading profits on the stock i dont think that one would be a looser having invested into the sbi at that level so taking a call in the present circumstances all the rate sensitive sectors in which predominantly auto real estate and the banking falls one could take a call at sbi at rs 1200 to rs 1250 for entering into the stock

6703337 literacy and numeracy improvement in primary schools is the departments number one priority
6703338 these results have shown some fantastic developments daily newspapers are stable and have reduced emphasis on pmie print media in education and third party bulks with healthy growth seen in typical blue collar titles
6703339 the decline of weekly titles were driven by losses suffered by larger titles but a concerning increase was seen in third party bulks mainly from mail amp guardian
6703340 weekend category appears stable but large titles are struggling to maintain their position but weekender and sunday sun are doing well
6703341 overall community press and free newspapers are stable with growth coming mainly from new titles
6703342 third party bulk circulation has continued to shrink and is down some 26
6703343 while many titles have shrunk there are those champions in each category that buck the trends these titles show the way forward and should inspire further innovation because it is clear that readers remain vital and responsive to a good read
6703344 it is clear that print has been through a tough time and in certain areas there are still a few hurdles ahead
6703345 while concerns over the economy are certainly valid reasons for some circulation declines it must also be said that some of the declines must be attributed to cutbacks as a result of growing input cost pressures
6703346 the introduction of greater accessibility to the data by decision makers will however ensure increased and more immediate market support

6703377 he is not here but he has risen remember how he spoke to you while he was still in galilee
6703378 what are these words that you are exchanging with one another as you are walking
6703379 are you the only one visiting jerusalem and unaware of the things which have happened here in these days
6703380 the things about jesus the nazarene who was a prophet mighty in deed and word in the sight of god and all the people
6703381 but we were hoping that it was he who was going to redeem israel indeed besides all this it is the third day since these things happened
6703382 but also some women among us amazed us when they were at the tomb early in the morning
6703383 some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just exactly as the women also had said but him they did not see
6703384 o foolish men and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken
6703385 was it not necessary for the christ to suffer these things and to enter into his glory
6703386 stay with us for it is getting toward evening and the day is now nearly over
6703387 were not our hearts burning within us while he was speaking to us on the road while he was explaining the scriptures to us

6703390 see my hands and my feet that it is i myself touch me and see for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that i have
6703391 these are my words which i spoke to you while i was still with you that all things which are written about me in the law of moses and the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled
6703392 thus it is written that the christ would suffer and rise again from the dead the third day

6703544 our partnership has been a natural coming together of non profit organisations with a similar vision
6703545 we would like to grow our relationship with the big issue we recognise that their market is similar to ours theyre trying to create a platform for sustainable growth for their vendors much in the same way that were trying to support our artists and the people we employ through our organisation and the festival
6703546 with 1000 people expected to attend the festival a day the out the box festival is a great opportunity for us to raise awareness of our brands it also means 1000 more people a day are likely to buy the big issue as our vendors will be selling magazines at the festival this is an exciting opportunity

6703549 you all have no idea what our day is going to be like
6703550 wow we have never seen a mom here this soon after birth
6703551 we are working on it random stuff without relevance trust me
6703552 we re doing something but i can t tell you what
6703553 the situation is looking increasingly dire due to technical reasons
6703554 established investors have been reaping the benefits of the housing downturn for some time
6703555 they will continue to do so in the short term however ever increasing supply could have an impact on rental growth as tenant options increase
6703556 new mortgage deals are being done but these are by the savvy landlords who have put money away to use as a cushion for these hard times
6703557 i only invested in an area i know very well rotherham in south yorkshire and chose to buy houses close to a very good comprehensive school which has attracted families as tenants who tend to stay longer
6703558 newer landlords are finding it difficult to finance buying property so competition is reduced
6703559 it isnt like other investments it is very hands on there will be ups as well as downs but you really have to be in it for the long term property investment is no longer a get rich quick scheme
6703560 i used to run my own business and didnt have a pension
6703561 the business collapsed and i had little money to show for it
6703562 i bought four properties and sold one on very quickly at a good profit
6703563 try and get as much information on the area and type of property you are looking to invest in
6703564 it is convincing people that rotherham is a place where they can go and live work and do business there is the same challenge in a lot of smaller towns
6703565 if youve got a location where youve got a second or third city such as leeds and bradford newcastle and sunderland and manchester and salford the question is should policy be to try to keep these places at the same level in the hierarchy
6703566 that is not always going to work historically bradford was once more important than leeds when the wool trade was flourishing but that has changed
6703567 the regeneration of an area is not just about house prices
6703568 in fact rising house prices which have traditionally been associated with regeneration may not be of benefit to local people who are still working on the same wages and may not be able to afford the new housing we have to look at the wider picture
6703569 the report employs a narrow definition of success focusing on the hard measures of economic regeneration
6703570 successful urban regeneration requires a more sophisticated mix of strengthening employment and skills development improvements in quality of life and community well being
6703571 the acid test is when a place develops a long term raison d tre it enjoys sustainable and varied employment physical improvements and social and economic benefits
6703572 you can already see physical regeneration happening all over the place there is centenary square in bradford a beacon in the city centre clarence dock in leeds which is starting to feel like a thriving area and the newcastle quayside but all have been around for only a decade or so and a decade is a short time in regeneration
6703573 we will have to take that into consideration because our assessment is on a weekly basis
6703574 demand for the greenback was strong in the market amid rising oil prices and falling stock prices intervention by foreign exchange authorities was not enough to turn the tide

6703585 there should be a level playing field its unfair to allow unrestricted internet telephony to isps at no additional cost
6703586 the government has been pushing reforms in telecoms i think theyll give it the green light
6703587 in other words an increase in the isps business will also result in a boom for existing telcos given this scenario the government would do well to accept the regulators recommendations

6703616 im using a satellite thats orbiting the asteroid and the rotation of the asteroid itself to wrap this ribbon
6703617 so its kind of like it wraps as it rotates
6703618 what happens then is light from the sun shines on the body of the asteroid so more of it is reflected and it actually acts to move it away from the sun and the earth
6703619 its kind of like a very very bad day for earth
6703620 scientists say if it did impact the earth it would carry the force of 110 000 hiroshima bombs
6703621 at that time well probably be able to refine its orbit and determine how likely it is to hit the earth
6703622 if this one were to hit the earth you could say that most of life would be extinguished

6703649 i couldve done it longer but i think sometimes you need to let others enjoy it and take that next step
6703650 the decision in my mind would be this is the right time im confident some of the issues were handling some of the directions were going are very positive

6703855 alles was wir brauchen sind stoppschilder und rotlichtampeln dann werden die verkehrsunf lle zur ckgehen
6703856 aber woher sollen wir das geld nehmen um stoppschilder aufzustellen wir haben doch alles geld f r die teflonbehandlung ausgegeben
6703857 und wie sollen wir berhaupt stoppen k nnen die strassen sind voll von teflon falls wir stoppschilder aufstellen w re alles geld das wir f r teflon ausgegeben haben zum fenster rausgeworfenes geld
6703858 die stoppschilder w rden die belagserneuerungen mit teflon berfl ssig machen und somit k nnten die autos in wenigen tagen auch wieder anhalten und die zahl der verkehrsunf lle n hme ab die l sung ist so einfach

6704128 hes there for that extra bit of guidance and any questions that we have that we might not be able to fix on our own
6704129 a lot of us are having the best years weve ever had in our career
6704130 hes been really helpful in teaching me how to pitch when its not working hes been helpful with my thought process
6704131 especially if you see something from the pitcher if you have a good read on him have a good feel for him every time you get on youre going to use it going to try to attempt it somewhat like hitting pitching you build momentum feel a little more comfortable i dont want to say comfortable but its just easier to read the more times youre on base

6704170 a lot of people who seek basic level skills have not achieved this in the school system before you know it they re in depravation a youth team leader at our charity will go on a course at level 2 and from an hr perspective this is providing the start of a career structure for youth workers
6704171 one of the main drivers for young people to join is to get skills which provide an access route into the nhs it provides them with a proper career path and focus its one part of the solution to getting young people off the streets
6704172 our youth wing is there to develop young people expanding the capacity of the youth service has wider societal objectives its a win win
6704173 to actually film there was an honor it was like being in a bollywood film
6704174 he represents youth he represents coming from behind represents talent he represents freshness and for nationwide insurance he was the perfect spokesperson to talk about retiring and planning for the future
6704175 nationwide insurance has leveraged celebrities a lot in the past what its done for us is given us some topicality and we found that a company that really has low unaided awareness has been able to generate a tremendous amount of talk value
6704176 pretty much from here on out its just so close were trying to win every game for the team if i clean up on decisions great but im just trying to go out and get deep into the game give us a chance to win
6704177 ive got a lot of confidence especially with the guys hitting out there and playing defense behind me the way they are
6704178 ive been able to get down in the zone low and get a lot of ground balls and strikeouts
6704179 he gets more people to chase pitches down in the zone so you just have to be really patient and really selective at what you swing at
6704180 are you concerned about the possible development of dry skin beneath eyes
6704181 damn this man really digs me and he gets me
6704182 coming into this poll i was frankly assuming that al franken was in trouble
6704183 hes had such a lousy string of damaging news reports
6704184 you couldnt image a candidate going through a worse time frankly if i was an oncologist and a patient presented this way i would say youre in trouble this could be fatal and indeed it looked really bad for franken and yet when we got the results of this poll it shows that franken and coleman are deadlocked
6704185 these angry voters are peeling off and supporting barkley and probably franken could be in the lead if he didnt have barkley in the race a big question is how does barkley do if he continues to gather steam its very hard to see how franken can win
6704186 i think theres a lot of mudslinging going around and you cant always know the truth and i need to know more before i can make a good decision
6704187 there are some warning signs in here for the franken campaign
6704188 the senate race is too much of throwing trash at each other i think
6704189 important issues the economy gas prices the iraq war afghanistan pakistan the decision is going to be based on who has the best answers to those questions i guess
6704190 when you ask voters who would do a better job on a variety of issues whether it be health care the economy and jobs ending the war in iraq franken does not have a discernable advantage on any of those issues
6704191 what youre seeing is that nationally voters think democrats do in fact have answers and would do a better job on these issues
6704192 chronically trying to be someone other than our original self persuaded that we are not adequate and should fit some norm of health or correctness we may find a cool distance gradually separating us from the deep and eternal person that god given personality and we may forget both who we were and who we might be
6704193 the soul has its own set of rules the events of the soul are cyclic and repetitive familiar themes come round and round the past is more important than the future the living and the dead have equal roles pleasures are deep and pain can reach the very foundations of our existence
6704194 the soul doesnt evolve or grow it cycles and twists repeats and reprises echoing ancient themes common to all human beings its odyssey is a drifting at sea a floating toward home not an evolution toward perfection
6704195 to be modern is to worship at the altar of health we look forward to the day when we will be fully balanced and adjusted we believe we will have arrived there when trouble vanishes and we feel chronically carefree behind this attitude lies a salvational fantasy once in a group discussion james hillman was celebrating the souls pathologies i supported his stance by saying how important it is to safeguard our symptoms a man in the group came up to me afterward and said did i hear you right did you speak in favor of preserving our symptoms how could a therapist of all people make such an odd remark our neuroses are the raw material out of which an interesting personality may be crafted they are sometimes dangerous and debilitating but nonetheless valuable not wallowing in our limitations by creatively dealing with them as resources for a vital life the prima materia of the alchemists we arrive not at shallow self acceptance but at profound love of the soul which with its rich mixture of the good and the bad is the starting point of a creative life

6704201 the volume claims to be not just another diet book and a look at the twisted conspiracy thats making our country fat the books marketing says it will focus on what many call proportion distortion how our plates and average serving sizes have increased over the past few decades to secretly forge a nation of fatties this idea and the motivation to stop the dinnerware expanding insanity seems to stand in sharp contrast to the agenda pushed by crispin porter amp bogusky on behalf of some of its clients

6704213 het betekent niet dat we de raad hebben afgeschreven juist in een tijd waarin de media onder vuur liggen en veel invloed wordt toegedicht is er een schone taak weggelegd voor een onafhankelijke arbiter die waakt over het journalistieke fatsoen maar dat stelt hoge eisen aan de arbiter n aan zijn uitspraken
6704214 the key task for policy makers going forward is to ensure that older people can increasingly play an active role in our ageing society
6704215 the days of assuming older people are dependants must now come to an end
6704216 an ageing society is a fact of life which should be welcomed and embraced not treated with concern
6704217 these figures provide a stark illustration of labours failure to manage our immigration system
6704218 there has been a complete change in the political mood in scotland
6704219 we have got rid of the labour dominated politics of urban central scotland with a more balanced scottish parliament where farming msps constitute the second largest group next to lawyers
6704220 however we have seen no evidence to justify support for independence although we would like to see the scottish government get more power if the referendum supports independence it will all depend on the deal we get from westminster if we get a crap deal it wont work
6704221 when i became minister the relationship between the government and the industry was dire
6704222 the minister with responsibility for agriculture spent most of his time at westminster and was hardly seen in scotland no strategy existed for scottish farming and farmers were struggling to survive
6704223 the vets set the programme at a 7am meeting every morning and the army got on with the job

6704226 we are always willing to enter into debate but we have no plans to go the gm route
6704227 we see no benefits for scotland more scrutiny is required of the claims made for gm it is a global issue
6704228 what happens in 10 years time if scotland is caught in the past using crops that require substantial chemical usage while the rest of the world has moved on

6704230 we are being isolated from the big policy decisions and have found ourselves in a bit of a time warp
6704231 marketing gurus create new terminology like ria and web 2 0 in order to force people to engage in new conversations without them dragging along their baggage of ingrained prejudices about what something is or is not

6704233 first because like all things techy its already obsolete and second because its limiting

6704287 i think for the most part they did that this year theres no secret there was a lot of money paid out in bonuses this year
6704288 obviously wed rather spend less than more thats part of what my job is but i think the real concern with the draft is when some clubs arent able to select the best player
6704289 the second issue is cost i cant say were thrilled with the escalation that has occurred in signing bonuses the last couple of years
6704290 believe me its a very bitter taste in our mouths when we lost out on pedro alvarez and what he became over three years at vanderbilt
6704291 thats when we went and took lars anderson we took matt laporta the central piece for the indians when they dealt cc sabathia to the brewers and couldnt get that done i think more and more teams have seen that which is why youve seen more clubs paying overslot bonuses teams i think are realizing that this is our opportunity to strengthen our organization
6704292 we work very hard each year to try to encourage the clubs to work within the slotting system
6704293 seventy something percent of the players sign at slot one solution is to work hard with the system we have now longer term i think a more concrete solution is going to be a product of collective bargaining we have had discussions with the players association in earlier rounds of collective bargaining we are constantly evaluating solutions
6704294 a signing at 6 million in the first round that happens on july 15 does a lot more damage than if it happens at 11 59 p m on aug 15 the deadline for signing draftees
6704295 i think the majority of the clubs just see whats happening at the major league level as far as free agents what theyre costing
6704296 everybodys already said we want to build from within but really putting your money where your mouth is its not just bonus payments its everything infrastructure the number of scouts you have with all the signs we saw this year the amount of money that was spent a number of teams believe in investing in their own system
6704297 sitting here today we felt like we got another first round player in the fifth round
6704298 time will only tell but the drafts purpose is to help strengthen our team the system probably isnt perfect we felt the talent alone was too good to see go to school and have it happen again another kid to vanderbilt and then taken at the top of the draft we werent going to let that happen again
6704299 an unsettling circular symbol which looks like an attempt to recreate the sign for satan

6704302 when we announced our decision to leave our current television series after seven years we were very touched by the number of people who told us how much they wanted to see us continuing making programmes together
6704303 in 1865 friedrich august kekul woke up from a strange dream he imagined a snake forming a circle and biting its own tail like many organic chemists of the time kekul had been working feverishly to describe the true chemical structure of benzene a problem that continually eluded understanding but kekul s dream of a snake swallowing its tail so the story goes helped him to accurately realize that benzenes structure formed a ring this insight paved the way for a new understanding of organic chemistry and earned kekul a title of nobility in germany although most of us have not been ennobled there is something undeniably familiar about kekul s problem solving method whether deciding to go to a particular college accept a challenging job offer or propose to a future spouse sleeping on it seems to provide the clarity we need to piece together lifes puzzles but how does slumber present us with answers

6704332 after range trading for the first four months of the year property stocks tracked the decline in financial stocks as growing worries about inflation interest rates and recession dogged the market
6704333 but the activity of short selling in the sector is at the root of the unprecedented volatility we are now seeing
6704334 the property sector as a whole is not very liquid especially in the small and mid cap names which are exposed to higher leverage or development
6704335 they have been the target of some aggressive and indiscriminate shorting in the long run such volatility is not a concern but it is certainly unsettling in the short term
6704336 share prices are likely to reflect capital market concerns rather than the fundamentals of tenant demand and security of income
6704337 it is fair to assume that pricing will overshoot on the downside just as it overshot on the way up
6704338 however one only knows where the bottom was in retrospect
6704339 it may turn out that july 15th 2008 was the low point but then we thought that january 10th was as well

6704348 i just wanted the tribe to say yes we recognize that you are just as important as any other tribe member and we will treat you and your spouse as we treat all tribal members
6704349 it can do anything good or anything bad to the tribes and the indian people as citizen indians
6704350 for our tribe we want people to walk in the shoes of other people and learn to respect differences
6704351 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6704352 they are working on a plan that looks lo and behold like the plan that ive been advocating i will encourage the administration to move forward with it
6704353 were monitoring closely and will have something to say when an agreement is finalized
6704354 at this point obama looks a little less reckless than he might have a few months ago
6704355 i dont think this gets the issue off the table
6704356 between now and election day not a lot of troops are going to come home
6704357 has made it clear he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq
6704358 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines
6704359 through relevant i reach a demographic that has strong faith morals and passion but disagreements politically
6704360 it wouldnt be wise for me to be seen as picking a political side when ive consistently said both sides are right in some areas and wrong in some areas
6704361 this generation of values voters doesnt necessarily need to draw political battle lines the way previous generations have and that we can work through areas of disagreement toward common goals
6704362 desire for change on earmarks and our commitment to get it done
6704363 funding will send your tax dollars back to be used in your neighborhood where it belongs
6704364 not every earmark is bad but my goodness they ought to pass the straight face test
6704365 even though it would be very beneficial politically its hard when a very substantial portion of the conference isnt on board
6704366 then of course came skyrocketing gas prices and the opportunity to draw a real contrast on drilling

6704391 absence of positive emotional displays is a major feature of his facial expressions
6704392 non verbal communication is more important than verbal communication in gaining the trust of an audience this research shows that while obamas verbal communication is excellent his non verbal communication skills particularly his facial expressions need work in terms of public speaking he already has a lead on john mccain but he needs to expand his range of facial expressions to become a great orator
6704393 skillfully chunks the information into sense groups allowing for easy comprehension of his messages
6704394 voice does not reflect the emotional nature of each topic
6704395 facial repertory is limited to a recurrent pattern combining the expressions of sadness anger and disgust

6704403 multiple failed applications can be time consuming and of course can be detrimental to a borrower
6704404 with criteria changing regularly and the risk of decline increasing all the time it is even more important that borrowers looking to obtain a mortgage use reputable mortgage professionals with broad experience knowledge and systems at their disposal which will increase the chances of the borrower getting the deal they need

6704419 our long term growth platform is focused on corn soybeans cotton and vegetables repositioning the business would ensure that loyal dairy farmers could continue to receive the value of posilac in their operations
6704420 our core focus is in the seeds and trace business since 1994 its posilac been a very strong product for us weve sold more doses this year than we sold last year we see significant opportunity in the future in the u s as well as the international markets
6704421 may pass into humans through milk air water or soil or through ground meat
6704422 as the environmental pressure on agriculture gets greater this allows dairy producers to produce more milk with less sic cows thereby reducing the overall carbon footprint of milk production
6704423 like gastroesophageal reflux and bipolar disease osteopenia began to inflict millions when a drug to treat it was patented
6704424 global dairy demand is increasing outstripping supply and consumers are seeing rapidly rising prices
6704425 with the purchase of posilac elanco can enhance its overall product portfolio and work together with the industry to provide dairy farmers more options and give consumers affordable choices
6704426 with our rich history and experience in the dairy industry elanco is the ideal steward of this vital technology
6704427 elanco remains committed to using science to address the growing need for safe affordable food and to choices for consumers retailers and producers
6704428 as a governing body we will be judged by the access we provide to the grassroots
6704429 these courses are a great way of sampling whats involved and building your confidence before you do the more practical stuff
6704430 football coaching must move with the times and governing bodies such as the fa must enable students to access courses in the easiest and most appropriate format for many that is the internet
6704431 if youre going to do coaching you want to do it to the best of your ability and this includes learning about the game
6704432 in the modern world many people are pushed for time and find it very difficult to actually attend a course
6704433 working online if youve got half an hour here or an hour there you can dip in and out of it over a six month period and become a very improved coach

6704437 with rising unemployment and negative real wage growth being intensified by the latest hike in utility bills our technical recession view is looking more plausible
6704438 we believe that the bank will be more aggressive in its easing policy with rates down to 3 50 by the second half of 2009
6704439 this highlights two growing trends within the region one being a growing interest in advertising plays that capitalize on indias emerging infrastructure and growing internet usage the other being an increase in second round deals which is expected as vcs are helping their portfolio companies expand and steering them toward liquidity
6704440 while the size of venture deals in the u s europe and even china continues to climb venture capitalists have shown some restraint in terms of investments in india due largely to the risk still associated with this emerging region in fact since we began tracking venture investment in india the median deal size has dropped from 17 million in 2005 to 10 million in 2006 and now to 8 million in the first six months of 2008
6704441 where do you draw a line of what we are going to cover and what we are not going to cover
6704442 are we going to cover the airline tickets are we going to cover the ho tels are we going to cover extended long stays like the double lung trans plant recipient
6704443 we need to really look at that and really have an idea what kind of costs and what other programs we are going to maybe have to put on hold to cover it
6704444 its a tough decision its not some thing weve ever done nor is it some thing any other province does except newfoundland
6704445 i know that theres a genuine desire to improve the services provided to those who require lung transplant my belief is that together were going to find a way to make some positive steps forward
6704446 if physicians are suspicious were going to be asking them to make sure they test and the test is to do a stool sample
6704447 we typically see an average of five listeria cases year
6704448 to date weve had one which was a couple of weeks ago but we know from some of the laboratory testing its a different strain so its not related to the outbreak
6704449 one of the real concerns is in pregnant women it can cause miscarriages if theyre in the first trimester
6704450 in general to protect against listeria and other food borne illness its just good food handling
6704451 keeping cold foods refrigerated hot foods making sure theyre cooked properly and ensuring good sanitation in the kitchen
6704452 certainly the more we turn to local products in this province the more we dont have to be concerned about imports
6704453 our food services group tells me we didnt have any of the recalled products for our in patient foods

6704487 the new policy is the result of an extremely successful collaboration of clinical experts nhs managers and patients that will ensure a much fairer approach across the region

6704489 the treatment involves a complex programme that can take up to a year and it is important that there are limitations where there may be clinical or other risks

6704513 das war f r uns eine einmalige erfahrung und ein ganz gro er augenblick f r den afrikanischen fussball
6704514 ich kann mich noch daran erinnern dass die anderen sportler uns komisch ansahen und sich ganz offensichtlich fragten was wir da eigentlich veranstalteten als wir im olympischen dorf sangen tanzten und parties feierten wir hatten schon einige starke charaktere in der mannschaft aber gleichzeitig auch viel freundschaft und gegenseitigen respekt
6704515 ich kann ihnen sagen dass dieses tor damals der gl cklichste augenblick meiner karriere war
6704516 alle hatten sich schon auf eine verl ngerung eingestellt aber mit diesem tor war dann alles gelaufen das war ein unglaubliches gef hl freude pur und die feiern danach waren fast so toll wie das tor selbst
6704517 nat rlich ist die silbermedaille auch ein gro er erfolg aber wir hatten w hrend des gesamten turnierverlaufs sehr gut gespielt und einfach mehr verdient
6704518 aber die nigerianische mannschaft war gro artig und man kann ihre leistung keinesfalls schm lern
6704519 man kann unser team 1996 nicht mit der aktuellen mannschaft von samson siasia vergleichen aber sie sind schon sehr talentiert
6704520 das olympische fussballturnier zu gewinnen ist ein gro artiges und pr gendes erlebnis ich hoffe die partie am samstag geht genauso aus wie die von 1996

6704533 somalia has no central government we are worried that more may join the pirates to hijack ships because its very lucrative and there is no deterrent
6704534 the united nations is the only agency that can stop this menace the international community has to agree to find ways to solve this worsening problem that is the only way forward
6704535 since the prisoner khodorkovsky had no connection with the professional educational program offered him in detention he does not deserve conditional early release
6704536 the obama desire to get out and the mccain desire to succeed could be coming together in the form of an ability to get out while succeeding
6704537 the simple truth is that we do not have sufficient forces in iraq to meet our military objectives

6704549 wholly in line with methods some chinese have been using to distort and fabricate stories about korea
6704550 a large number of them moved to the east coast and settled in present day baltimore maryland the phelps are maryland natives and therefore there is a big possibility that the phelps are of korean lineage doesnt that explain how a swimming genius came into being in inland maryland he has blood of koreans who came to america by crossing the pacific running in his veins
6704551 chinese media apparently aim to spread a negative image of koreans as a people who shamelessly distort history thus indirectly lending credence to chinese attempts to co opt early korean history

6704563 the sponsors are trying to determine their efficacy and safety on children and adolescents
6704564 is hypertension in this age group 1 16 years a problem in india if yes what is the incidence and prevalence if it is not a major problem why conduct a trial in india and put children at risk without any benefit
6704565 if the company has not applied for marketing approval to use the drug on children why were phase iii trials permitted
6704566 why should foreign companies conduct phase iii studies in india when they have not applied for marketing
6704567 even if the trials establish the safety and efficacy of these molecules in children the sponsors would not commercially benefit because of lack of patent
6704568 it is obvious that these trials are being conducted to extend patent period in western countries with no consequence or benefit for india using indian children as guinea pigs

6704572 we are utterly resolute in our determination to support this new democracy of afghanistan
6704573 we wont relax our efforts to support and reconstruct afghanistan because we understand that what happens in afghanistan affects the rest of the world we are determined to work with the government and coalition forces to defeat the forces of terrorism
6704574 we have succeeded in winning back territory the longer term solution is that more power will be given to the afghanistan people
6704575 you are the heroes of our country you are the frontline against the taliban what you are doing here prevents terrorism coming to the streets of britain
6704576 this week we are celebrating the olympics where we have had great success people have been winning medals in areas where we have been breaking ground but this week also i believe that our olympic athletes and everybody else in our country will remember that you have showed exactly the same courage professionalism and dedication you make our country proud every day of the week every week of the year

6704584 theyre staggering numbers and really speak to some new implications for the way we think about suicide prevention
6704585 its not enough to just look for the students who may be at any given time experiencing a suicidal crisis we need to be investing in promoting and bolstering the mental health of the entire student community
6704586 what is alarming is that suicide is a very preventable public health issue
6704587 our goal really would be to raise money to give it away
6704588 to give to the best and brightest projects that could have the biggest impact on reducing the burden of disease of trauma
6704589 its just the nature of what we do and i actually think its probably good that people dont associate themselves as trauma victims they think they were hurt and they got better
6704590 but that probably does explain if you were to just look at the nih list of institutes gosh we have an institute for those problems but we dont have an institute for trauma which is the leading cause of death in children which old people die like crazy from and is the main reason why our troops are dying in afghanistan and iraq
6704591 when people ask us are you taking advantage of the fact that theres a war we answer very affirmatively yes we are
6704592 wars bring advances in medical technology and we need to make something good come out of all of that
6704593 a common question people would ask whether it was policymakers or citizens or even families of the wounded was what can we do to help
6704594 the obvious answer was we could improve funding for trauma research
6704595 trauma care is developing its national voice in s a
6704596 ensure that greater road funding levels are maintained through the fall and spring until we can work with other elected officials to provide additional solutions
6704597 so someone else is going to come up 1 billion short
6704598 its just another indicator that we dont have a revenue system that can produce the money we need to provide the services we need
6704599 trs needs to make those decisions exclusively on the same basis they make any other investment decisions the fact that the person who appointed them might have a preference really shouldnt matter to them
6704600 is a start but forming a corporation and using public employees pension funds to fund risky toll projects the private sector is beginning to shy away from borders on malfeasance

6704679 in conclusion the results of this large randomized multicenter study demonstrated that the silver coated endotracheal tube significantly reduced the incidence of microbiologically confirmed ventilator associated pneumonia and had its greatest benefit during the peak time of ventilator associated pneumonia occurrence without any notable adverse events

6704684 he loved his job santa rosa used to be family everybody who worked there was family everyone took care of each other

6704697 this regulation is not about contraception its about abortion and conscience
6704698 this lack of knowledge of provider conscience law within the health professions can be detrimental to conscience and other rights particularly for individuals and entities with moral objections to abortion and other medical procedures
6704699 the proposed regulations and secretary leavitts public comments about them leave the door open as to whether institutions and individuals can deny access to contraception
6704700 while the rules are not identical to the draft proposal being circulated by hhs last month the agency interprets existing conscientious objection laws so broadly that it could result in women not receiving information they need to make informed healthcare decisions
6704701 it undermines the doctor patient relationship because women will now have to question whether their health care providers are giving them complete and unbiased information and the best care possible
6704702 t he issue i asked to be addressed in this regulation is not abortion or contraceptives but the legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience and patients should be able to choose a doctor who has beliefs like his or hers the department is still contemplating if it will issue a regulation or not if it does it will be directly focused on the protection of practitioner conscience
6704703 is the fear here that so many doctors will refuse that it will somehow make it difficult for a woman to get an abortion that hasnt happened but what if it did wouldnt that be an important and legitimate social statement

6704735 he is a young man but he should show more respect for his rivals that would be more in the spirit of the olympic ideal
6704736 he should shake hands with them after the finish line however he is only 21 and he will learn it would be good not to have a repeat of the catch me if you can gesture

6704781 the buyout was there depending on what the political atmosphere was like
6704782 what was brought out in the grand jurys findings was so detrimental in bexarmet being able to do its business there had to be a separation of ways
6704783 if we had voted to have a buyout i would have been spending the next two or three weeks explaining my decision to homeowner groups
6704784 i wanted to bring this out in the open so that those people who might talk for a buyout back in the back room would have to do it out in the open

6704834 i do have a spider man that looks like spider man
6704835 these people have always used figures of personalities from movies and television without any problem

6704851 estaba tan instalada la idea de que el empleo hab a ca do que los resultados me sorprendieron
6704852 estamos viendo lo mismo que los a os anteriores s lo que las variaciones ahora son menos marcadas
6704853 cuando el desempleo estaba en 24 por ciento la recuperaci n era de 2 o 3 puntos porcentuales por semestre ahora es de 0 4 o 0 5 por ciento
6704854 lo importante en esta etapa es mejorar la calidad del trabajo
6704855 durante la convertibilidad se llegaron a crear un mill n de empleos formales pero el resultado neto del per odo fue cercano a cero porque los puestos que se ganaron en un momento se perdieron en otro
6704856 el lockout del sector agropecuario no afect la creaci n de puestos de trabajo formales como se hab a temido
6704857 solicitar al gobierno que abra la mesa de negociaci n
6704858 el paro de 48 horas se ha iniciado con un muy alto grado de acatamiento
6704859 lucha por el salario el aumento del 30 por ciento de emergencia y la exigencia de adelanto de los aumentos correspondientes a agosto y diciembre
6704860 el desajuste inflacionario impacta directamente sobre los salarios de los trabajadores resultado del lockout patronal del campo
6704861 el objetivo de la resoluci n es desalentar el uso de los salones en el caso de que se pida ser para asociaciones sin fines de lucro
6704862 actividades culturales de divulgaci n cient fica incluyendo proyecciones o exposiciones
6704863 cuando el fin sea comercial o de ndole pol tico partidaria

6704875 the car is good and the team has done a great job to give us a great car right out of the box
6704876 now we can use the precious track time to learn more about the car we havent won this year but everyone seems to lose the fact that we came out with a brand new car weve shown that were fast enough to win but its a brand new car and we havent been to any of these tracks with it before i think were ready to win
6704877 i think the team is doing a very good job this year
6704878 we start pretty well and we have always improved the car the team is keeping on pushing the development work so i am confident that before the end of the season we can do some good results
6704879 there are some circumstances and some circuits where we are extremely competitive like it was in hungary and magny cours and some others where maybe we suffer a bit more but nevertheless i think we will always fight for top ten in qualifying and our aim is always to score points at every race obviously our target will be finishing fourth in the constructors championship
6704880 there are a lot of lessons to learn from vietnam which successfully attracts promising foreign investments there are mongolian students studying in vietnam in the future attach attention on specifying academic majors

6704886 el problema lleva 13 a os y comenz cuando el vaticano empez a hacerme algunas observaciones por art culos period sticos que hab a publicado me dijeron que yo hac a apreciaciones err neas como negar la existencia hist rica de ad n y eva las apariciones f sicas de la virgen mar a y la existencia del ngel que convers con mar a al que consider un g nero literario
6704887 yo creo en la doctrina de la iglesia y es una paradoja lo que me han hecho a m la iglesia ense a que los primeros cap tulos de la biblia no son hechos hist ricos son relatos para transmitir ense anzas el para so terrenal nunca existi la v bora nunca habl con ad n y eva y ellos no existieron me ense aron y ahora no me dejan ense ar ese conocimiento
6704888 los estudios b blicos han avanzado mucho hoy se sabe que el arca de no nunca existi que es un cuento para hablar de la justicia divina
6704889 yo voy a acatar la decisi n de la iglesia no voy a dar m s charlas me retirar de la docencia y solamente celebrar los sacramentos en santiago del estero
6704890 muchos de estos conocimientos no llegan a la gente porque quedan encerrados en libros t cnicos de la iglesia
6704891 el vaticano me oblig a retractarme en otras oportunidades y ahora me sancion con esta medida por la que no puedo ense ar
6704892 millones de argentinos utilizan a diario los servicios p blicos sin saber que les pertenecen
6704893 los pasajeros terminaron enfrentando los trenes creyendo que no son suyos
6704894 no puede ser que el estado est subsidiando el tren para que viajemos de esta manera

6704909 los combates son cada vez m s dif ciles porque los talib n son capaces de poner en pr ctica t cticas mucho m s aguerridas que antes
6704910 cuando los norteamericanos derrocaron el r gimen los talib n se esfumaron pero a ra z de los bombardeos que la mayor parte de las veces causaron p rdidas civiles los talib n volvieron a conquistar a la poblaci n la gente no los ayuda pero cierra los ojos
6704911 no es posible ganar militarmente esta guerra pero tampoco es posible irse y dejar a afganist n en el caos
6704912 la administraci n bush explica olivier roy considera a los talib n como un movimiento exclusivamente terrorista aqu se ve el obst culo creado por la administraci n bush con la ideologizaci n de la guerra contra el terrorismo sin embargo esa negociaci n con un sector de los talib n representa la nica salida
6704913 hay que discutir una mayor asignaci n presupuestaria para el sistema universitario y replantear la distribuci n interna en la uba
6704914 venimos planteando la crisis presupuestaria desde hace tiempo todos los a os la facultad crece en matr cula estudiantil en los ltimos dos aument un 4 por ciento en la actualidad tenemos 28 400 alumnos cursando y a este incremento hay que acompa arlo con la designaci n de docentes
6704915 al menos la mitad est n subrentados es decir perciben un ingreso menor al correspondiente al trabajo que realizan
6704916 el consejo superior rechaz 200 cargos y neg nombramientos en la fadu pero no tienen problemas en intervenir en temas como las elecciones jurados o concursos
6704917 hay 1200 docentes que est n en la misma situaci n que yo soy jefe de trabajos pr cticos pero cobro como ayudante de segunda
6704918 clases p blicas y asambleas paro activo de los docentes hasta la resoluci n de los problemas planteados
6704919 el problema presupuestario iba a estallar en alg n momento pero todos cre amos que iba a salir m s por el lado del hospital de cl nicas finalmente la fadu expres primero las dificultades y seguramente esto seguir explotando poco a poco a medida que avance el cuatrimestre y los fondos sean cada vez menos
6704920 a trav s de una redistribuci n presupuestaria interna en la facultad se logr abonar el salario de 320 nuevos docentes hasta el 30 de septiembre incluido
6704921 a los docentes del curso de verano se les adelant un dinero de los recursos propios pero definitivamente es la uba la que tiene que hacerse cargo
6704922 algunos cargos al momento de asumir en la facultad no hab a secretar a de extensi n por dar s lo un ejemplo por lo que se crearon cargos la situaci n nos obliga a recortar algunas reas y hacerlas funcionar al m nimo pero nuestro objetivo principal es mantener la actividad docente
6704923 si bien ten amos que luchar contra la subversi n no ten amos capacidad para hacerlo porque est bamos preocupados por la guerra con chile

6704958 bluefield has always been the first game but as far as who we play first im just ready to strap it on and go to be honest with you
6704959 if bluefield is not first thats fine with me right now our focus is christiansburg and right now thats what were planning on
6704960 weve not done it since 85 so i guess in that respect it is strange but a game is a game
6704961 id like to open with them but theres nothing we can do about it so were not worried
6704962 it is different its always really fun to start out with a really great team like that because we know they are very competitive and they are one of the best teams in the state of west virginia

6704970 we actually have one of the later starts when you look at our neighbors
6704971 i think our teachers and students and parents and everyone seemed to think we had a very good first day of school
6704972 so we are looking forward to the school year its just good to be back we like our schools when weve got children with us that is what we are all about
6704973 he was a wise compassionate man who always maintained a boyish enthusiasm for life his family and his friends
6704974 i have often thought that i didnt know tom sawyer but i knew homer ball and i think that of the two i was most honored to know homer
6704975 homer did our entire walk for scholarships in 1988 and he and his wife helen were the trail bosses for our second walk for scholarships in 1992
6704976 the funds we raised in those walks and the annual homer ball golf tournament are the basis of our scholarship endowment
6704977 homer really always had the best interests of students at heart especially for students from families of modest means
6704978 i wish the words i could say at this moment could somehow be equal to the man homer ball was homer was a friend of our family a friend of concord university and a friend to this entire community there are no words to express impact that homer has had on all of our lives
6704979 homer was a dear friend to sharon and me and hes someone who dedicated his entire life to his community
6704980 his work in the legislature and throughout the region and particularly his life long commitment to mercer county and concord university has benefited thousands of people
6704981 the scholarship founded in his name at concord has afforded students from all walks of life the opportunity to enjoy the success that can be provided by a college education homer will truly be missed by many he was one of a kind our prayers are with his wife helen their children and grandchildren
6704982 homer and i were boyhood friends and were kids together in school in athens growing up
6704983 homer loved concord and when i was serving in the later years of my presidency i hired him to run the physical plant and he did an exceptional job when homer was in the senate he got the funds to do the research that enabled concord to become a university
6704984 i just thought of him as a great public servant
6704985 he did so much for people during his time in the house of delegates as well as in the senate he is certainly going to be missed
6704986 he was a tireless worker for this area and for the region while he was in the state legislature he was a good friend and will be dearly missed i feel a personal loss and my heart goes out to his family
6704987 we knew each other for 50 years homer and my brother graduated from athens high school together in 1942 homer was a good person who did a lot for this county
6704988 he was smart very likable and had a great sense of humor he was truly one of the most devoted citizens i have ever met i dont think many people are aware of the work he did for pipestem and for concord university
6704989 the phone rang it was homer and i said yes
6704990 he would steer us away from chasing all the small fires and keep us focused on the issues we needed to address for our long term benefit he was a friend and im going to miss him

6705040 the united states has consistently counseled georgia over a long period of time that there is no military solution in south ossetia
6705041 including the day before georgian troops went into south ossetia we said dont do it dont be drawn into a military conflict its not in your interest
6705042 but the pressure on georgia was too great and they felt they had to act and that gave russia the excuse they were looking for to launch a massive military operation with over 20 000 troops
6705043 its easy to see the careful preparation and the deliberate pressure put on georgia to which they responded unwisely
6705044 hey youngster i got a favor to ask you i need you to watch my back today going to chow

6705048 while we have tracked the fortunes of a few high profile royals like the queen of england and sultan of brunei for years this is only the second time we have published a definitive list of the richest royals
6705049 monarchs of such countries as spain and japan failed to make the cut
6705050 we are studying a number of options and are open to all possibilities which could include buying lehman
6705051 financially kdb will not have a problem buying a majority stake in lehman as the u s banks market cap has fallen sharply over the months
6705052 the problems however are legal and regulatory issues i am not so sure if the u s government will easily allow a foreign bank to purchase a significant stake in one of its key financial institutions
6705053 georgia has no other choice people have understood that if it is georgia today attacked by russian forces then tomorrow it could be poland or the czech republic
6705054 georgia was a russian colony for more than 200 years but this is the 21st century the time for colonies is over georgia now has the strong support of the outside world
6705055 the lands of south ossetia and abkhazia are our georgian land the demands of our people for their return are legitimate
6705056 i appeal to russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister vladimir putin to immediately end the occupation of georgia and to take their forces off its territory

6705061 they reviewed the documentation he submitted and we are not going to reinstate him
6705062 the conclusion of the exam is he couldnt tolerate an eight hour workday
6705063 particularly given his physique it is almost inconceivable that he could have a body like that and not bend and lift weights
6705064 the board isnt there to substitute its judgment for that of the appointing authority
6705065 if youve got an appointing authority saying if you can bodybuild you can be a fire inspector thats where the fights going to be
6705066 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6705067 they are working on a plan that looks lo and behold like the plan that ive been advocating i will encourage the administration to move forward with it
6705068 were monitoring closely and will have something to say when an agreement is finalized
6705069 at this point obama looks a little less reckless than he might have a few months ago
6705070 i dont think this gets the issue off the table
6705071 between now and election day not a lot of troops are going to come home
6705072 has made it clear he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq
6705073 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines
6705074 israel will continue with the talks and the fifth round of negotiations is scheduled to begin soon
6705075 we strongly oppose such a move and prime minister ehud olmertmade this abundantly clear during his phone conversation with russian president dmitry medvedev wednesday
6705076 a deal the pm was able to thwart during his meeting last october with then russian president vladimir putin
6705077 the major question related to this company at the moment is why isnt anything happening
6705078 we anticipate that lehman can absorb over 3 billion of after tax losses without adding more common equity
6705079 conducting a pre planned routine visit to the black sea region to interact and exercise with our nato partners romania and bulgaria which is an important feature of our routine planning
6705080 the new policy is the result of an extremely successful collaboration of clinical experts nhs managers and patients that will ensure a much fairer approach across the region
6705081 we are potentially offering a big improvement in the lives of many couples in the region where ivf is clinically the right solution and has the potential to succeed
6705082 the treatment involves a complex programme that can take up to a year and it is important that there are limitations where there may be clinical or other risks
6705083 part of the treatment involves specialist counselling so that couples have all the information and support that they need
6705084 before every big tournament fans expect a lot of big things from players and the players desperately want to give them something to be happy about hopefully that can come soon
6705085 we always have a point to prove we believe we have the players to do well in these major tournaments
6705086 we have not done so in the past few years but hopefully this can change for us and we can do well
6705087 we have to take on andorra first hopefully get the three points and then go on to croatia all the players cannot wait for the croatia game after what they did to us we cant wait to get over there and beat them
6705088 if you look at his record as a manager you are going to listen to the things he tells you and try to take them onto the pitch
6705089 we are playing slightly differently with a different formation we can still learn and do better
6705090 wir waren so souver n und sind so vorneweg geprescht das war ja der hammer

6705096 rundum schlechte nachricht f r den wirtschafts und besch ftigungsstandort m nster
6705097 selbst wenn dieser schritt des unternehmens rein betriebswirtschaftlich betrachtet sinnvoll sein mag und auch f r die strukturschwache emscher lippe region besch ftigungspolitisch zweifellos eine st rkung bedeutet so ist m nster als leistungsstarkes zentrum f r dienstleistungen doch der falsche hebel um unternehmerische oder regionale verlagerungseffekte zu erzielen
6705098 besonders bedr ckend f r mich ist die situation der betroffenen mitarbeiterinnen und mitarbeiter hier in m nster nach den telekom pl nen verlieren sie zwar nicht v llig ihren job m ssen aber trotz famili rer bindungen und verpflichtungen in m nster und im m nsterland zum erhalt ihres arbeitsplatzes t glich weite wege in kauf nehmen
6705099 eine der wichtigsten aufgaben der stadtpolitik als standortpolitik f r m nster immer wieder intensiv unternehmerische entscheidungen pro m nster zu unterst tzen und eine wirtschaftsf rderungspolitik zu betreiben die solche einschnitte verkraftet ohne dass auf mittlere sicht chronische strukturprobleme auf dem rtlichen arbeitsmarkt entstehen

6705106 entweder stirbt man als held oder lebt so lange bis man selbst zum schurken wird
6705107 the team has been showing signs of distinct improvement and better bonding with every subsequent match played it shows that the bench led by coach samson siasia possesses very good tactical command of the team and reads the opponents very well that has translated to the dream team playing better than the last match
6705108 twelve years ago our 4 3 semi final win boosted our moral going into the final against argentina in beijing the teams 4 1 win over belgium in the semis and their earlier defeat of cote divoire would have done their moral a world of good
6705109 they argentine friends are very confident that their team will win tomorrow but my reply to them has been that in football anything is possible
6705110 luckily they have a coach siasia who knows them argentina very well having played against them siasia scored against the south americans in the 2 1 usa94 defeat and coached he watched from the sidelines as his side lost 2 1 in holland
6705111 so he should know what to do if were him though i wouldnt man mark messi because he will definitely get protection from the referee which could result in penalties rather i would suggest trying to cut him messi off so that he doesnt get a steady supply of the ball with which he can do any damage
6705112 in atlanta bonfere tried as much as possible to stop the officials from distracting us before the final this will help siasia too it is a common practice for them officials to want to identify with the team now that they are doing well but more often than not it just increases the pressure on we the players this is one problem that is militating against african football because everybody wants to identify with success of the team
6705113 argentina is a very good side no doubt but in football anything is possible as were fearing them because of messi so are they fearing us to they know that were a very unpredictable side so they wont know what to expect
6705114 my major fear is them being over confident if they are able to remain focused and not harbour any fear complexion that they are meeting argentina then i believe they have a very good chance of winning
6705115 its very tough to focus on it right now with two pilots on my plate but as soon as i have any free time thats my top priority
6705116 weve played most of them before and we know what to do and what not do to get victory
6705117 at the world youth championships in holland in 2005 they got two penalties because my defenders were naive and easily fell for their tricks but its different now we have a more experienced and matured side its time to pay argentina back in their own coins
6705118 definitely we have to be at our best to stop players like lionel messi and mascherano
6705119 the argentines should also be worried about this team we have fast strikers and there is no way they can stop us
6705120 well do our best to stop them they wont have it easy without free kicks or penalties and that is a message for us
6705121 im looking forward to scoring against them again but the important thing is for the team to win
6705122 wir leben wie obdachlose und die leben wie k nige
6705123 mit der bev lkerung dort wird es keine probleme geben wenn erstmal die russen weg sind

6705139 and he said he had never seen anything like this in his life
6705140 ive been doing this for 30 years and i have never heard of anything like this happening im not sure if one seed split or if two seeds just stayed together
6705141 its not for me to talk about names now but theres three or four boys who have pulled up pretty shabbily from the game last week
6705142 yeah one guy might have developed op osteitis pubis out of the game
6705143 weve done about 30 per cent more recovery this week than for any other game just from how they pulled up from the match
6705144 i think theres some serious clubs out there that think they would like to have another crack at geelong and they think they can beat us
6705145 and deep down i think north melbourne is one of them i think they have a genuine opinion that on their day they can beat geelong
6705146 facial transplantation could be successful in the short term but the procedure was not without complications however promising results could mean that this procedure might be an option for long term restoration of severe facial disfigurement

6705180 hes like a second father to me all the shit hes been getting is unfair
6705181 its something weve worked on during the last couple of years we dont fear anybody now but i do find the timing of it unbelievable
6705182 i dont know what their agenda is but now is not the right time
6705183 its been a difficult couple of days for me personally but ive tried to shield my boxers weve come here to do a job and thats what were doing
6705184 i listened properly i could see everything coming him attacking me the way he did made me look good
6705185 i told you my skills would pay the bills i was dreaming of an olympic final four weeks ago now its happening everything is lovely
6705186 but right now the weight is perfect my head is perfect and im the man
6705187 alles samen vijfentachtig een aantal onder hen zag het niet zitten luc trouwens eerst ook niet maar hij was onze ideale gordon ramsay de kok van de britse serie waarop ons programma gebaseerd is hij zit vol vuur hij gaat ervoor hij weet wat de geslabakte restaurants moeten doen om er bovenop te komen hij is er ook echt mee begaan hij heeft veel meer gedaan dan we hem vroegen ook al had hij weinig tijd
6705188 we hebben gedraaid op dagen dat mijn eigen restaurant aan tafel bij luc bellings gesloten is zaterdag zondag en maandag dat zijn de dagen dat ik normaal ga fietsen mijn conditie heeft er dus bij ingeschoten het gevolg is dat mijn vrouw me intussen voorbijfietst
6705189 het format trok me aan ikzelf ben ook ooit mijn ster kwijtgeraakt omdat ik mijn motor op ralenti had laten draaien ik heb ze teruggewonnen en nu ga ik voor twee sterren
6705190 gebrek aan motivatie was zowat overal het onderliggende probleem het komt er voor mij dan op aan hen opnieuw te motiveren je kunt het vergelijken met sport als de sfeer in de ploeg niet goed is dan bereik je geen resultaten
6705191 je hebt in alles voor en tegenstanders in onze sector heerst natuurlijk ook jaloezie waarom heeft hij een ster en ik niet we hebben geen restaurants uitgekozen die te dichtbij gelegen zijn het dichtstbij is er een van diest voor mij was de voorwaarde vooral dat ik zelf in verbetering geloofde soms zat het probleem in communicatie twee eigenaren die elkaar rauw lustten in een ander geval lagen de echtscheidingspapieren al klaar dan schenkt het toch voldoening als je ze achteraf weer ziet kussen als je weggaat in n case was er een vrouwelijke chef en ik heb ook een restaurant bezocht waarvan de chef helemaal niet kon koken
6705192 ik kan nu al niet meer in korte broek in de binnenstad van hasselt rondlopen binnenkort kan ik dat ook in knokke niet meer ik hoor dat peter goossens het jurylid van mijn restaurant nu door de mensen van michelin geviseerd wordt omdat ze vermoeden dat hij door zijn tv werk minder in zijn restaurant staat het zijn allemaal risicos daarom heb ik tegen de productie gezegd alles wat je wilt maar ik moet hier wel in mijn zaak zijn
6705193 it went very well although we would have been happier if one or two more people had come along
6705194 they introduced me to concept of the business music partnership promised me nothing and delivered everything
6705195 within four weeks the funding and support was organised and i was in the studio recording my debut solo album
6705196 during my ten years in london i have made a decent living as a professional musician and that was good enough for me i have also met a lot of fairly flaky music industry people most of whom have promised the earth but delivered little and none who i could trust with my music
6705197 its fairly ironic that it was during a visit to see my dad who still lives on the island that i was introduced to iow music by an old friend i had never heard of them and to be honest i was fairly sceptical they seemed to be keeping a fairly low profile that in the music business is frankly unheard of
6705198 i suddenly realised it was three weeks to go until the big day and i looked in my spam e mail folder and all of these great bands and djs were sitting there waiting to be announced to say we are spoiled for choice at bestival this year is a slight understatement
6705199 it felt really slow for me then i hit the hills at st helens and remembered why i hadnt done this for a while
6705200 i like to take part in ryde harriers races as they are always brilliant fun
6705201 this was quite a tough race it undulated all the way now i am quite familiar with the island i have a much better idea of how far i have to go i much prefer off road racing but this was great
6705202 i know i am better than this but if my long jump and javelin had been better it might have been different im pleased to score higher than i did last year at the worlds and im not one to give up and i know i have more to give
6705203 im lost for words it is such a relief our experience was everything we stayed sure and we got better

6705246 its going to come back its just going to take some time they still need to keep training thats what we would tell them still keep playing the sport is at its highest you saw the best games of softball being played and thats all you can ask and hopefully that we get it back for those young kids who are looking to be where were at in every country everyone was watching i just think its going to get better
6705247 ive told some of the young ones that they have to play until 2016 so they can bring back the gold medal

6705361 from a car i actually live about 15 minutes from my job and it takes about 40 minutes on marta to get to my job so its a big difference
6705362 in the morning i promise you every train i am on something always happens where we have to transfer trains or we have to wait on another train
6705363 it was kind of crazy and we had to wait like five or 10 minutes for another train
6705364 there arent enough trains and they dont go to enough areas of the city
6705365 public safety and giving our passengers a safe and enjoyable ride
6705366 the last thing you want to do is have a situation where you have a train stuck between stations
6705367 other than i wish the buses would come a little more often its pretty good
6705368 i used it all of the time over there which is why i kind of wish it was better here
6705369 i lived in vienna and i could go anywhere within minutes over there but here its not as prevalent so it takes longer
6705370 i dont have the patience to wait for or keep up with the bus and train schedule
6705371 you cant put a price on time so even with gas prices going up and down im still better off controlling my own schedule
6705372 because the time i spend trying to get from my house to a bus and from one bus to the train and off the train to another bus that doesnt go directly to my office im still losing money if you want to put a dollar amount on time
6705373 i gave up trying to figure out their bus system
6705374 i wish there were more buses and it was easier for people to use
6705375 it feels like its starting to be more acceptable if anything because i guess people are starting to realize its a free country and they can do what they want to do
6705376 i do feel safe because i was raised on the south side but its more dangerous on the south side i think than any other part of marta
6705377 young immature wannabe thugs who behind closed doors theyre our sisters
6705378 it dont bother me it used to but words dont hurt me anymore im grown and mature and i let it go in one ear and out the other
6705379 i feel like im on this train riding im already having a rough day and then i have a person come up to me just calling me all kinds of fags and stuff like that and its not fair
6705380 its never been a problem in my 21 years here
6705381 usually we have officers that get to them pretty quickly
6705382 an officer is no more than one station away from where you are
6705383 because im built it might offend or other guys look at me and might be scared to say something
6705384 ive been here for a year and i havent really seen on marta trains or buses like any gay couple interacting like holding or kissing each other
6705385 maybe girls but ive never seen guys on the train before i dont know why
6705386 three doors down is michael cunningham i ran into tony kushner in the neighborhood and saw doug wright going to play tennis thats a lot of pulitzer prize award winners in just a small neighborhood
6705387 ive been doing this interviewing celebrities for over 30 years its my truck driving job i drive the truck with glamorous cargo to deadline
6705388 but i felt it was the right word to be true to the story i wanted to tell and i liked how it sounded with mississippi
6705389 i think its because they used it on the playground growing up they used sissy like pansy and faggot they used the word as a weapon
6705390 but i feel its like the word queer if you take it back you deflate the negative meaning of the word
6705391 but the more you identify as a gay author the more difficult it is to break into the mainstream
6705392 even in my mainstream stuff there is a gay vibe
6705393 in every book i write there a character i know who should be gay
6705394 just because were gay we dont have to write exclusively about gay issues
6705395 i didnt know there were these stories and i knew they were important enough to share with others
6705396 ive been approached but im not making any commitments right now
6705397 its still a year away at this point thats a long time
6705398 the city has a lot of problems that we have barely touched and i have not been on the finance committee
6705399 for three years ive been told that weve been doing this and now only recently ive found out we are not doing it
6705400 i was very disappointed to hear that but totally supportive her reasoning of her pulling out taking care her parents
6705401 i believe lisa borders would have been the most effective person for the job
6705402 i would love to see the festivals back in piedmont park
6705403 a very large percent of the communication that i have gotten from people about festivals in the park favor putting festivals back in the park
6705404 they will make it as soon as they can make and i dont think they can make it until the fall
6705405 its urgent in that we still have artists making decisions what show they are going to attend this year and if we dont have options on what we can show them they are going to go with a sure thing
6705406 its tough because we dont know whats going to happen to the park and its really out of our control
6705407 i think it is the first choice for a venue for most folks however to be prepared for another ban we plan to start evaluation of other venues in the next several weeks
6705408 i hope folks see atlanta for its beauty and close knit community
6705409 they should take away a once in a lifetime experience and know that its not the same as other prides
6705410 we really try to give a variety not every party is going to be the same
6705411 whether it be a theme party or a fashion show or live entertainment or go go dancers we just try to offer a lot of different options for the ladies
6705412 people look forward to seeing something different than just your standard party
6705413 its just a great party and the energy is always good
6705414 its really just about trying to keep it exciting each year
6705415 it will celebrate our accomplishments but at the same time it deals with challenges and issues that impact us
6705416 what we really wanted to impress upon our guests and visitors is with it being a historical election year we really want people to move from dialogue to action
6705417 of course people highlight the party aspect of what goes on here during black gay pride
6705418 but there are a lot of things that are going on dealing with empowerment and community upliftment and things like that
6705419 the entire summit will be driven by politics for the most part how do we make the best political decisions for the lgbt community
6705420 and they will also get good substantive information that they can take back to their community to empower their community
6705421 we never expected these results people should get what they pay for
6705422 we really like sushi and wed take home fish samples and put them in alcohol
6705423 americans spend an estimated 70 billion 38 billion pounds per year on seafood and we think authorities should do routine of fish
6705424 it bears on a number of issues food safety fraud and
6705425 most ongoing bubbles have innocent if ignorant victims who ultimately pay the financial price but unless those americans read lewrockwell com or consult history directly they do not understand why they are hurting and why they are paying so far the state created bubbles have been successfully portrayed as victimizing a thin regional or economic slice of the population and most importantly as being caused by a non state non government villain for housing the villain was evil mortgage lenders and colluding appraisers for the credit bubble it was the nasty raptors in the credit card industry and in banking the villains were as always a few bad apples fannie mae and freddie mac blamed everyone but itself and with oil we found that the bubble was the direct malevolent act of oil speculators a delightful exception is the war bubble
6705426 if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
6705427 heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into
6705428 as the mccain campaign desperately tries to find out how many houses john mccain owns they are launching false and thoroughly debunked attacks
6705429 barack obama offered the best price of any bidder in the market for his home the only home he owns every dime of which he paid for himself
6705430 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6705431 a great symbol for obama to try to paint mccain as out of touch

6705443 its about human rights to let palestinians and visitors travel freely to and from palestinian lands what could be more basic than that
6705444 for me the important thing wasnt about rights or the benefits
6705445 i just wanted the tribe to say yes we recognize that you are just as important as any other tribe member and we will treat you and your spouse as we treat all tribal members
6705446 it can do anything good or anything bad to the tribes and the indian people as citizen indians
6705447 for our tribe we want people to walk in the shoes of other people and learn to respect differences
6705448 only a strong military can deter outside aggression and protect the lives and safety of the people
6705449 only a strong military can create a rich and powerful country and contribute to world peace and prosperity
6705450 there should not be a war again in this country
6705451 but if war breaks out south korea and the u s should always have a readiness to end it by that night
6705452 if they eat too much chocolate in the game it is bad for their bimbos bodies and their happiness levels compared to if they eat fruit and vegetables which reinforces positive healthy eating messages
6705453 childrens innocence should be protected as far as possible it depends on the background and mindset of the child but the danger is that after playing the game some will then aspire to have breast operations and take diet pills

6705458 what weve heard in the market is that sinopec looked at it but they didnt really go through with it in any serious form the talk in the market about sinopec is overblown
6705459 we know theis houses their childrens schools the times where their wives are alone at home
6705460 we do realise that for the other people on that plane the hijack was terrifying and we regret causing such fear in the hearts of others
6705461 but we did it because we were desperate and we did not believe we could all get away safely in any other way
6705462 we warn that if the aid is cut and if this continues in the near future this land will witness a humanitarian disaster and the occupiers and their supporters will be responsible
6705463 youre an overcomer more than a conqueror today discover the champion in you
6705464 in those days as a young minister he was taught that you had to be poor in order to be holy in the churches he pastored he did his part and stayed holy and they did their part and kept him poor

6705473 i was putting my trust in god so from an islamic point of view yes
6705474 before moussaoui took the stand his lawyers made a last attempt to stop him from testifying but failed
6705475 different to die in a battle than in a jail on a toilet
6705476 it depends if you have if you have fought to the best of your ability it can depend on your intention the same action can have two very different result so for us a shaheed mean martyr at war and you do not aim to be a shaheed you fight and if you meant to come you come you dont decide ok im going to be a shaheed even if you dont die shaheed if you pray five times a day and you are truthful to god you go to heaven
6705477 the message in a bottle was really quite a find and surprised us all and were delighted to be able to reunite the owner with this piece of history
6705478 we have been waiting for this moment for 15 years
6705479 we did the job and we were loading the patient in the back of the ambulance when we heard a cat let out a big meow
6705480 someone said there was a cat on the roof and i looked up and was very surprised to see it was my cat chloe
6705481 on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
6705482 i cant wait to show it off at school its way better than having a playstation said rudra khurana a 14 year old delhi high school student standing next to his beaming father
6705483 indians tend to buy the most fancy cell phones and the iphone has a massive fan following everywhere
6705484 it is seen as a status symbol an aspirational product so you can expect to see not just the rich but also tech savvy youngsters and people in small towns buying it
6705485 we cant change phones on a daily basis we have to keep the future in mind and 3g will come to india soon
6705486 my father had between nine and 11 wives and unfortunately it really hurt us kids because there was no family cohesion it was really bad for us

6705523 you know pray for me because i feel that i am annoying satan
6705524 the thrust of this is the international community is still trying to respond to the needs of the palestinian people
6705525 we were hoping that their decision could be more positive in dealing with the palestinian government since it is an elected government that represents the palestinian people
6705526 you should not shy away from of this this is resistance not terrorism
6705527 invites members to consider their own responsibility for ensuring equity and non discrimination in contacts with israeli educational institutions or individuals and to
6705528 general lack of tolerance of israeli jews toward israeli arabs
6705529 israeli democracy has not developed a strong sense of egalitarianism and community
6705530 separating the two population groups by defining a border between them
6705531 such a withdrawal ought to be coordinated with the palestinians
6705532 we are waiting for a similar call from the palestinian directed upon the israeli schoolboys in which they invite the terrorists of the pa to shut all the terrorist who are attacking the civil population of israel by exploding themselves
6705533 i think that nasrallah has a reasoned argument and a persuasive argument that they the weapons should be in the hands of hizbollah as a deterrent to potential aggression and there is plenty of background and reasons for that so i think his position if i am reporting it correctly and it seems to be a reasonable position is that until there is a general political settlement in the region and the threat of aggression and violence is reduced or eliminated there has to be a deterrent the lebanese army cannot be a deterrent
6705534 by far most companies are pursuing very limited footprints toe prints really instead of comprehensive ones
6705535 we are nearing the 2 600 level now so maybe we will swing back to a rally next week

6705550 plain checks always look great but if your work atmosphere is casual you can opt for a shirt with a bit of classic embroidery on the collar and sleeves
6705551 semi casual checks can be worn to work with a cool t shirt inside it or even without a t shirt they look really smart on youngsters
6705552 these are the kind of checks i prefer wearing i think they can look even more stylish with retro glasses and a nice stylish bag to work
6705553 while wearing a checkered shirt make sure you select a tie with a colour that matches the dominant colour of the checks in your shirt

6705603 we willen aantonen dat isra l de gazastrook bezet houdt hoewel isra l dat ontkent we gaan dat testen als er geen bezetting is is er ook geen reden waarom wij niet naar gaza zouden kunnen varen als isra l ons stopt toont het dat het de bezettende macht is van een bezetting is sprake als een land een gebied beheerst
6705604 wij willen bewijzen dat de blokkade bedoeld is om de wil van de palestijnen te breken en hen rustig te krijgen en om de gazastrook van de westelijke jordaanoever af te sluiten
6705605 deze is gericht tegen burgers en dat is verboden volgens het internationale recht
6705606 wij zeggen dat de qassams en de terreuraanslagen symptomen zijn van een dieper liggend probleem waar geen militair antwoord op bestaat
6705607 ik pas de term warehousing toe op palestijnse kwestie als we over bezetting of apartheid praten gebruiken we politieke concepten er is dan een politieke dynamiek met verzet en onderhandelingen en het conflict kan worden opgelost zodra er sprake is van warehousing worden de palestijnen ontdaan van hun menselijkheid ze krijgen nooit een staat ze maken geen deel uit van de internationale gemeenschap en het enige wat je nog moet doen is hen permanent opslaan dat houdt in dat er een statische situatie wordt gecre erd waarbij ze niet meer tot last zulllen

6705616 it wouldnt be wise for me to be seen as picking a political side when ive consistently said both sides are right in some areas and wrong in some areas
6705617 this generation of values voters doesnt necessarily need to draw political battle lines the way previous generations have and that we can work through areas of disagreement toward common goals
6705618 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces

6705641 people with sleep apnea will suck the back of their throat shut when they try to breathe in like that when you have apnea youre actually cutting off airflow and it can happen repeatedly ever couple of seconds in a severe case
6705642 data would now suggest that sleep apnea can cause high blood pressure and that the severity of the apnea determines how likely it is to cause high blood pressure
6705643 the main coronary artery was 95 percent closed in that one so i had an angioplasty and a stent
6705644 i knew my father had apnea my father died of a stroke at age 62 but i look at that and i wonder now if i had treated my apnea back at age 20 25 when the snoring and stopping of breathing started would it have impacted the coronary progress i dont know
6705645 my father had apnea and he snored like he sawed wood as everybody said nobody knew about apnea no one talked about it

6705729 with upwards of 6 000 attending our services every sunday across seven campuses we view hd production as an important tool for keeping people engaged in the message and excited about worshipping with us at the same time a great deal of our content still exists in sd format and the cost of conversion gear was not within our budget
6705730 of the switchers we evaluated the kahuna was the only one that could automatically mix sd content into our hd production without requiring upconversion providing an easy and cost effective solution
6705731 houses of worship face similar challenges to broadcasters as they make the transition to hd production and typically even greater budget constraints churches need to preserve their existing investment in an sd infrastructure but at the same time they are trying to reach younger audiences with high expectations for the enhanced image quality and leading edge buzz that hd offers

6705961 we have plans to launch nano by october this year but many people dont want that to happen and its very easy for them to prevent it from happening but i have made a major investement here to move from here will be at a great cost not only for the tata group but also for west bengal

6706062 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6706063 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people

6706130 following a strenuous investigation conducted over the past weeks three haredi men suspected of hooliganism attacks and vandalism were arrested and brought before the court for a remand hearing the court extended their remand and the police plan to recommend that they be charged with severe violations and belonging to an illegal organization harassing some of the haredi community members whose conduct is not to the liking of the chastity squad thugs
6706131 on june 1 2008 at around 10 45 pm the defendant arrived with six other people at the complainants home armed with a bat and tear gas the defendant and the others shoved the complainant dropped her to the floor beat her slammed her head against the floor and kicked all parts of her body the defendant or one of the others sat on her head in a bid to prevent her from seeing what was going on and to prevent her from resisting the defendant and the others also tied a piece of cloth to the complainants mouth and warned her that should she open her eyes they would spray tear gas into them the defendant or one of the others interrogated the complainant on her relations with men and asked for those mens details the assailants took two cell phones from the complainant in order to check the names of those who called her at the end of the incident the defendant or one of the others told the complainant that she must leave her apartment otherwise this will only be the beginning and that if she remained there she would be murdered

6706146 we wanted the biggest name in adult entertainment so we obviously went out and got jesse jane
6706147 this is jesses first time at our club but we expect good stuff from her she puts on an energetic show and we are really excited to have her so is everyone else cause the phones have been ringing off the hook
6706148 every time jesse is out there she gives it her all
6706149 when youre the best in the world there is never any time to let up jesse continues to excel in her performances on stage and in front of the camera i admire her drive and focus and know that the fans do too
6706150 yeah for rhode island i was there around six months ago and am glad to be coming back people are so nice up there and i can always count on my fans to come out and support me people just need to get their butts in the seat and i will take care of the rest itll be the best show of their lives i want to get everyone so turned on that they cant stand it satisfied smiles are my reward
6706151 every time its in the news we get new leads
6706152 we know my sisters somewhere we just dont know where shes at have a heart if you do know something please please tell somebody
6706153 the move was hard it was really hard to go through my sisters things and pack them
6706154 my moms up in the air on what shes doing her main focus is still just finding my sister
6706155 by recovering such a valuable energy resource that otherwise could have been lost to disposal and by using an environmentally sensitive process to do it its a win win result for our planet and for areva
6706156 i think that once the country and the road users at all levels see the quality of the roads that would actually be tolled they will be more than happy to pay those tolls
6706157 our concern and our target will be for the quality of the road and just as i have said for the shortness of turnaround time for the safety to our persons and to our assets and in fact for the fact we can make journeys with a much lower per cent of ghastly carnage on our roads
6706158 the tolls could be incidental because tolls are actually taken in all developed countries or international expressways so in all the way we take it that is the only way we can sustain good quality roads but the high quality roads at the international quality roads will be put in place first before the tolls start

6706170 the city schools could never send four teams to the playoffs now they can
6706171 everything is tighter today budgets time resources and share of both consumer attention and brand manager attention
6706172 as a result companies let brands that are still viable but not their largest or fastest growing languish for years
6706173 then all of a sudden theyll focus on one of these
6706174 for instance miller high life had great vitality for years went dormant was given a shot in the arm a few years back and is now back in comatose stage
6706175 in reintroducing a product companies often change it to make it more relevant even when its actually still relevant and really needs more and better marketing
6706176 they change it so much that people lose their original emotional attachment to the product
6706177 most brands arent meant to live for eternity much as wed like to believe they are
6706178 some become outmoded or time and trends pass them by
6706179 if youre not going to invest in it sufficiently to make it competitive kill it and focus on your cash cows or sell it to someone with the passion and resources to give it a real chance

6706194 during hurricane floyd in 1999 we had evacuees from five states

6706197 we coordinate with the red cross and the georgia emergency management agency
6706198 our public works people are always on standby mainly what gets us is flash flooding and a need for shelter
6706199 it basically outlines how we manage construction and cleanup of debris
6706200 it provides for bins in rural areas and tells how to separate recycle incinerate and grind and we even know based on census blocks where the worst debris would be

6706205 the 200 meters and the 100 meters i saw both of those races when i was in london in 1948 the basketball like niagara falls has been much as i expected if the americans play as a team theyll win easily and they didnt four years ago coach k mike krzyzewski has got them playing as a team
6706206 i have nothing but positive feelings about this olympics michael phelps of course and the 200 meter track race was absolutely amazing that guy usain bolt just powered past them like they were going backwards i must say a highlight was the 4x100 meter swim relay when jason lezak beat the favored french team to the wall and the u s womens fencing went 1 2 3 in saber
6706207 i used to look at the east german system and the russian system kind of negatively when i was competing but i dont feel the same way now we have athletes who can make a living competing but the chinese have a school system and develop kids from very young i dont look at that in a bad way i dont pay much attention to the medal counts that doesnt matter to me if its a jamaican or a chinese winner great
6706208 ive been very impressed with the women throughout the games i think theyve really done well for the united states ive enjoyed watching the women win the beach volleyball both men and women indoor volleyball and the fantastic womens soccer match against brazil ive been impressed with the fact that they dont just show u s participation and show other countries that opens it up for a lot of interest for a lot of people
6706209 i felt so bad for our shot putter reese hoffa it broke my heart
6706210 that usain bolt was terrific unbelievable i like to see bolt flying around he was fantastic i think bolt is going to be in this olympics the defining moment thats the way i feel this man is a sensation and i saw the rowing it was very good
6706211 im disappointed at the whole professional situation going on if you win a gold medal you become rich sometimes not in rowing or fencing but in swimming or running a gold medal is worth tons of gold athletes get accustomed to idea that sport is only to make money
6706212 i think the fact that we see china as being a competitor in all aspects of life not just the games makes a big difference
6706213 you can just imagine in the next four years after this shot in the arm in china what theyre going to be like in london
6706214 think of 200 000 athletes working the last four years for this and still weve done pretty well
6706215 im grateful to my family for supporting me throughout my preparation i can say that i really enjoyed myself my participation in this pageant was exhausting but it ended successfully and it turned into the best school holiday ive ever had
6706216 ive prepared so well for this pageant ive learnt to be more lady like confident and also to believe in myself
6706217 most people would suspect that spending more than 14 billion on a controversial energy project that will lock up the savannah rivers resources for decades and decades into the future would have some major environmental impacts
6706218 weve definitely added more concerts and its being rented out by the public more this year than last year
6706219 we purposely tried to do more this year than last year because its an outside theater it gave us a chance to utilize the warm weather as much as we could
6706220 i think our concert average this year is right at 900 people every monday night and there are some concerts like the u s marine corps band in july where well get 2 000 people
6706221 there are probably four or five concerts where weve had over 1 000 in attendance
6706222 before we even dedicated it back in april the students were out there
6706223 its really become a gathering point because it is in the center of campus

6706227 they are the eyes and ears of the inner city
6706228 i think theyve done well reporting crime and being seen theyve cleaned up the inner city tremendously
6706229 i see them during the day all the time and thats important for them to have that visibility
6706230 seeing the caddies around improves the whole impression of downtown
6706231 these guys work on the hottest days of the month and they take some breaks but they do whatever it takes to keep downtown clean
6706232 it was all black from dust and dirt when we cleaned it it looked like brand new concrete i like that we can do this job and look back and see what weve done

6706245 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6706246 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6706247 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation

6706251 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6706252 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6706253 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6706254 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6706255 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6706256 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6706257 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6706258 im starting to lose it i cant remember whats real or not
6706259 im well aware vegas is in the middle of a desert
6706260 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6706261 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6706262 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6706263 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6706264 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6706265 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6706266 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6706267 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6706268 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6706269 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6706270 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6706271 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6706272 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6706273 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6706274 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6706275 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6706276 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6706277 lagi kesel ya ga pernah dpt job toh cucian deh elo masa kalah ma saya blogger balita baru ikutan paid review blm ada sebln jobku dah 35 lho kekekeke p
6706278 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6706279 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6706280 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6706281 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6706282 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6706283 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6706284 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6706285 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6706286 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6706287 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6706288 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6706289 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6706290 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6706291 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6706292 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6706293 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6706294 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6706295 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6706296 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6706297 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6706298 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6706299 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6706300 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6706301 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6706302 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6706303 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6706304 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6706305 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6706306 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6706307 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6706308 el cruce donde tienes que fijarte que no vengan aviones para pasar
6706309 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6706310 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6706311 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6706312 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6706313 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6706314 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6706315 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6706316 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6706317 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6706318 that to me is the most striking part about it transmitting 60 watts at 75 percent efficiency over several feet
6706319 the power pack for your laptop isnt that efficient its one of those things thats almost too good to be true
6706320 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6706321 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6706322 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6706323 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6706324 why would a just and loving god do so many destrusctive things
6706325 all matter is the product of the big bang but where did that come from
6706326 if time and space is neverending there where did we come from and where are we going

6706332 the only inheritance from my late husband this house we are living in now the mosque which use to be down there and the play ground are gradually disappearing before our presence and we are helpless
6706333 at least you can see for yourself that if nothing is urgently done to remedy this situation we will soon be rendered homeless all the efforts made by me and the other victims in the area have proved abortive
6706334 please if they will hear your voice tell them about our situation since my husband died i have been struggling to raise these children single handedly i have cried and cried to them for help and they are quiet is it when this erosion sweeps us away that they will come to our aid
6706335 even the state emergency management agency sema was alerted and its officials later came here to assess the situation and the extent of damage done but after that what is happening
6706336 infect we are tired of complaining to the concerned authorities who keep promising that something would be done and end up not doing anything how i wish i have the power to meet the state government myself

6706378 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6706379 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6706380 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia

6706396 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6706397 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6706398 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6706399 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6706400 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6706401 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6706402 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6706403 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6706404 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6706405 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

6706416 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6706417 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano

6706424 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6706425 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6706426 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6706427 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

6706440 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6706441 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6706442 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6706443 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6706444 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6706445 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6706446 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6706447 i record sono fatti per essere infranti dichiara ed io ho sempre sognato di fare quello che ha fatto spitz
6706448 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6706449 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6706450 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6706451 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6706452 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6706453 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6706454 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6706455 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6706456 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6706457 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6706458 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6706459 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6706460 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos

6706643 every year there seems to be something added on to my netball career
6706644 i guess this is the icing on the cake and something i certainly never thought would happen again
6706645 physically ive got to think am i up to it do i want to and still have that passion and desire and certainly i still have at this point and ive definitely committed myself to next year
6706646 it is a recall its back in the silver ferns but its a fresh start for me i just cant wait im just excited and itching to go its an amazing feeling really
6706647 yeah this one is sweeter obviously the hard work pays off it really just shows if you put your mind to it and commit to something that you really love and really enjoy you can come out with the bonuses and wins that you want
6706648 its pretty crazy im pretty stoked i didnt think i was going to make it this time around i was aiming for 2010 commonwealth games so im pretty darn excited about it

6706652 i felt a lot better in this match than i did yesterday
6706653 she moves very well but i know that girls at this level are going to miss eventually and was ready to grind it out on the court today
6706654 i wasnt even thinking about playing pro tournaments until the beginning of this year
6706655 its nice to be home though when youre playing in a tournament
6706656 im thinking about taking a year off after high school and playing more pro tournaments before making a decision from there
6706657 i didnt lose serve once today so that was very good for me
6706658 because i was able to break her serve once more in the second set i started to feel very comfortable from that point on
6706659 it wasnt easy for me to play with all of these distractions
6706660 i was playing the whole time but it was never at one hundred percent obviously
6706661 theres no way you can do that unless youre completely focused
6706662 the first thing he told me was that i had to have fun doing this
6706663 i couldnt be any happier with the results so far
6706664 to be winning this many tournaments so far is just amazing
6706665 we assume that your intentions are good but in fact the result of your action is that you are supporting the regime of a terrorist organisation in gaza
6706666 im so glad it is a victory to be leaving the port without the boats being sabotaged
6706667 no matter what happens we have already achieved our goal by proving that ordinary citizens with ordinary means can mobilise a defence of human rights for palestinians
6706668 we want people to see the palestinian problem as one of human rights not feeding them rice
6706669 i think we have a really good chance of making it ive got to be optimistic im nervous but excited because its about the people waiting for us on the other side
6706670 this is an effort to break the wall of silence surrounding gaza the eu and international community pretend they dont know whats happening in gaza children are starving there

6706672 and progress in the next 100 years will be more like the progress of the past 20 000 years because of technology
6706673 we will need new materials to improve transistor performance and new technologies like tri gate transistors which give more power lower leakage and better density
6706674 cmos will be the platform of the processor and then we will have other things on top of that

6706681 financially kdb will not have a problem buying a majority stake in lehman as the u s banks market cap has fallen sharply over the months
6706682 the problems however are legal and regulatory issues i am not so sure if the u s government will easily allow a foreign bank to purchase a significant stake in one of its key financial institutions

6706685 we have to start stringing together some wins we cant just keep winning one here losing one there weve got to get on a streak here hopefully that can start friday night
6706686 we have to do better if we want to play in october
6706687 we made things happen we had that winning attitude right now it feels like we have to be a little perfect we have to do everything right to catch a break and get a win
6706688 hes not the best pitcher in the game for nothing
6706689 hes so good hed be the ace on any team in the big leagues
6706690 my sinker wasnt there my slider wasnt there my changeup wasnt there i pitched like crap and i let these guys down today
6706691 pretty much from here on out its just so close were trying to win every game for the team if i clean up on decisions great but im just trying to go out and get deep into the game give us a chance to win
6706692 ive got a lot of confidence especially with the guys hitting out there and playing defense behind me the way they are
6706693 ive been able to get down in the zone low and get a lot of ground balls and strikeouts
6706694 it put a little length between us and l a
6706695 nows the time of year we start looking when we start following other teams and looking at the scoreboard we need to take care of business
6706696 he gets more people to chase pitches down in the zone so you just have to be really patient and really selective at what you swing at
6706697 i was introduced to it by paul tseng you know him hes my source for cloisonne vases
6706698 thats right theres a place in yunnan province an area called puen a place of tea plantations where the locals pick jungle tea tea from wild tea trees these tea trees are the original source of the worlds tea in ancient times this tea was picked for the emperor the people are lahu chinese and they use young girls as pickers how does it taste
6706699 it hasnt been sweetened smell that fragrance it varies from place to place tea from high up in the hills smells and tastes different than tea from the valleys
6706700 this is to symbolize a new beginning in lewis life i dont know what it is but hes up to something
6706701 is word art its nothing without words explanations descriptions dissertations and other forms of bullshit
6706702 this is where it all began right up here on the pennsylvania new york border this is where rockefeller made it and this is where at least according to tradition the finest petroleum could be found of course the big fields were out in texas and oklahoma and california and other places but now they have started drilling in the appalachians again
6706703 here in northern and central west virginia theyre drilling and theres a little company there thats written up in forbes its ripe for a knowledgeable investor id go find the guy that runs this company and talk to him
6706704 if they were written up in forbes there must be a line a mile long trying to get in
6706705 and if there is a line whos to say you cant get in it id go talk to the guy
6706706 eats good and then goes and gets laid hes a no nonsense type if you know what i mean but if youre looking for him he always sits right over in that corner by the potted palm plant and he comes in after the rush is over with about 2 00 in the afternoon
6706707 but if you come back tomorrow our special is gonna be barbeque short ribs
6706708 how stupid of me not to get some kind of a phone number or some kind of an address

6706720 the data was held in a secure format on the contractors site it was downloaded on to a memory stick for processing purposes which has since been lost
6706721 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost the data loss reinforces the need for data protection to be taken seriously at all levels
6706722 this is a massive failure of duty it is not the first time that the government has been shown to be completely incapable of protecting the integrity of highly sensitive data
6706723 deeply disappointing that a loss of this kind had happened yet again
6706724 what is also worrying is that a separate organisation was involved in looking at this data
6706725 one would expect the home office to have this data but if you hand out memory sticks almost like confetti to companies that are meant to do research for you then you need to be absolutely certain that when you give such information away the company concerned have put into practice procedures that are just as robust as the procedures that i hope the government has followed since the loss of the child benefit discs
6706726 ive written to jacqui smith today to say i am deeply disappointed with whats happened in the view of what ministers have said to the select committee
6706727 one of the problems is that it is very hard to get rid of people who are not doing their jobs properly
6706728 once you get into the government civil service youre virtually unsackable no matter how incompetent you actually are
6706729 i think jacqui smith is going to have to do a lot of explaining to the home affairs select committee when we go back in october

6706788 gilpatrick letting his filly out she shot to the front and at the half mile pole was half a length ahead of the lucy fowler colt ruthless improved her position on the third quarter stretch and was a clear length ahead of her pursuers as they swung into the homestretch and without apparently being urged to her highest speed galloped home a winner of the race by two lengths

6706798 weve had great success with enterprise repeats on monday night and theres an appetite for space opera as battlestar goes away
6706799 theres an opportunity to keep the space opera as part of our programming strategy
6706800 this is an opportunity to reinvent this franchise and make it relevant to a new generation
6706801 we really dont want to be more of the same its going to build clearly off the existing franchise but with a cast that gives it a younger vibe
6706802 in universe we plan to keep those elements that have made the franchise a success such as adventure and humor while breaking new ground in the relationships between mostly young and desperate explorers thrust together and far from home above all we believe the stargate itself remains an enduring icon with infinite potential as a jumping off point for telling stories
6706803 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6706804 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6706805 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6706806 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6706807 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6706808 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6706809 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6706810 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6706811 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6706812 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6706813 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6706814 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6706815 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6706816 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6706817 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6706818 el coi ha cumplido con su obligaci n de que se esclarezcan todas las dudas y estamos a la espera del informe final de la fig pero por el momento no hay evidencia de que hayan incumplido las normas de elegibilidad por edad tambi n se han entregado certificados de nacimiento que son correctos
6706819 china ha presentado todos los documentos que demuestran la edad de las gimnastas y que han sido aptas para competir tanto que la propia federaci n internacional les dio luz verde para hacerlo

6706829 once you get into the government civil service youre virtually unsackable no matter how incompetent you actually are
6706830 i think jacqui smith is going to have to do a lot of explaining to the home affairs select committee when we go back in october
6706831 having the boomerang back in kurnell will be a historic symbol of harmony between our two cultures and will help teach young australians about the importance of aboriginal culture
6706832 kevin rudd should use his relationship with british prime minister gordon brown to convince the u k government to purchase the boomerang and donate it to australia in a gesture of friendship and to mark our shared heritage
6706833 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6706834 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6706835 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6706836 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6706837 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6706838 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6706839 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6706840 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6706841 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best

6706844 we never expected these results people should get what they pay for
6706845 we really like sushi and wed take home fish samples and put them in alcohol
6706846 americans spend an estimated 70 billion 38 billion pounds per year on seafood and we think authorities should do routine of fish
6706847 it bears on a number of issues food safety fraud and
6706848 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6706849 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6706850 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6706851 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6706852 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6706853 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6706854 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6706855 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6706856 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6706857 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6706858 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6706859 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6706860 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6706861 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6706862 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6706863 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6706864 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6706865 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6706866 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6706867 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6706868 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6706869 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6706870 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6706871 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6706872 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6706873 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6706874 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6706875 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6706876 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6706877 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6706878 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6706879 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6706880 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6706881 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6706882 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6706883 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6706884 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6706885 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6706886 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6706887 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6706888 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6706889 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6706890 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6706891 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6706892 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6706893 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6706894 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6706895 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6706896 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6706897 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas

6706900 i was surprised when i heard about the meeting of the council
6706901 the draft itself is not finalised and such a meeting should take place at the invitation of the president or the prime minister which has not happened certainly there will be no meeting today
6706902 the security situation is deteriorating and its worrisome for europe
6706903 riddled with internal problems and are mainly aiming to raise internal troop morale
6706904 parts of the walls have fallen off the fence is destroyed cars are buried under the rubble
6706905 we love you you have done well carry on the good work in the service of our father land
6706906 i will today forgive all those who went to court to bear false witnesses against me
6706907 i forgive all our bigmen who out of sheer envy and jealousy have forgotten that they have a nation that they have to fight for
6706908 luckily those who printed t shirts those who made wrapper campaigning has also gone on air to say they did not do so
6706909 god will fight for us all those who did not support us if they wish to continue we must let them know that we shall not look back we are moving forward
6706910 we wish to state that there is no financial involvement of the commission in the matter and we wish to reassure our stakeholders as well as the public that the accounts and operations of the commission have passed all checks and balances and have been found to be in order
6706911 indeed we hereby restate that we will continue to conduct the affairs of the commission with utmost decency probity and transparency and respect to due process and the rule of law
6706912 none of us must be too hasty to propose any steps that could further weaken the fragile development and peace process currently being delicately managed by the federal government with less than desired success to show for all the bluster and rhetoric let us all seek the aggregate best for the common good of our peoples eschewing self serving vendettas
6706913 we want to state that the vast majority of the people of the niger delta will benefit more and nddc will perform better if it is well funded
6706914 weve had great success with enterprise repeats on monday night and theres an appetite for space opera as battlestar goes away
6706915 theres an opportunity to keep the space opera as part of our programming strategy
6706916 this is an opportunity to reinvent this franchise and make it relevant to a new generation
6706917 we really dont want to be more of the same its going to build clearly off the existing franchise but with a cast that gives it a younger vibe
6706918 in universe we plan to keep those elements that have made the franchise a success such as adventure and humor while breaking new ground in the relationships between mostly young and desperate explorers thrust together and far from home above all we believe the stargate itself remains an enduring icon with infinite potential as a jumping off point for telling stories
6706919 sg 1 ran for 10 seasons launching on showtime in 1997 then moving to sci fi after its fifth season
6706920 more than ten million british households were dealt a fresh blow to their finances yesterday as e on and scottish and southern energy sse became the latest power companies to raise gas and electricity bills by as much as 29 per cent
6706921 one is that we can avoid the ethical issues of stem cells because wisdom teeth are destined to be thrown away anyway
6706922 also we used teeth that had been extracted three years ago and had been preserved in a freezer that means that its easy for us to stock this source of stem cells
6706923 because extractions of wisdom teeth are commonly operated in dental clinics we can expect a lot of donors of stem cells
6706924 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6706925 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6706926 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6706927 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6706928 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity

6706942 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6706943 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6706944 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

6706974 the door is open for 24 years worth of vat claims from 1973 when the uk joined the eu to 1997 when the law was changed
6706975 many companies whom we have spoken to about their eligibility to submit claims were previously completely unaware that the opportunity even existed perhaps because 1997 is so far away
6706976 but if businesses dont act quickly they run a risk of losing out as all claims must be submitted by the end of march next year and this is much sooner than it may appear as the process for putting a claim together involving extrapolating back as obviously records dating back to the early seventies will not be available this can be time consuming leaving it too late could prove very costly
6706977 the sums at stake are often substantial we have seen claims ranging from 50 000 to several million pounds and this could make a huge difference to whether a business makes it through these difficult times or not because of the opportunity exists to go back so far even small amounts that are under claimed in any one year can be significant if it is extended back in time

6707100 a daily mail population is not necessarily something we should be worried about it is something we should be absolutely terrified of
6707101 no really im moving to new zealand weve got friends there and its 11 000 miles away so ill feel safe
6707102 by 2014 most conversations in the uk will be about polish baby factories the shocking number of underage abortions being performed near your house and of course fern brittons pudgy thighs and why shell never eat another wagon wheel
6707103 this will inevitably lead to a big increase in general taxation to pay for wiping up whats left of all the people who have thrown themselves out of tall buildings rather than listen to another word about why so many celebrities are choosing to carry their own luggage these days
6707104 personally im in favour of subjecting daily mail readers to an intensive course of electric shock therapy living in a big glass tube can add 40 years to your life say experts

6707111 es sind nicht die kinder welche probleme bereiten es sind die alten welche nie gelernt haben was freude am lernen und lebenslanges lernen bedeutet
6707112 wenn das hessische lehrerbildungsgesetz das hlbg wie von allen parteien versprochen noch 2008 novelliert wird darf es nicht nur kosmetische korrekturen geben grundlegende nderungen sind notwendig
6707113 arbeitsstress pur ist das negative qualit tsmerkmal in der hessischen lehrerausbildung
6707114 vorrangig m ssen die enorme arbeitsverdichtung und arbeitszeiterh hungen in das zentrum der reform des hlbg ger ckt werden
6707115 auch die mentorinnen und mentoren m ssen f r ihre t tigkeit an den ausbildungsschulen entlastet werden in der regel beraten und betreuen sie ihre liv zwei bis vier stunden in der woche dies umsonst daher fordern wir eine entlastung von einer stunde je liv und ausbildungsschule
6707116 fast zwei drittel aller hessischen lehrkr fte haben die gew mit dem besten ergebnis aller zeiten zur dominierenden kraft gemacht als einzige organisation hat sie ein vollst ndiges modell zur reform des p dagogischen vorbereitungsdienstes vorgelegt zudem wird sie einen kompletten gesetzentwurf zur novellierung des hlbg anl sslich der beratungen im landtag anbieten f r die verbesserung der ausbildung ist die humanisierung der arbeitsbedingungen zwingend erforderlich deshalb wird die gew alle vorschl ge ablehnen die nicht die arbeitszeiten der ausbilderinnen und ausbilder liv mentorinnen und mentoren in unserem sinne drastisch reduzieren

6707121 its a full circle the soulful music era of 60s and 70s will be recreated soon in 80s and 90s the industry saw the growth of ghazals and disco dance numbers then came sufi songs so its time for melodious songs again
6707122 i wont comment on music directors like pritam or himmesh reshamiya who are popular but compose music keeping in mind the beats and tunes there are other like shankar mahadeven legendary a r rehman for who melody is still a priority songs of the film taare zameen par shows listeners still want to hear good songs
6707123 it is very difficult to predict natural as well as manmade disasters therefore constant vigilance is necessary and preparedness is all the more necessary
6707124 while there will be no shortage of funds the cooperation and coordination at various levels should be better than what we are doing now

6707131 weve all got a kind of love hate relationship with the university of washington
6707132 affects the health safety or security of any member of the university community or the mission of the university
6707133 we have a responsibility to educate our students about being responsible citizens
6707134 for me the important thing wasnt about rights or the benefits
6707135 i just wanted the tribe to say yes we recognize that you are just as important as any other tribe member and we will treat you and your spouse as we treat all tribal members
6707136 it can do anything good or anything bad to the tribes and the indian people as citizen indians
6707137 for our tribe we want people to walk in the shoes of other people and learn to respect differences
6707138 some of the letters i have seen have not been as informative as they could have been which is a disservice to both consumers and businesses
6707139 if i am a consumer and i learn that i am part of the largest breach in history i should be happy because the likelihood of my name being used at random is very low
6707140 but if i am part of an internal breach of 10 identities i should be very concerned
6707141 the disclosure laws should be refined to give consumers this type of information
6707142 right now these letters dont mean anything if there are no details consumers dont have enough information to make an educated decision about what to do
6707143 there are some collections of hackers who are quite precise about what they are going to steal and what they will do with the data
6707144 people are stealing the data and using it themselves or giving it to someone they know
6707145 se introduciamo la politica nel consiglio rischiamo di richiamarci ad un modello autoritario ovverosia quello fascista dove la magistratura non e indipendente dal potere politico e quindi non tutti i cittadini sono garantiti allo stesso modo
6707146 abbiamo visitato i siti che ospiteranno il g8 del 2009 e sono sicuro che offriremo ai capi di stato qualcosa di straordinario i lavori procedono bene non ci sar nessun rinvio nei programmi

6707148 tutti i libri di testo insegnavano i valori del fascismo che dovevano formare gli italiani del domani disciplinati e fieri allo stesso tempo
6707149 non discuto larte ma se poi i miei fedeli parlano di porcherie piazzate sulla pubblica via sono costretto a intervenire

6707186 wir werden k nftig per ausschreibung entscheiden von welchem anbieter wir das netz nutzen
6707187 asien indien und russland sind neue produktionsstandorte aber auch k nftige absatzm rkte f r westliche wie internationale kunst
6707188 was sich ndert ist die infrastruktur des marktes und noch mehr des kunstsystems
6707189 saumbiotope und vernetzungsstreifen zur f rderung der biodiversit t und des artenschutzes in ackerlandschaften
6707190 f r uns ist dabei von besonderem interesse die lebensbedingungen der feldvogelarten wie rebhuhn und feldlerche und der insekten zu verbessern aber auch f r amphibienarten die auf wanderkorridore innerhalb gro er ackerschl ge angewiesen sind k nnen positive effekte erwartet werden
6707191 damit leistet dieses projekt einen wichtigen beitrag f r den artenschutz in ackerlandschaften
6707192 wesentlich f r den erfolg des projektes ist das pers nliche engagement und eigenverantwortliche handeln der landwirte und j ger wenn es darum geht vor ort praktikable l sungen zu entwickeln
6707193 auf grund der positiven erfahrungen an dem pilotprojekt pr ft jetzt das umweltministerium solche ackerstreifen k nftig landesweit ber den vertragsnaturschutz zu f rdern und hierf r landes bundes und eu mittel einzusetzen
6707194 my main concern was to clear my name not about what punishment bertolino would get
6707195 i told the chief i would smile and take it for all the stuff i probably got away with over the years
6707196 everything was just kind of clicking i had a great start silver im psyched
6707197 we got three medals out of six thats pretty damn good
6707198 our confidence is 100 percent above what it was at the end of last year
6707199 they have been impressive in the preseason scrimmages and they certainly were against us last year
6707200 sharitz has a fine arm and he can really throw the ball it looks like if necessary the passing game can carry them gw so we will have to be ready for a wide open attack
6707201 lester is very quick and has great pursuit on defense
6707202 it had been my plan to propose and i had told someone at big brother then lo and behold within ten minutes of entering the house i was getting married
6707203 theyve got an awful good football team real good quickness
6707204 were going to have to go down there tomorrow and control the line of scrimmage
6707205 we laid the ball down about four times last year and thats what weve really got to be careful against
6707206 we cant make turnovers weve got to control the ball weve got to get the ball and keep the ball and not make those types of mistakes
6707207 were still making young mistakes but were ready to play
6707208 if youre a football coach youd like to play year round so it doesnt bother us when we start we just want to get out there and play
6707209 we learned a lot we made a great deal of progression between the first scrimmage and the second scrimmage we felt offensively
6707210 for what were looking for you can learn a lot from a scrimmage
6707211 were looking for a fight were looking for something to throw their nose in there when they block those are the types of things we are looking for small things big things are easily fixed were looking for small things
6707212 were still tweaking it we cant give them the whole offense at one time
6707213 weve got to bit and piece it and try to get the basics in right now and well try to tweak it as we go
6707214 we felt like we had to be much better up front
6707215 and we feel like were a little better up front now than when we finished up last year
6707216 youre pleased with some respects and some respects youre not pleased
6707217 i guess if you werent completely pleased you wouldnt practice
6707218 what weve learned from the previous scrimmages is that we could make adjustments on the run because we had no idea what anybody was going to run
6707219 we had no idea what they were going to run offensively or defensively and we were able to adjust on the run and make adjustments
6707220 weve been able to work the last two weeks just on christiansburg
6707221 we work on one game only we work on one game at a time
6707222 theyre ranked eighth in the state and they return 19 starters from their championship team from last year and they have seven players that have played three years so its not going to be easy
6707223 weve had a couple of scrimmages and our defense is swarming and theyve done a good job in coverage defensive back christian hearl has three interceptions in the preseason and jack vance has one
6707224 were happy with the tackling job the linebackers are doing
6707225 derek jackson and eric stiltner are doing a good job for us at linebacker and roy christian and chuck payne are doing a great job on the defensive line and theyre solid
6707226 our line is improving each week and we have a new group of receivers that is progressing one area were worried about is special teams since tonight is the first time theyve been live and the first time some of them have played under the lights
6707227 they have good fan support in gate city and its definitely going to be a challenge for us
6707228 i felt like id do a lot better than this
6707229 when you practice and youre out there by yourself and you just want to turn it on and go you just go
6707230 im really disappointed in how flat i was in the last 200 meters
6707231 a lot of people dont understand that in running you practice different things just like a basketball team practices different plays you practice different segments of a race i really practiced closing it didnt work out well
6707232 ive got nothing else going on so i might as well
6707233 the other girls were just more ready to go it might just be one bad race its a shame it had to come at the olympics
6707234 aside from the disappointment of not making it and being under pressure for two weeks it was an amazing experience
6707235 when she gets fired up it gets us so happy because she is such a reserved person seeing her that overwhelmed and excited makes us all even more excited
6707236 its unbelievable all the time all the effort all the complaining about practice we know thats what got us here we just came out and fought this is what we all came for
6707237 we got them off their jump serve and that got them off rhythm
6707238 i dont think they expected us to come out as prepared as we were
6707239 im happy for them its their dream my responsibility is to them
6707240 she is part of our family this makes it even sweeter
6707241 weve worked so hard were still practicing and fighting and i know we can get better we know we already have a medal which is unbelievable why not go for gold
6707242 we got out there early got some runs and never stopped i guess
6707243 they came in swinging the bat and everything we threw they hit
6707244 its just one of those nights you hate to see it but it happens and i give credit to my team they never quit
6707245 im not just saying this because youre standing there but you guys are all so cool it was hard to find someone to pick on
6707246 i had to find someone who wanted to wreck me so that i could pick on him at every corner
6707247 you guys cant get me back this weekend so it was a great time to go about 50 miles per hour and wreck each other no one got hurt and it was a lot of fun
6707248 im just glad its over hes doing what he wants to do and the packers have moved on in another direction
6707249 its disappointing to me for him to be ending his career with another team but there was probably a lot that went on that we dont know about
6707250 i wish that it could have been handled differently they are both probably at fault
6707251 my take on it is that they should have gotten ready to play the giants and been in the super bowl
6707252 if they had gone to the super bowl brett probably would not have retired prematurely
6707253 carroll was before my time and obviously through playing before i started watching football but i certainly had heard of him in the packers hall of fame at lambeau field
6707254 hes a nice guy and really class guy it was an honor to meet him
6707255 its a lot racier than it used to be theres more than one groove you dont have to move someone to pass them so you can race a little harder all night
6707256 everything still happens fast and its still the most intense track that we race at no matter where we are at in the points i still get excited about going there
6707257 we believe the people who will buy this car will also be looking at an aston martin a porsche or a ferrari
6707258 this is a real sports car and we want to find those people who not only want that performance but who also care about the environment
6707259 we have made some great offers with some good deals and it would be a good move for the players involved
6707260 we think we did pretty well in the second half and gave west ham a bit of a doing their fans will go away thinking that wigan are a decent side
6707261 we are going to meet the club to speak about the situation
6707262 senderos there is nothing definite but the market is open until august 31
6707263 we have passed the second inspection and have been forecast a dry day
6707264 we have had 2 7mm of overnight rain and the going is still soft but we are racing
6707265 we have regrettably abandoned due to the state of the ground
6707266 the course had 4 5mm of rain on thursday and another similar deposit has been forecast for friday
6707267 first week back it takes a bit of time to get back into the swing of things and i did make a few mistakes out there
6707268 i wouldnt want to make them the next three days and hopefully i dont make them the next three days
6707269 i thought i played nicely but middle of the round i missed a number of really good birdie chances and then took four twice and two sixes
6707270 looking back at it you have to say i didnt feel like i did much wrong but some of thats that mental tiredness
6707271 it seems like the game of gaelic football lends itself to guys being physically fit and adept at australian rules theyll go home in the near future and and well sit down as a club and assess the whole situation the whole two weeks and how the boys went
6707272 we havent even thought if we would or wouldnt sign we have to go through an assessment stage yet thats probably a month or two down the track
6707273 a lot of people compare me to michael johnson i just try to be me i try to be myself
6707274 michael johnson revolutionised the sport i just changed it a little bit
6707275 a lot of people are hoping i do the 400m but dont hold your breath i wont be going after the 400 any time soon i am going to let it soak in that i am a double gold medallist
6707276 my next aim is to finish the season injury free and then look forward to the world championships
6707277 after the world championships maybe i will look forward to doing something else i am not sure anything is possible if i put my mind to it like i did this season
6707278 you cant tell a guy who has run 9 69sec how to react we should be happy for him and i am happy for him
6707279 i dont know what i would have done because ive never run 9 69sec these guys have trained for a long time and you would have to ask usain why he did what he did but its difficult for me to tell you i would not have done it it was a unique moment for an athlete who has worked very hard

6707281 i am ecstatic with that i have really struggled to get off to a good start this year in the first round
6707282 today thursday was great the second group out and no spike marks on the greens
6707283 a nice bit of sunshine came through this morning and i took advantage of the good greens
6707284 i threw in some birdies early on so i am very happy to start off with a 66

6707287 ive written before that my piece of the earth is populated by people not overly impressed by the petty posturing of law enforcement the last and only so far as i remember radar trailer to be parked down my road ended up tumbled on its side in need of an overhaul so a friendly warning that the county mounties are around the corner was hardly unusual and it was much appreciated but its just such small acts that make life bearable in an increasingly overgoverned society that warning certainly saved me a few minutes of getting hectored by the side of the road by one of yavapai countys finest as well as some money and possibly a bit of hassle with the insurance company it also reaffirmed the connections i have with my neighbors at the expense of government authority
6707288 i will be working with shah rukh khan for don 2 we will begin shooting for it in the second half of next year

6707325 unfortunately it would appear that the death rate remains constant and total as it has inviolably since the dawn of time
6707326 the inability of doctors and scientists to adequately address this issue of death is nothing less than a scandal
6707327 do you have any idea what a full blown case of death looks like well i do and believe me its not pretty in prolonged cases total decomposition of the corpse is the result
6707328 at this early date i dont want to start making broad generalizations
6707329 but it is beginning to seem possible that birth as well as the subsequent life cycle that follows it may be a serious safety risk for all those involved
6707330 those who suffer from death can be highly traumatized by it often so severely that it kills them
6707331 but it can also be very traumatic for the still living who are left behind the sudden cessation of metabolic activity characteristic of terminal cases of death often leaves the dead person in a position where they are unable to adequately provide for the emotional needs of their loved ones
6707332 but nobody seems to actually be doing anything about it i propose we stop molly coddling death not to mention the multi billion pound hospital mortuary funeral and burial industries that reap huge profits from it

6707344 the game of tennis is similar to the game of life
6707345 its a one on one sport where theres no one coaching you on the court and you have to figure it out on your own when your match is over is when you can get advice on what you did right and what you did wrong but for the most part it requires incredible self discipline and self control
6707346 my parents taught me that if you want something its up to you to get out there and bust your butt to make it happen
6707347 no one is going to hand anything to you my parents are my role models
6707348 while i was training in florida they graciously hosted me and my coach plus they also give me great advice about tennis and on life in general
6707349 because i was on the court instead of in the streets i escaped the life that so many young black brothers fall victim to gangs jail and teenage fatherhood
6707350 i made it a personal goal for myself to teach as many children the game of tennis as possible in hopes of seeing them get a tennis scholarship to attend college and saving their parents money
6707351 i figure if they can get into college on a tennis scholarship after about two years they might consider going pro
6707352 seeing an adult or a child hit their first tennis ball and it makes it over the net and stays in the court is a very rewarding feeling
6707353 as a tennis instructor nothing can compare to being there to witness your student whether theyre children or adults win their first match or tournament thats what i enjoy most about teaching tennis
6707354 come out to the arthur ashe tennis courts on a saturday morning we have adults young adults and children mostly black right here from south los angeles playing tennis in addition we have blacks come from all over southern california to play tennis at the arthur ashe tennis center because this is where most blacks who play tennis play in l a theres a real sense of camaraderie and focus on helping anyone interested in learning how to play theres nothing white or bourgeoisie about the game of tennis during south africas apartheid arthur ashe was denied a visa by the south african government keeping him out of the south african open he used the opportunity to call attention to south africas racism against blacks the williams sisters came straight out of compton in fact most people arent aware that there is still a lot of racism in tennis against blacks just ask venus and serena black people need to realize that when we use terms like acting white and bourgeoisie we discourage each other from reaching our full potential its no different than when kids tease each with acting white for being good students and brining home as on their report cards for me it comes down to knowing where your child is after school or for them to act black and join a gang and run the streets eventually ending up in jail or worse dead tennis is an opportunity much like we view basketball and football for our youth both females and males to excel in life why should white children be the only ones taking advantage of that
6707355 regina recently won her first tournament her sister maya pitts is fast on reginas heels at the age of five maya can already hit the ball from the baseline i credit the success of richard williams and his daughters venus and serena with inspiring a whole new generation of black tennis players the way that arthur ashe inspired me
6707356 stay focused and enjoy yourself always play the game of tennis with a smile on your face it helps theres nothing that you cant do with practice

6707422 the data was held in a secure format on the contractors site it was downloaded on to a memory stick for processing purposes which has since been lost
6707423 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost the data loss reinforces the need for data protection to be taken seriously at all levels
6707424 this is a massive failure of duty it is not the first time that the government has been shown to be completely incapable of protecting the integrity of highly sensitive data
6707425 deeply disappointing that a loss of this kind had happened yet again
6707426 what is also worrying is that a separate organisation was involved in looking at this data
6707427 one would expect the home office to have this data but if you hand out memory sticks almost like confetti to companies that are meant to do research for you then you need to be absolutely certain that when you give such information away the company concerned have put into practice procedures that are just as robust as the procedures that i hope the government has followed since the loss of the child benefit discs
6707428 ive written to jacqui smith today to say i am deeply disappointed with whats happened in the view of what ministers have said to the select committee
6707429 one of the problems is that it is very hard to get rid of people who are not doing their jobs properly
6707430 once you get into the government civil service youre virtually unsackable no matter how incompetent you actually are
6707431 i think jacqui smith is going to have to do a lot of explaining to the home affairs select committee when we go back in october

6707434 as a direct result i deeply regret that many uk and other international volunteers have had to leave iligan city and at least temporarily curtail their livelilhood services in muslim and christian communities in lanao
6707435 that they would value visits from northern ireland to discuss such issues as decommissioning of arms as well as the political process as northern ireland demonstrated clearly
6707436 international involvement and support can help tip discussions towards a peace agreement

6707968 i see a very very very big transformation thats going to change the balance of power in media
6707969 it will step away from the broadcast and cable networks to specialized niche programming that will be accessible through on demand services that is the revolution and nothing is going to stop this
6707970 all this is going to bypass the broadcast and cable networks
6707971 the whole notion that you sit at a television at a designated time and you tune in to watch what they say you over its going to take a while but its over
6707972 people are going to discover that content doesnt have to be produced by the major media companies
6707973 there is this attitude in the media industry that were the ones that make the big time media that people want yet its always been dark horses that the establishment didnt see that have created the changes in the media landscape hbo was a dark horse cnn was a dark horse espn was a dark horse so were vcrs and the technophobia in the media industry the resistance to changing business models the gut instinct to use their monopoly power to extract financial benefits all this will not serve the media companies well in the coming era

6707989 harganya tdl terlalu mahal sudah melakukan perubahan jam kerja dari lima hari menjadi tujuh hari kini malah mau menaikkan tarif listrik industri dimana konsistensi kebijakannya
6707990 jadi libatkan pula pengguna dalam hal ini pihak industri bila kebijakannya sudah menyangkut tarif
6707991 daripada menggeser jam kerja lebih baik membiarkan swasta memenuhi kebutuhan listrik mereka dengan genset atau cara lain yang mungkin lebih efisien
6707992 ini bukti tidak jelasnya dan tidak pastinya arah kebijakan kelistrikan juga bukti tidak adanya perencanaan yang matang terhadap segala langkah yang diambil dalam merespons permasalahan
6707993 satu kebijakan belum jalan dan belum selesai dievaluasi penuh sudah mau coba lagi yang baru
6707994 akibatnya sangat serius dan dirasakan hampir semua sektor untuk emergency agar listrik tetap menyala pemerintah harus membantu kesulitan finansial pln untuk membeli bahan bakar primernya

6707996 tidak perlu diatur pemerintah itu sesuai dengan aturan penarifan kalau pelanggan mau mendapatkan suplai yang berbeda daripada yang lainnya dan merundingkan b to b business to business dengan pln itu dimungkinkan dan boleh menurut aturan

6708090 this is the only uniform i could ever put on
6708091 she chose to be an american wearing a russian uniform
6708092 during the national anthem i was saying a prayer of thanksgiving that im an american
6708093 i know that in my heart i love my country
6708094 our job is to fight hard but on the mat yet we are all very nervous here wondering what will become of our country which made it difficult to concentrate
6708095 the raider organization the national football league and the world have lost a great man
6708096 he is as prominent a sportsman as the world has known
6708097 gene was a great player he was an all pro he was a hall of famer if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known
6708098 from what i hear he was a pretty good player
6708099 now that weve kissed we hope the press stops making us look like enemies
6708100 i threw out everybody except for siddharth and my makeup person while that scene was being shot its okay if you need to kiss your boyfriend onscreen but a stranger it was extremely difficult

6708109 the west had engineered the impasse in the talks so that their preferred leader takes over
6708110 tsvangirai keeps demanding more and the more he demands the more western sanctions are imposed so that we yield to his demands
6708111 that is a condition that will never happen a step that will never be taken by zanu pf as a party and the people of zimbabwe
6708112 di tre cose ero del tutto certa primo edward era un vampiro secondo una parte di lui chiss quale e quanto importante aveva sete del mio sangue terzo ero totalmente incondizionatamente innamorata di lui bella swan
6708113 di tre cose ero del tutto certa primo edward era un vampiro secondo una parte di lui chiss quale e quanto importante aveva sete del mio sangue terzo ero totalmente incondizionatamente innamorata di lui bella swan
6708114 this is what hillel used to do in memory of the temple
6708115 poverty was accepted moving from the gorbals to shawlands was like moving to heaven
6708116 the springboks did very well in cape town the all black scrum is on of the best in the world and the springboks scrummed exceptionally well
6708117 they definitely seemed to have improved their technique since we played them last the beast and cj van der linde looked exceptional
6708118 were a lot more technical we do a lot more work on our scrums with full time coach michael foley
6708119 i think hes been exceptional for me i couldnt have moved from loosehead to tighthead this year which isnt an easy task without his tutelage so ive got a lot of respect for michael
6708120 id been playing mainly loosehead up until the start of this years super 14 there was a void that needed to be filled in new south wales and michael thought that i had the make of a good tighthead
6708121 at the waratahs we had pretty good use of him last year hed come in one day a week or so but now to have him full time is fantastic from a scrumming point of view and hes excellent come line out time
6708122 i dont think theres any more motivation in test football than the game itself winning the game and performing and being formidable
6708123 some of that criticism was probably well justified so were just working hard at the moment to rectify that
6708124 in this tri nations its been going fairly well the scrums have been fairly solid al baxters done an exceptional job and now ive got a chance to hopefully add to that
6708125 come scrum time baxter has met the challenges of whoever hes faced i think hes also done more than that in a lot of the games aerobically round the paddock hes been a fantastic athlete
6708126 so i was surprised at a run but robbie deans has asked me to get out there and be combative and scrum well so ive just gotta get out there and perform
6708127 hes an excellent scrummager and an excellent player hes a very powerful explosive man youve seen how fast he is hes definitely fun to watch out wide i hopefully wont have to match up to him on the wing
6708128 beast is definitely a mobile player so the new rules definitely suit him
6708129 under the elvs the scrum ball is a massive attacking platform because theres ten metres between the back lines so if youre not getting quality ball youre really cutting down a lot of your primary possession
6708130 so a solid scrum is a massive attacking weapon especially for south africa who score a lot of tries from first phase
6708131 with the ball in play more so its obviously a faster game i think its not only fitness youve got to be smart
6708132 you cant just keep chasing the ball otherwise you just dont do anything you just run around so youve got to be a bit smarter and bit more deliberate in what you do
6708133 saya sempat diberitahu jika wigan berniat membawa saya ke jjb dengan status pinjaman namun hingga saat ini manajemen wigan belum menemui perwakilan dari middlesbrough
6708134 we didnt want to recreate it but to contemporise it

6708139 milan were available to welcome the player on loan with a right to redeem him next year but chelsea said no because they wanted a full acquisition
6708140 my body is still in good condition i have no problems
6708141 hes experienced but not good he doesnt know anything about fair play the spectators saw that but not the judges and thats the only thing that matters
6708142 hes not an olympic champion he doesnt deserve to be

6708150 we would love to see samsung go for the gold to help consumers recycle but for now they havent done anything
6708151 samsung isnt the only electronics company doing something wrong they just happen to be the market leader
6708152 samsung has numerous take back and recycle initiatives throughout the company including the s t a r toner recycling program for printer cartridges and the samsung mobile take back and recycling program for end of life mobile devices
6708153 piloting television take back and recycling programs in 14 u s states
6708154 i think garrett has handled this the best he possibly could
6708155 he realizes people know who he is he doesnt try to spruce himself up and let people know who he is
6708156 really i just try to take it as it comes and try not to buy too much into it
6708157 i dont really pay attention to it at all because its all hype and potential and whatnot and it doesnt matter at all
6708158 garrett gilbert can absolutely not dance he cannot dance at all
6708159 i think its interesting that everyone talked about how we win all the time and no one could compete
6708160 it was proven today that teams can the sport should remain its global its international its been a beautiful last two weeks of softball
6708161 honestly i havent even thought about the big picture the loss just hurts too much right now to think about the future
6708162 id take away two pitches the double and the home run those were the only two balls they really hit solid and they just happened to do that at the right time but i felt good
6708163 the first rbi wasnt a hard hit ball it just went to the right spot where we couldnt make a play
6708164 were devastated at the decision at the same time we know that there is still hope we went through our mourning period and anger and frustration with the decision but weve moved forward its over for now but its not for good
6708165 changes in the game just since i played have been substantial
6708166 back then high school players never heard of summer football camps the reads quarterbacks and receivers have to make in the wide open passing attacks we have now were also well in the future
6708167 is a lot more sophisticated theres more mental stuff than there was back then
6708168 i was an option quarterback mostly in the wishbone and didnt throw much we did a lot in spring training and maybe a few things in a voluntary summer gym program but if there were specialized summer camps like college coaches run now i never heard about them
6708169 it was held in late june or early july and was helpful and affordable for high school players here in austin but it wasnt specialized
6708170 everybody in it backs linemen whatever all did the same things lifting and running
6708171 players in general seem to be a lot bigger now than they were then
6708172 somebody 6 foot 3 and 230 pounds back then was considered big now almost every high school team has several that height or taller and 250 or heavier
6708173 every major change in the rules has benefited the offense theres more holding allowed
6708174 protective orders which govern the exchange of information outside of a public docket are obtained pursuant to a good cause standards
6708175 when such information is filed with a court however it becomes part of a public document subject to the right of public access absent showing a compelling justification and a clearly defined and serious injury
6708176 took place so long ago that there is no likely reason their disclosure would cause competitive disadvantage
6708177 we provide the benchmarks and template vms for some workloads the run rules and reporting rules the vendors run it themselves and if they need help with tuning our engineers can help
6708178 when a vendor is ready to submit a result they send vmware a results package we review it to make sure they used a proper and sound methodology and we post it if it is appropriate
6708179 the intention of vmmark is that customers can look at the results and make decisions based on what they see it isnt just about the fastest server its about making system comparisons between blades and rackmounts or a two core or four core system someone can see how much more performance they get from upgrading to four core processors for instance
6708180 there is a need for this benchmark because we can consolidate so many servers onto virtual machines and have no real way to tell how much overhead there actually is
6708181 mozilla firefox 3 limits usable encrypted ssl websites to those who are willing to pay money to one of their approved digital certificate vendors this policy is bad for the web
6708182 it was a very close knit with one ideal to help the jews
6708183 he got really angry but i told him if youre angry we wont make a deal
6708184 he went out there and risked his neck in actual negotiations
6708185 weve all got a kind of love hate relationship with the university of washington
6708186 affects the health safety or security of any member of the university community or the mission of the university
6708187 we have a responsibility to educate our students about being responsible citizens
6708188 i think weve made huge strides in calming the place
6708189 the conditions at the site are quite rough because of the waste and there is also the remnants of the wet weather so it is quite a difficult search to carry out
6708190 police were first informed of the missing man shortly before 8pm last night
6708191 they are liaising closely with a number of other agencies including the northern ireland fire and rescue service and the health and safety executive because of the conditions
6708192 these are three powerful performers and i would expect top class displays from them all
6708193 obviously we are looking to lowry who still has a chance of winning british supersport championship for he is in third place with four rounds left
6708194 ive had an awful season with more breakdowns than ive had finishes
6708195 i thought i was going to turn the corner at the ulster but the deluge came
6708196 my next outing after cadwell will probably be in the shell gold cup races at scarborough
6708197 i have had five wins in the main event and thats a record
6708198 however the way things are at present i dont give myself any chance
6708199 there is also a practical issue in that the actual debating chamber is not available because of refurbishment work and we would have had to meet probably in the great hall
6708200 we have a credit crunch the economy is slowing down people are being laid off and we are heading rapidly for a deep fuel poverty crisis as soon as the cold weather comes back but where is the executive nowhere from june to september the first minister is either unable or afraid to call the ministers together in one room
6708201 last week we had the worst floods in human memory but there was no emergency executive meeting
6708202 the floods showed why we need joined up government and all departments working together to solve problems people with water and sewage coming in their door if they could get through on the phone at all were being questioned about where the water was coming from and which department or agency it belonged to a first minister who cant even call a meeting has suffered a serious loss of authority
6708203 we are talking about making click4carbon their entry point to the internet
6708204 they can use it as their home page or we can give them code to embed it in their intranet or website allowing them to help fund carbon reduction projects when they search
6708205 in spite of economic constraints in some markets like the us on a worldwide basis servers continued to grow in the second quarter of the year
6708206 the most significant driver in the quarter continued to be an upswing in x86 server replacements that started in the first quarter coupled with web data center build outs and growth in emerging markets has produced solid second quarter results
6708207 risc itanium unix servers fell 7 9 in shipments but grew 9 4 in revenues indicating that higher end systems were the hardware platforms that drove sales in this space
6708208 some guys will look at it as an incentive to make up for last year other guys may think differently every guy is different its important to beat kerry at croke park we havent done it thats glaringly obvious its a standout thing its very important to us
6708209 that was a bad time but you learn as much as you can you just move on we have a chance on sunday to get to an all ireland final and we want to take it
6708210 lets just say i dont think kerry have many chinks in their armour one of their main things in the last few years is if a game isnt going their way they seem to be able to open the bench and release their depth
6708211 in tough games theyve come through their bench has helped them in that way
6708212 they are very focussed they know what they have to do
6708213 we cannot afford to take any chances its a major mission for us
6708214 we are seeing global acceleration in the inevitable convergence between mobile devices and financial services
6708215 our goal over the coming year is to at least maintain the current rate of revenue growth overall cash overheads are anticipated to be in the region of 14m subject to potential additional investment in new territories during the year there are a number of new opportunities opened up b y the partners participating in our fundraising and our investment focus will be on those markets with the strongest commercial potential
6708216 in the year since demerger monitise has continued to develop
6708217 what weve added is a lot of consumer oriented features for the dynamic energy economy things that allow meters and thermostats to work together or balance each other or allow a display in a house to tell you how much energy you used
6708218 for the first time in a decade belarus does not have any political prisoners
6708219 its in that future that machines from intel will surpass human intelligence
6708220 and progress in next hundred years will be more like the progress of last 20 000 years of human history because of technology
6708221 well need new materials to improve transistor performance and new technologies like tri gate transistors trigate gives you more power lower leakage and better density
6708222 cmos will be the platform of the processor and then well have other things on top of that
6708223 wireless radios dont work together in fact they fight each other
6708224 det finns blanketter d r n gonstans det tar fjorton dagar att fylla i dem sen tar det fjorton dagar f r oss att behandla dem och sen tar det fjorton dagar f r oss att fatta v rt beslut och sen tar det fjorton dagar f r er att fatta vad vi har fattat f r beslut
6708225 this regulation is not about contraception it is about abortion and conscience
6708226 it was terrifying the smell of smoke was overpowering it was thick and rancid mum led me out
6708227 we were on the fourth floor and i have to say the firemen were magnificent in evacuating the place were thanking our lucky stars that we came through it
6708228 we were led down four flights of stairs and were coughing our lungs out when we reached the street i had the presence of mind to grab our passports some money and coats but we had to spend the next couple of days dressed in coats and our pyjamas as the shops were closed
6708229 we spent two nights in the foyer of a second hotel and then we were transferred to a third one we didnt get much sleep
6708230 i was one of the first of the disabled skiers there
6708231 only three of us arrived early englishman stephen armstrong who is blind irishman eamon prunty who is in a wheelchair and myself
6708232 wed managed to buy new clothes by then and luckily i had met an italian skiing friend when we arrived at the airport and he took all my sports equipment out to the lake venue and i was able to practice and compete
6708233 but there was no way i was going to pull out after all that drama and i went ahead with it strapped up
6708234 i didnt win any medals but as ever the experience was excellent and will stand me in good stead for next years world championships
6708235 its been a horrific week but im used to that sort of thing ill be delighted to get home
6708236 the reality is that in terms of the last number of years it is irrelevant next sunday is a different game theyre may be different players involved to some extent what has gone before has no relevance
6708237 what has happened in the past is history the way i see it is that im looking forward now i believe were going to be ready and focused for sunday
6708238 for the kildare match we wouldnt be the first team to get caught in that situation we were very dominant at the start and looked composed we got a bit ragged and started taking wrong options
6708239 that happens and its disappointing it was a difficult game for us to motivate ourselves for we were very much aware that we were on a hiding there
6708240 were not the finished article and were well aware of that but the reality is that no team puts it together for 70 minutes
6708241 what we would accept is that we need to put it together for a longer period i do think weve a lot of positives
6708242 weve a lot of fighting spirit in the team and thats been proved to date in the championship thats a serious quality to have
6708243 its nice to have that in your pocket heading into an all ireland semi final of this magnitutde
6708244 if president mugabe goes ahead to convene parliament and appoint a new cabinet it means he is proceeding to violate the conditions of the memorandum of understanding which means he may have abandoned the basis for the talks but we dont know what his intentions are
6708245 a violation of the mou will have to be dealt with by the mediator
6708246 would it be ok for me to use trimsecrets your new slimming product as i am taking 150mg of thyroxine tablets daily
6708247 we know that we are up against us but my boys have been showing plenty of spirit and skill lately we won the round robin ulster championship and those matches have helped to build our teamwork
6708248 she didnt want to go out she was frightened and scared so much by what happened
6708249 on the eve of her 21st birthday she went to the shop for some milk and when she came home a man followed her into the house and tried to grab her on the stairs
6708250 she managed to fight him off we spent the morning of her 21st birthday in the police station i didnt think she would get over it
6708251 we have told the children that their mummy has gone to sleep she will be missed so much
6708252 we anticipate the support for todays stoppage to be as strong as previous strikes so would advise the public to avoid taking to the sea for non essential activities
6708253 strike action is a last resort for our members who provide an invaluable service in ensuring the safety of shipping in british waters the latest action could have been avoided if the government and the mca hadnt continued with their refusal to negotiate a satisfactory outcome
6708254 members have rightly grown angry at the scandalous refusal to pay them the same as other emergency service workers and by the governments policy to cap public sector pay increases below inflation this has led to watch assistants having to receive a special pay rise simply to bring them up to the level of the national minimum wage
6708255 the agency is absolutely committed to maintaining the safety of life at sea detailed contingency plans will be in place and although our services will be more limited than usual the public should know that distress calls will be answered as normal
6708256 every single time he was granted bail he broke the conditions
6708257 there must be a point where the court says tough
6708258 on the basis that if he breaches again he will be in custody
6708259 it seems in these circumstances the courts have been overly generous to this man
6708260 there is a presumption of bail pending trial for any defendant except in very grave circumstances given the severity of the crime and also given the risk to witnesses or the risk of reoffending in this case it is obvious the police are very concerned about him reoffending or breaching bail it seems strange that the district judge gave him the benefit of the doubt and permitted him bail
6708261 police do not take a decision lightly to object to bail they object to bail for good reason when they have cause for concern that the suspect may reoffend or break the conditions imposed by the courts of course we cannot remand every single offender or alleged offender in custody and there are a number of factors for the courts to consider but i think the courts should take more notice when police do object to bail
6708262 it is up to players themselves and their families and clubs to make decisions concerning their futures but we would have concerns that they are being poached prematurely
6708263 we believe that a lot of clubs put great emphasis on coaching and drilling players and it seems unfair that clubs in another code should benefit from all this endeavour and commitment
6708264 good morning everyone there are a number of good stories today theres the data loss story and we also have a good interview on the olympics developments in pakistan look interesting do come to the morning meeting with ideas on these stories and any others you think we should be doing and lets keep an eye obama who is expected to name his vice presidential running mate today robert
6708265 it was originally the name of a song that one of the guys had written
6708266 and its very personal to him so i dont talk about the meaning of it
6708267 he didnt feel comfortable as a singer as he was more of a screamer when the band was into a lot heavier rock then when i joined we changed and went the opposite way
6708268 were not the type of band thats politically driven where that is our message
6708269 but with the war the recession and seeing what the president has done to the economy its given us more of a political consciousness and at this point when youre talking about government you just pick the lesser of two evils
6708270 weve learned a lot from some of the acts weve opened for
6708271 especially the deftones korn and disturbed have been great to us embraced us and gave us pointers
6708272 we take our work very professionally and try to be the best we can be onstage
6708273 take off accidents are very very rare you reach a point in take off when it is unlikely that anything can go wrong but if things do go wrong they can go wrong very quickly
6708274 on take off pilots reach a point of no return known as v1 speed which is usually reached about two seconds before take off
6708275 if you go above v1 and abort the take off there is insufficient room at the end of the runway and there is the chance of going off the end of the runway at a very fast speed and things can then go very badly wrong
6708276 the normal rule is that if you go beyond v1 and something goes wrong you take off anyway if for example a tyre blew you would take off
6708277 a problem at the point of take off is very challenging for the pilot if something happens at the point of v1 he is committed to taking off
6708278 if there is an engine failure at this point he is flying an aircraft at very low speed
6708279 planes that you or i are likely to find ourselves on dont crash
6708280 we had reached an agreement with everton for the loan of tiago all that was needed was the players agreement and that never came
6708281 we take it therefore that tiago will stay with us
6708282 the market remains closed to us regarding players coming in like we already said some time ago now
6708283 martin is the captain here i didnt say it officially to him but he is the captain of the side at the moment and i wouldnt see that changing
6708284 he leads by example im not saying he is running around shouting all over the place then but neither did gareth
6708285 he had this long term knee problem and it could have led to him giving up football but he showed his strength of character to battle back
6708286 he came back into the side for the final stretch of the season before last when we had a long unbeaten finish and since then has not looked back he has been excellent for us
6708287 tottenham fans are no exception to any others they support the team and get behind the side
6708288 if a player is on form if he knocks in a couple of goals then im sure anyone who booed him last week will soon be getting behind him and cheering him that is what it is like
6708289 while he is still here he is very much 100 per cent a tottenham player that is how we consider things
6708290 it is not a case of finding a solution to a problem before it occurs
6708291 weve got a list of targets that we are working very hard on
6708292 negotiations are tough and sometimes they are even tougher than usual we know what we are working towards and we know what our objectives are
6708293 the process of signing players sometimes takes time but fans should be aware we are trying to strengthen up front and sign a new forward quite often these things take time
6708294 the second estimate clearly increases the already strong chances that the economy will fall into recession over the coming quarters things will be considerably worse in 2009
6708295 the uk like other economies is seeing the consequences of globally high commodity prices as well as the uncertainty in the credit markets
6708296 she has made a huge contribution to the success of our womens 4x400m relay squad in recent years
6708297 i love cadwell park its a wonderful and very special track for me the layout is exciting theres the thrill of the jump over the mountain and its glorious to race there even if it is a little narrow
6708298 i took my first supersport win there a few years back and i hope one day to carry that success through to the superbike class too its also a track where its very important to hm plant honda to do well as our team hq and workshop is in louth just down the road
6708299 the weather is looking ok for the weekend which is positive
6708300 francois was due to drive a focus rs wrc for the stobart team in spain and corsica
6708301 his abilities on asphalt are well known to us from his time as a works ford driver from 2002 to 2004 and this decision will strengthen our line up for those two rallies
6708302 a third consecutive manufacturers world title is our aim this season and francois experience of these two specialised rallies will maximise our chances of obtaining strong results
6708303 im delighted that malcolm has the confidence to nominate me for the bp ford abu dhabi team
6708304 after several seasons with ford previously im comfortable with the set up here
6708305 youre doing this new thing what got you started doing that or why do that
6708306 bolak balik kita tangkap kita serahkan kabur lagi cari saja sendiri dulu
6708307 penangkapan semula itu kan di beijing oleh kbri jadi ketika diserahkan dan diproses kemudian kabur lagi jangan minta tolong lagi dong
6708308 davids worked there since he was 17 years old hes site supervisor they work six days a week and hes always been there on site hes never late for work hes the most reliable person there
6708309 we have always known that this part of the world is very rich in prehistoric remains
6708310 but the sheer number of new finds exposed by the fire is the most exciting development in archaeology in my experience
6708311 det er meningen at sagen skal fore l gges objektivt hvad du selv mener m vente til senere
6708312 small production engenders capitalism and the bourgeoisie continuously daily hourly spontaneously and on a mass scale
6708313 and it is precisely to enable us to go by marxism and not revisionism in both theory and practice that chairman mao calls on the whole nation to get clear on the question of the dictatorship of the proletariat
6708314 lack of clarity on this question will lead to revisionism
6708315 the dictatorship of the proletariat is a most determined and most ruthless war waged by the new class against a more powerful enemy the bourgeoisie whose resistance is increased tenfold by its overthrow even if only in one country and whose power lies not only in the strength of international capital in the strength and durability of the international connections o the bourgeoisie but also in the force of habit in the strength of small production for unfortunately small production is still very very widespread in the world and small production engenders capitalism and the bourgeoisie continuously daily hourly spontaneously and on a mass scale for all these reasons the dictatorship of the proletariat is essential
6708316 the satellites went up to the sky while the red flag fell to the ground
6708317 in a word china is a socialist country before liberation she was much the same as a capitalist country even now she practises an eight grade wage system distribution according to work and exchange through money and in all this differs very little from the old society what is different is that the system of ownership has been changed
6708318 apparently we couldnt do without the great proletarian cultural revolution for our base was not solid from m observations i am afraid that in a fairly large majority of factories i dont mean all or the overwhelming majority leadership was not in the hands of real marxists and the masses of workers not that there were no good people in the leadership of the factories there were there were good people among the secretaries deputy secretaries and members of party committees and among the party branch secretaries but they followed that line of liu just resorting to material incentive putting profit in command and instead of promoting proletarian politics handing out bonuses and so forth
6708319 our country at present practises a commodity system the wage system is unequal too as in the eight grade wage scale and so forth under the dictatorship of the proletariat such things can only be restricted therefore if people like lin piao come to power it will be quite easy for them to rig up the capitalist system
6708320 under the dictatorship of the proletariat such things can only be restricted
6708321 everything reactionary is the same if you dont hit it it wont fall it is like sweeping the floor where the broom does not reach the dust never vanishes of itself
6708322 for all these reasons the dictatorship of the proletariat is essential
6708323 no credit is due to me for discovering the existence of classes in modern society nor yet the struggle between them long before me bourgeois historians had described the historical development of this struggle of the classes and bourgeois economists the economic anatomy of the classes what i did that was new was to prove 1 that the existence of classes is only bound up with particular historical phases in the development of production 2 that the class struggle necessarily leads to the dictatorship of the proletariat 3 that this dictatorship itself only constitutes the transition to the abolition of all classes and to a classless society

6708338 this is a terrible predicament for a family who loves their adoptive children ms keech said
6708339 adoption services queensland asq will offer any assistance it can to indian federal and state agencies investigating the claims
6708340 we were not aware of the child kidnap allegations until last year asq conducted an audit of indian children who were adopted into queensland between 1995 and 2007
6708341 the adoption of the queensland child who was allegedly stolen was authorised by the madras high court in march 2000 she said
6708342 i am aware of allegations regarding child trafficking and share concerns for the safety of children adopted from overseas mr mcclelland said
6708343 i have asked my department to make direct contact with the indian authorities and provide me with a brief on any potential legal issues arising in india and australia
6708344 i will ensure that any matters arising are duly acted upon by my department and where relevant are passed on for states and territories to implement

6708346 how can this trait be made in one gender and not the other
6708347 males and females basically have the same set of genes so how do you specifically modify the activity of a males genes but not a females genes
6708348 the flies did not need new genes to make a new pattern
6708349 they just changed how males and females use a common set of genes
6708350 the switch existed for tens of millions of years because it had a different job but it got remodeled
6708351 with this particular trait it evolved by exploiting genetic information that was already there to make male bodies different from female bodies
6708352 if female tastes change these traits go away there is no reinforcement
6708353 the approach is a new application of the well known botanical phenomenon of aerial root development instead of using plant branches this patented approach takes malleable roots and shapes them into useful objects for indoors and out
6708354 the impact of climate change on human and global security could extend far beyond the limited scope the world has seen thus far
6708355 water supplies stored in glaciers and snow cover in major mountain ranges such as the andes and himalayas also are expected to decrease
6708356 most critical for human survival are water and food which are sensitive to changing climatic conditions
6708357 environmental changes caused by global warming will not only affect human living conditions but may also generate larger societal effects by threatening the infrastructures of society or by inducing social responses that aggravate the problem
6708358 the associated socio economic and political stress can undermine the functioning of communities the effectiveness of institutions and the stability of societal structures these degraded conditions could contribute to civil strife and worse armed conflict
6708359 large areas of africa are suffering from scarcity of food and fresh water resources making them more vulnerable to conflict
6708360 other regions of the world including the middle east central asia and south america also are being affected
6708361 sperm whales go to where their food source is and that means very deep water so folks that do see them are marine mammal observers who ride the seismic survey vessels and the workers on the big oil and gas rigs and even that does not happen often
6708362 the bottom line is that air gun noise from seismic surveys that are thousands of yards distant does not drive away sperm whales living in the gulf
6708363 the data was held in a secure format on the contractors site it was downloaded on to a memory stick for processing purposes which has since been lost
6708364 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost the data loss reinforces the need for data protection to be taken seriously at all levels
6708365 this is a massive failure of duty it is not the first time that the government has been shown to be completely incapable of protecting the integrity of highly sensitive data
6708366 deeply disappointing that a loss of this kind had happened yet again
6708367 what is also worrying is that a separate organisation was involved in looking at this data
6708368 one would expect the home office to have this data but if you hand out memory sticks almost like confetti to companies that are meant to do research for you then you need to be absolutely certain that when you give such information away the company concerned have put into practice procedures that are just as robust as the procedures that i hope the government has followed since the loss of the child benefit discs
6708369 ive written to jacqui smith today to say i am deeply disappointed with whats happened in the view of what ministers have said to the select committee
6708370 one of the problems is that it is very hard to get rid of people who are not doing their jobs properly
6708371 once you get into the government civil service youre virtually unsackable no matter how incompetent you actually are
6708372 i think jacqui smith is going to have to do a lot of explaining to the home affairs select committee when we go back in october
6708373 you know that was the beginning of a real positive change in my life
6708374 we expect to use the robotic arm heavily over the next several weeks delivering samples to our instruments and examining trench floors and walls to continue to search for evidence of lateral and vertical variations in soil and ice structures
6708375 history is hidden in this ancient city we have so far found many things and this is the beginning of excavations
6708376 when the work finishes we will have significant information about the history of city structures of that period
6708377 the research raises the perception both of how common these events are and specifically where they may occur
6708378 today with so many more buildings and people a magnitude 5 centered below the city would be extremely attention getting
6708379 wed see billions in damage with some brick buildings falling people would probably be killed
6708380 they can pick up the standalone version of world tour and use those instruments and when they break they can buy ours
6708381 im not a huge fan of trying to punish your consumer
6708382 albeit these people have clearly stolen intellectual property i think there are better ways of resolving this within our power as developers and publishers
6708383 we absolutely should crack down on piracy people put a lot of blood sweat and tears into their content and deserve to get paid for it its absolutely wrong it is stealing
6708384 but at the same time i think there are better solutions than chasing people for money
6708385 these two contracts have proved a significant boost to our activity in asia
6708386 you cant call yourselves the doors because you cant have the doors without jim morrison

6708401 the book you are about to read deals with what i believe to be the most serious crime ever committed in american history the president of the nation george w bush knowingly and deliberately taking this country to war in iraq under false presences a war that condemned over 100 000 human beings including 4 000 american soldiers to horrific violent deaths

6708416 this account is currently suspended and is being investigated due to strange activity
6708417 we must be careful because a criminal case should be seen from two aspects for us to move on it we value the statement but we must be professional
6708418 we cant talk much about this case yet it is still an opinion we must be careful and we will collect the evidence
6708419 if we did we would not have let it happen
6708420 parties should play a greater role in preventing lawmakers from abusing their power including taking bribes there should be political contracts between the parties and their representatives in the house

6708426 based on the facts found in the trial the defendant gave the money to al amin under a threat
6708427 it was al amin not the defendant who took the initiative by demanding money to expedite the issuance of the forest conversion permit
6708428 my client originally rejected the demand saying the request was exorbitant
6708429 since the defendant opted to violate the law by giving the money to al amin he should be held responsible for his actions

6708431 he was a very good player for us for a while
6708432 probably our best player for a long time so id like to see him get back to that
6708433 and similar to his legs it was getting better but not to where he wants it to be
6708434 he never throws a ball over the middle of the plate
6708435 if you face him four or five times in a game you might get one pitch over the plate i mean he goes corner to corner as good as any pitcher in the game i said it before hes probably the best starter in baseball i would think hes as consistent as anyone
6708436 you throw an all star team out there today it wouldnt have done much with halladay
6708437 its kind of tough to say were struggling offensively weve faced some good pitchers but today i really dont think it made a difference
6708438 youre getting one of the best pitchers in all of baseball youve got to find a way to beat him and keep it close doc doesnt like to hand the ball to anyone else either he wants to go nine innings every time he goes out there
6708439 those are the guys that we have to rely on every time they go out there as a ballclub we need them to do well and theyve been stepping up to the mound and doing it every single time
6708440 they have been giving us a chance to win and thats what you want from your no 1 and no 2 guys
6708441 as far as we are concerned negotiations continue over the technical service contract

6708457 i do this every day i do this well every day
6708458 im not bragging im not boasting im not trying to talk myself up i do this well every day i train with the best in the world every time i race every time i line up im a contender and today i simply was not
6708459 it motivates me because i thought i deserved to be on the podium today and i did not do an effort that was worthy of even a final in my mind

6708465 i dont think it was a commodity bubble but there was speculative excess in commodities that caused the market to move up too quickly
6708466 that doesnt really alter the big picture which is that commodities have established themselves as an asset class and that global demand for them will continue to be strong even though we had some demand destruction obviously in the energy sector due to high prices
6708467 the weak dollar is a major factor in the commodities markets today
6708468 just half of that the rest of the season would be great
6708469 youre not going to score a lot of runs off of him him and burnett

6708475 in this regard the role of the kznpac is critical to lead the monitoring and evaluation for the implementation of the provincial aids strategy and the targets set out by the south african national aids council
6708476 we understand that in order to create an enabling working environment and a healthier society it is important that men and women work together to further advance gender equity as enshrined in our democratic constitution
6708477 this imperative is about men and women being given equal opportunities rights and resources to enable them to realise their full potential
6708478 i am sure that a number of fans will be coming to south africa some of them will be first time visitors we need to be there to give them an experience and ensure they come back with their families and friends
6708479 tourism sa is in the process of linking 2010 to a range of other tourism experiences throughout the country and the sadc southern african development community region

6708482 i just wanted the tribe to say yes we recognize that you are just as important as any other tribe member and we will treat you and your spouse as we treat all tribal members

6708484 for our tribe we want people to walk in the shoes of other people and learn to respect differences
6708485 weve all got a kind of love hate relationship with the university of washington

6708526 developing national state and local obesity prevention policies present one of our greatest opportunities to prevent and reduce one of the primary causes of chronic disease
6708527 it is now clear that a future without significant investment in prevention will include devastating health and economic consequences
6708528 actions by state health departments and their partners are producing promising results in communities related to the two most important areas for obesity prevention increasing physical activity and healthy eating
6708529 but a lack of funding for health promotion and disease prevention is cited by state health department respondents as a major barrier to preventing and treating obesity in their states

6708547 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6708548 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6708549 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6708550 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6708551 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6708552 if you trust every web site but not a government
6708553 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate

6708559 since the prisoner khodorkovsky had no connection with the professional educational programme offered him in detention he does not deserve conditional early release
6708560 levels of activity in 2008 should match those seen in 2007 and there are significant new business opportunities at both the network and parent company levels
6708561 spending behind the united states presidential election and around the beijing olympic games should continue to boost 2008 revenues as well as some clients taking the view that our research supports that the cost of cutting brand spending at this stage of the cycle is too costly in the long term
6708562 prospects for 2009 remain less certain particularly if the united states and western european economies continue to be impacted by the financial crisis and commodity price increases

6708565 this adds the element of engagement something closer to making brands part of the conversation
6708566 in the last week or so the number of people getting in touch has shot up suggesting that august is the time when many people consider ending a relationship
6708567 many of us find it easiest to express a difficult message in writing which is why we think so many people feel there is a gap in the market for this type of card
6708568 they are large panels of knitting that are almost like a big blanket wrapped around the tree trunks
6708569 i think people will really like it weve made them in the brightest colours that we can get hold of we are hoping they are going to be tactile so people will want to touch them not just look at them
6708570 theyre not guilty of any crime they were just citizen journalists
6708571 these people of conscience from many walks of life were here to make sure the tibetan issue was at the forefront during these olympics games

6708577 i have my own style and i hope to inspire others rather than aspire to be like someone else
6708578 ill probably spend the prize money on shoes and hats

6708580 hopefully ill have a career as a choreographer but i enjoy boxing as well so im going to keep working on both

6708613 during the run phase of the exercise a present day air campaign is replicated in which the aggressors f 16 and f 15s are the air to air and air to ground threats to the blue land and its forces
6708614 surface to air missiles sams such as sa2 sa3 sa6 and sa8 along with long and short range quick reaction missiles are always present to neutralize the friendly blue forces the red land always keeps shifting their sam sites making it difficult for the blue forces
6708615 an interesting aspect of the air war between the red and the blue forces is that the aggressors use all possible means to gather intelligence from the blue forces
6708616 wo h rt mittelstand auf und wo f ngt reichtum an

6708618 wenn wir jetzt an die sogenannten reichen denken dann fallen uns blicherweise eine handvoll leute ein die wirklich wirklich sehr reich sind leute mit hausangestellten leute mit soviel geld dass sie wie mccain noch nicht mal mehr wissen wieviele h user sie besitzen
6708619 das problem ist dass wir zu glauben scheinen jeder der nicht per se

6708657 ich sehe interaktive systeme als eines der megathemen der zukunft
6708658 the trick with wireless power is not can you do it its can you do it safely and efficiently
6708659 it turns out the human body is not affected by magnetic fields it is affected by elective fields so what we are doing is transmitting energy using the magnetic field not the electric field
6708660 initially it eliminates chargers and eventually it eliminates batteries all together
6708661 that is potentially a world changing event this is the closest weve had to something being commercially available in this class
6708662 its great that we have wireless email and wireless internet and stuff like that but at the end of the day it would be nice to have wireless recharge as well
6708663 but there are only old men there if young people go then it is recorded straight away the soviet times have come back
6708664 the young guys say that if someone new goes to friday prayer the old people take him to the police
6708665 especially if he has a beard then hes a wahhabi an extremist a bandit to them a young muslim is a potential terrorist
6708666 if there is a muslim opposition now it keeps its convictions extremely well hidden
6708667 the jamaat has become vulnerable they could be detained at any time so they cant make any pronouncements
6708668 land has already been allocated for two the president said he would give money
6708669 declare with authority that no one is persecuted for being a muslim and going to mosque
6708670 every state must have law enforcement agencies and thats their job if youre law abiding whats the problem let them monitor im certain that in other countries every mosque and not only muslims but protestants orthodox is also watched because thats the role of the state its the states prerogative in order to defend it must know everything
6708671 just as soon as he stops praying five times a day
6708672 always trying to become autonomous forces separate from political control and the people
6708673 this work was more significant for the club because anybody could have stepped in and taken my place on the pitch that day but this was about moving forward
6708674 i played for wealdstone as a supporter and i still support them now thats what this clubs about a lot of people from a long time ago still find it important
6708675 there are too many clubs in this area all at a relatively similar level and all swimming against the tide
6708676 only the healthiest clubs will survive those that have financial investment and are well run as football clubs and community organisations
6708677 i think some people thought we were just going for another ground share but the catalytic moment was when the main stand was painted blue people came in and saw they were our colours knowing its your friends who have grafted make you realise that youre part of this club
6708678 quite frankly i think this proves the only method that works is enforcement
6708679 they want amnesty they want open borders and they want a more vulnerable america
6708680 my hope is it isnt going to empower them or fuel their enforcement even further
6708681 why are they going to go back to their country and pay someone to bring them over here again
6708682 people should not be forced to say or do things they believe are morally wrong
6708683 healthcare workers should not be forced to provide services that violate their own conscience
6708684 words in that draft led some to misconstrue the departments intent
6708685 this regulation is consistent with my intent to focus squarely on the issue of conscience rights this specifically goes to the issue of abortion and conscience
6708686 this regulation does not seek to resolve any ambiguity in that area it focuses on abortion and focuses on physicians conscience in relation to that
6708687 i think this provides broad application not just to abortion and sterilization but any other type of morally objectionable procedure and research activity we think its badly needed our members are facing discrimination every day and as we get into human cloning and all sorts of possibilities its going to become even more important

6708838 levels of activity in 2008 should match those seen in 2007 and there are significant new business opportunities
6708839 the prospects for 2009 remain less certain particularly if the united states and western european economies continue to be impacted by the financial crisis and commodity price increases
6708840 in addition the new united states president will have to wrestle with twin fiscal and budget deficits in early 2009 and post the olympics chinese growth may slow due to inflationary particularly food price concerns and the impact that a weakening united states economy has on the rest of the world

6708844 a fascinating examination of gods sovereignty and human free will
6708845 what does it mean to submit your physical bodies to gods sovereign care
6708846 for me using hormonal birth control indicates that i dont really trust god with every area of my life
6708847 it is an effort on my part to control something that i really believe god can be trusted with
6708848 shown that we had a lot to learn about nfp and that there is a dark side we werent aware of
6708849 i feel like it really works in harmony with the way that god designed our bodies to work
6708850 in contrast with the pill which works by altering and suppressing our natural systems and murdering the innocent babies nfp works by supporting those systems in harmony with their functions it goes with the flow so to speak there is a wisdom and a rightness to that which i really appreciate
6708851 crazy or irresponsible to consider not being on the pill

6708863 you know weve worked hard the last 20 years how would we ever start over
6708864 i dont look at what blagojevich says any more i look at what he does

6708867 i just wanted the tribe to say yes we recognize that you are just as important as any other tribe member and we will treat you and your spouse as we treat all tribal members

6708888 what did the big chimney say to the little chimney
6708889 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humor in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker

6708902 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6708903 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6708904 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6708905 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing

6708992 what has concerned us is the violence the disruptions that has led us to be concerned about the safety of our employees our equipment and investment and of the viability of the process
6708993 if anybody is under the impression that because we have made this very large investment of 1 500 crore rupees 350 million that we would not move then they are wrong because we would move to protect our people

6708998 cloud computing is one of those catch all buzz words that tries to encompass a variety of aspects ranging from deployment load balancing provisioning business model and architecture like web2
6708999 i view cloud computing as a broad array of web based services aimed at allowing users to obtain a wide range of functional capabilities on a pay as you go basis that previously required tremendous hardware software investments and professional skills to acquire cloud computing is the realization of the earlier ideals of utility computing without the technical complexities or complicated deployment worries
6709000 i think clouds are the next hype term for the next year or two people are coming to grips with virtualization and how it reshapes it creates service and software based models and in many ways changes a lot of the physical layer we are used to clouds will be the next transformation over the next several years building off of the software models that virtualization enabled
6709001 russia in this case will have to react and not only through diplomatic protests
6709002 an attack upon one is an attack upon all and thats the strongest possible guarantee you can have

6709006 you just cant put forward concepts and knowledge relationships like flinging hash
6709007 no other structure is in the same league as the common sense basis of cyc weve found its knowledge framework to be flexible enough for any customer context
6709008 in the cyc project weve been working to develop the knowledge representations and reasoning capabilities for intelligent software that collaborates with its users although researchers have been using some of the results for a few years now the recent growth of the semantic web presented both a need and opportunity to have a dramatically greater impact opencyc is the language that can tie the disparate parts of the semantic web together
6709009 by representing and sharing knowledge in the same language semantic web applications can be enormously more powerful
6709010 common semantic vocabularies are the missing link for the semantic web blogs cover an incredible range of subjects so meaning based content integration using the huge opencyc ontology can provide an amazing user experience for bloggers and other content authors
6709011 if someone is interested in a product information about components of that product may be relevant
6709012 if someone is interested in a product component they may be interested in a companys competitors which also rely on that component
6709013 we think that a rich ontology like opencyc can enable us to extend iglue with new information or to validate the existing data using logical inference and it has the potential to provide a base for a common semantic infrastructure as a sort of entity yellow pages
6709014 with rising unemployment and negative real wage growth being intensified by the latest hike in utility bills our technical recession view is looking more plausible
6709015 we believe that the bank will be more aggressive in its easing policy with rates down to 3 50 by the second half of 2009

6709041 scenes take place in bedrooms a bar and in church accompanied by familiar hymns childrens church songs and various sermons
6709042 throughout it all there are bible passages that support contradict and call into question fundamentalist teachings about homosexuality
6709043 the first act is a comedy the second act is a drama tragedy ending in hopefulness it talks about how thechurch unfortunately teaches children who are gay to hate themselves
6709044 what we have been discussing in brussels in preparation to accra is that on part of the partner countries are not all that positively interested in division of labor because they fear maybe and that is my translation that this will decrease opportunities for them

6709052 a priest is ordained with the privilege of celebrating the churchs sacraments by nothing less than a holy order
6709053 the behaviors attributable to certain priests involved in this matter not only betray those holy orders but diminish the stature of the faithful and responsible priests who dispatch their ministry effectively and faithfully day in day out
6709054 i have been devastated to have been falsely accused in the media without evidence of horrible acts and i fully expect a thorough unbiased and professional investigation to clear me of any wrongdoing
6709055 im glad to see this is settled but i feel sad though
6709056 although we may apologize for any responsibility the diocese might have had for its insensitivity to conditions that may have created the opportunity for these incidents we cannot change what may have happened in the past

6709103 we are very willing to tour pakistan we are very keen to do so and we will visit pakistan as long as the safety and security advisors say that it is safe

6709117 wir sch tzen unsere chancen auf dem markt gut ein sonst w rden wir nicht so stark expandieren
6709118 wir haben unsere unternehmensstrategie in den vergangenen monaten weiterhin konsequent umgesetzt und f hlen uns mit unserer einzigartigen positionierung in unseren gesch ftsbereichen concentrated solar power und photovoltaics bestens f r die zukunft und den kapitalmarkt ger stet
6709119 over the last seven weeks weve conceded more points than nearly anyone in the comp so i think the defensive group needs to really improve but also collectively we need to really be doing a lot of pressure through our midfield so the ball is not getting delivered through
6709120 we are under no illusion that defensively some players have been struggling
6709121 that is going to be a huge area for us tomorrow night and if we are any chance of winning the game our defensive group really has to stand up
6709122 its been a problem all year lapses in concentration teams have been able to score very heavily in ten minute periods as were shown last week against geelong
6709123 i will look to play next year i still feel really good in my body
6709124 i think we are at a delicate stage we have played a lot of young guys and got a few more games into them
6709125 a lot of our senior guys in some respects more are key position players so it will be an interesting transition
6709126 that will be resolved at the end of the season but all were focused on is the next couple of weeks and the finals campaign and the rest will look after itself
6709127 collectively weve definitely got a point to prove regardless of whether you are out of contract or youre old or youre young
6709128 i think everyone is sort of on notice at the moment the way that we have been playing is unacceptable and not up to the standard we really require of each player
6709129 i think it will really be determined on whether we turn up to play or not that will be the biggest factor on the result
6709130 i dont think port adelaide would want to lose to the bottom team i wouldnt have thought
6709131 i think choco williams has always been a very competitive bloke as i am and hopefully the game will be a really good spectacle and we get some people to come along
6709132 greg addressed the players before training and was quite emotional in terms of his thoughts and contribution to the club
6709133 thats a little bit more incentive for the players but youd be disappointed if youve got to wheel out michael wilson one week to get a good effort and then youve got to wheel out the president who is leaving the next week to get a good effort
6709134 wed like to think our players are better than that and can find some self motivation thats what we work on and we certainly dont want to be rolling out gimmicks each week
6709135 weve investigated as to some of the reasons for why its happened weve worked on it recently in training well work on it again in pre season but we believe the main reason is the confidence and the self belief of individuals
6709136 that was the best way it could have been done

6709200 when it comes to founders we know we are usually going to see something odd

6709202 we appeal to people to march to eidgah ground to remember and pay homage to martyrs
6709203 and to protest indian occupation and pray for kashmirs secession
6709204 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6709205 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

6709208 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6709209 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6709210 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6709211 he is now being placed under strict conditions on parole until completion of his sentence
6709212 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6709213 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6709214 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6709215 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6709216 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6709217 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6709218 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6709219 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6709220 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6709221 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6709222 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6709223 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6709224 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6709225 who are open to doing something on the production side
6709226 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6709227 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6709228 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6709229 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6709230 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6709231 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6709232 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6709233 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6709234 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6709235 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6709236 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6709237 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6709238 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6709239 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6709240 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6709241 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6709242 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6709243 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6709244 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6709245 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6709246 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6709247 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6709248 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6709249 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6709250 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6709251 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6709252 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6709253 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6709254 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6709255 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6709256 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6709257 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6709258 youre the most special child in the world to me and i love you so much

6709263 this is a terrible predicament for a family who loves their adoptive children ms keech said
6709264 adoption services queensland asq will offer any assistance it can to indian federal and state agencies investigating the claims
6709265 we were not aware of the child kidnap allegations until last year asq conducted an audit of indian children who were adopted into queensland between 1995 and 2007
6709266 the adoption of the queensland child who was allegedly stolen was authorised by the madras high court in march 2000 she said
6709267 i am aware of allegations regarding child trafficking and share concerns for the safety of children adopted from overseas mr mcclelland said
6709268 i have asked my department to make direct contact with the indian authorities and provide me with a brief on any potential legal issues arising in india and australia
6709269 i will ensure that any matters arising are duly acted upon by my department and where relevant are passed on for states and territories to implement
6709270 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6709271 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6709272 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6709273 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6709274 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6709275 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6709276 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6709277 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6709278 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6709279 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6709280 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6709281 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6709282 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6709283 there have been four adjournments in the last six months and the last three have all been marked final
6709284 i was instructed that unless i was handed a bankers draft for the full amount before the hearing i was to seek a bankruptcy order i have not been handed payment so i am seeking the order
6709285 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6709286 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6709287 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6709288 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6709289 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6709290 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6709291 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6709292 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6709293 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6709294 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6709295 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6709296 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6709297 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6709298 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6709299 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

6709313 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity

6709315 the newly appointed members have very strong credentials and having supported the governor and his party politically would certainly be a plus from his perspective

6709317 this is the third court in five years to find that the state of california has put at risk the access to health care for millions of californians by underfunding the medi cal program
6709318 hopefully lawmakers get the message that they cannot balance the budget on the backs of the states poor or those who provide their health care the state safety net needs to be strengthened not weakened
6709319 this decision is a critical step towards ensuring sufficient funding for medi cal but we still have a ways to go
6709320 california still ranks among the lowest states in the country on medi cal rates often reimbursing less than the cost of providing care
6709321 when patients who have a serious health emergency far from home are exposed to different healthcare systems high spending areas are associated with significantly lower mortality
6709322 i wanted to compare apples to apples and i found that the patients in high spending areas have higher survival rates than the ones in lower spending areas
6709323 typical comparison of a high spending area and a low spending one would represent a 50 difference in healthcare spending intensity such a disparity is associated with a 1 5 percentage point lower mortality rate among heart related emergency patients compared to a mortality of 6
6709324 i found that among local populations going to a teaching hospital was not associated with mortality possibly because these hospitals tend to treat sicker people however among tourists in an emergency situation going to a teaching hospital resulted in lower mortality
6709325 it looks like spending has an impact in terms of saving lives in emergency situations
6709326 there is a presumption that much of our healthcare spending is wasted
6709327 but high levels of spending may be justified because it also seems to increase survival rates in emergency situations
6709328 we fully support this campaign because the seeds of workable reform are planted in efforts like this diverse stakeholders from across the spectrum working together to find common ground

6709346 aggressive moves in financial aid at many highly selective institutions that for example have changed the landscape considerably
6709347 when a harvard education costs only 10 percent of family household income gone is the price advantage that selective public institutions have enjoyed in the past with some students
6709348 in previous years we determined that more enrolling women were in the top decile of their high school classes but enrolling men had slightly higher test scores on average
6709349 we had many students in our regular decision pool who in a prior year would have been admitted to harvard university princeton university or the university of virginia during the early round and would not have continued with their applications to william and mary
6709350 of course its great for us to have the opportunity to recruit such students but their presence in the pool inevitably makes it more challenging to predict who will accept our offers of admission

6709409 given the shoot first and ask questions later approach some content owners take to the dmca notice process improper takedowns of non infringing fair uses are all too common
6709410 we are very pleased that judge fogel has put content owners on notice ignore fair use at your peril
6709411 in order for a copyright owner to proceed under the dmca with a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorised by the copyright owner its agent or the law the owner must evaluate whether the material makes fair use of the copyright
6709412 the dmca already requires copyright owners to make an initial review of the potentially infringing material prior to sending a takedown notice
6709413 its in that future that machines from intel will surpass human intelligence
6709414 and progress in next hundred years will be more like the progress of last 20 000 years of human history because of technology
6709415 well need new materials to improve transistor performance and new technologies like tri gate transistors trigate gives you more power lower leakage and better density

6709420 the first question organisations need to answer is whether their turnover rates are outside the norm and need addressing
6709421 the typical organisation in todays environment can view a five per cent staff turnover as a normal cost of doing business
6709422 it managers often worry that investments in training will be reaped by other organisations when it workers shop their new skills around
6709423 but this study indicates that investing in training is actually the best way to retain employees
6709424 while offering competitive salaries and benefit packages may be important for recruitment providing quality of life incentives and enhancing working environments are more important for retention
6709425 rather than releasing a totally new and updated standard this is a revision of 1
6709426 in the future as we move to standard 2 0 there will more than likely be pretty major changes but in this version weve come up with a lot more clarity and consolidated a number of sub requirements
6709427 there is a lot of concern over how slow it is going
6709428 we really need the same level of functionality in network infrastructure to make it departments jobs more feasible and ultimately this has to come from the vendors
6709429 china for example is one of the biggest users of ipv6

6709431 we have underperformed certainly in budapest and maybe in the races before as well
6709432 we still want to catch the two in front of us
6709433 we were nowhere in hungary it was two or three issues the main one being tyres or the use of the tyres that can be put down to tyre pressures we just screwed up in terms of tyre pressures
6709434 hungary was quite disappointing we had big tyres pressure problems which had a big influence on the grip level and the balance of the car
6709435 this kind of problem shouldnt happen in f1 in general but unfortunately we did have some operational problems and it cost us a lot of points it also cost me 70 laps of the hungarian grand prix with a lot of effort to finish the race
6709436 we were miles off the operating window but we will try to improve and i hope this kind of thing wont happen again
6709437 these tyres are very sensitive to pressures it might be that robert communicates these developments whereas other drivers dont but everyone is dealing with the same problem
6709438 tyres are a key factor in lap time and the right tyre pressures change quite a lot depending on the ambient conditions track conditions and the way you change the car it is a difficult thing and we have learned we have to use a lot of time for getting that right
6709439 some of the teams behind us have made some good steps especially toyota and also renault and at times red bull
6709440 i have now reached the point at which i no longer care whether or not the answer is nuclear let it happen as long as its total emissions are taken into account

6709493 originally the event was set up part to dispel the myth that arose after the 1980s that gay men and women were not healthy after the emergence of hiv aids
6709494 it was also a great opportunity for gay men and women to diversify and take part in activities with like minded people but taking part for the love of their game not their sexual preference

6709601 opening with the perfect foreshadowing device a summary of the legend of st valentine author jamieson wolf sets the reader up for an erotic supernatural romp thats going to have meaning the story valentine is fast paced and well told and offers not just a quick and lusty romance but a storyline that makes the reader sympathize with the characters plights and care about the point wolf wishes to make
6709602 i like this writers way with words valentine is an amazing book that everyone shoul read he builds a good plot and develops his characters well i would give it 5 stars out of 5
6709603 jamieson wolf writes with some of the strongest emotion i have found in ages his passion is reminiscent of that seen in the works of shakespeare and others of that time period his characters love deeply and without restraint overcoming every obstacle placed before them this is truly a tale for all those who believe love has no boundaries
6709604 jamieson wolf is what i would call a fabulous storyteller he dreams up or gets visited by great characters and he paints them vividly when he writes he gets fantastic story ideas and pounds them out in a way that makes you lean in toward the computer screen or flip through the physical pages faster and faster to see whats happening to these people next
6709605 this book is great this is a must read book for any body who loves ghost fantasy supernatural fun a surprise around every corner awaits the reader i am so happy to have purchased this book and add it to my own family library we just have to wait until jamieson wolf gets another fun book out there for all of us to read well worth it for your own fun reading and for your book collection a five star rating from me love it

6709616 i think everybodys got a right to run for president who qualifies under the constitution and id be the last person to begrudge anybody their ambition
6709617 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
6709618 multi citizenship with responsibilities owed to and allegiance to other countries
6709619 apparently a normal restriction to avoid births during a flight
6709620 voters donated money goods and services to elect a nominee and were defrauded by sen obamas lies and obfuscations
6709621 if the dnc officers had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship as a child and failed to even perform the basic steps of regaining citizenship as prescribed by constitutional laws

6709643 a nossa resolu o confirma o acordo sobre o plano de seis pontos e n o h integridade territorial nesses princ pios
6709644 i dont think port adelaide would want to lose to the bottom team i wouldnt have thought
6709645 i think choco williams has always been a very competitive bloke as i am and hopefully the game will be a really good spectacle and we get some people to come along
6709646 greg addressed the players before training and was quite emotional in terms of his thoughts and contribution to the club
6709647 thats a little bit more incentive for the players but youd be disappointed if youve got to wheel out michael wilson one week to get a good effort and then youve got to wheel out the president who is leaving the next week to get a good effort
6709648 wed like to think our players are better than that and can find some self motivation thats what we work on and we certainly dont want to be rolling out gimmicks each week
6709649 weve investigated as to some of the reasons for why its happened weve worked on it recently in training well work on it again in pre season but we believe the main reason is the confidence and the self belief of individuals
6709650 over the last seven weeks weve conceded more points than nearly anyone in the comp so i think the defensive group needs to really improve but also collectively we need to really be doing a lot of pressure through our midfield so the ball is not getting delivered through
6709651 we are under no illusion that defensively some players have been struggling
6709652 that is going to be a huge area for us tomorrow night and if we are any chance of winning the game our defensive group really has to stand up
6709653 its been a problem all year lapses in concentration teams have been able to score very heavily in ten minute periods as were shown last week against geelong
6709654 i will look to play next year i still feel really good in my body
6709655 i think we are at a delicate stage we have played a lot of young guys and got a few more games into them
6709656 a lot of our senior guys in some respects more are key position players so it will be an interesting transition
6709657 that will be resolved at the end of the season but all were focused on is the next couple of weeks and the finals campaign and the rest will look after itself
6709658 collectively weve definitely got a point to prove regardless of whether you are out of contract or youre old or youre young
6709659 i think everyone is sort of on notice at the moment the way that we have been playing is unacceptable and not up to the standard we really require of each player
6709660 this is a terrible predicament for a family who loves their adoptive children
6709661 adoption services queensland asq will offer any assistance it can to indian federal and state agencies investigating the claims
6709662 we were not aware of the child kidnap allegations until last year asq conducted an audit of indian children who were adopted into queensland between 1995 and 2007
6709663 the adoption of the queensland child who was allegedly stolen was authorised by the madras high court in march 2000
6709664 i am aware of allegations regarding child trafficking and share concerns for the safety of children adopted from overseas
6709665 i have asked my department to make direct contact with the indian authorities and provide me with a brief on any potential legal issues arising in india and australia
6709666 the video shows that the plane caught fire only after it hit the ground
6709667 the fault fixed by spanairs maintenance technicians could not have had an influence on the crash
6709668 there was more than one cause an engine was not the cause of the accident
6709669 her mother handed her to us and the woman stayed behind there were too few firefighters at the beginning
6709670 the girl was totally disoriented she did not complain or talk despite the great number of serious injuries which she had
6709671 this fireman has become perhaps without intending to the hero of the day
6709672 kept asking me if it was true what was happening
6709673 he thought it was a film and he kept asking where was his father and when the film would end
6709674 the plane was rocking back and forth until i suspected it was going to fall
6709675 i saw people smoke explosions i think that is what woke me up because i had lost consciousness
6709676 i thought that if help did not arrive soon i would die
6709677 well if you admit to having drunk anything im afraid im required to breathalyse you
6709678 no but you had several passengers so we pulled you over
6709679 we have constant clear blue skies and just 80 100mm of rain a year
6709680 this means we can leave the fruit on the vine until the last possible moment this is why i came to get my hands on the best possible grapes in the best possible health to work with fruit of this quality is a winemakers dream
6709681 it was inevitable that cabernet sauvignon and merlot would be planted first because this is chile and this is what everyone thought the market demanded
6709682 but despite being semi arid this is a cool valley dry but cool and other varieties work better we had huge success with our first vintage in 1999 of chardonnay and syrah and i believe we are on the verge of something special
6709683 i tell them to accept that not all chile is great for growing cabernet
6709684 and why should we grow it given the stunning results were getting with other varieties i believe that carmen re will prove to be the jewel in limar s crown although i realise that others here dont but that might be because we were the first to plant it and bagged the best sites
6709685 theres just something about the soil the light and the climate
6709686 they give us exceptional fruit and i feel like a kid in a sweet shop not knowing which way to turn for me though its chardonnay which shines the grape has a superb silky ripeness coupled with an inimitable minerality to put limar on the map the valley needs an iconic wine and that wine needs to be chardonnay
6709687 theres nothing you can do with a perfectly ripe peach to improve it
6709688 if you make one really fabulous dish you dont have to do anything else provide great cheese bread and fruit and your friends will have feasted well
6709689 when it comes to founders we know we are usually going to see something odd
6709690 in some cases they are exorbitantly paid and in others they are paid miserly
6709691 coaching in the final yesterday it was so good for my heart that so many people are engaged in womens soccer
6709692 if you looked at the quality of the game and the excitement it had everything extra time that game was not only good for the usa but it was good for womens soccer overall
6709693 womens football is improving all the time and its getting tighter and tighter so now you have a handful of teams that can win the olympics and the world cup and thats really good for womens soccer overall
6709694 things are going to happen we are going to get beat every once in a while by these guys there are just way too good but we knew that we couldnt get down on ourselves and i think that confidence throughout all our games got us to where we are now
6709695 later on in the game especially when it went into overtime we could tell by their body language that they were really tired so that we knew that we had to take advantage of that
6709696 it says a lot about the team that we were able to come back after the opening norway loss here and after a huge devastating loss at the world cup last year and losing some players as well
6709697 its just so much fun playing for her weve found a new passion and really love for one another
6709698 its the best job ive ever had its just the best thing that ive ever done and as a coach this is unbelievable sort of a pipe dream

6709706 bei zahlreichen krankheiten ist die steigerung des verbrauchs zu begr en da sich die versorgung der patienten dadurch verbessert so hat sich die sterblichkeit an herz kreislaufkrankheiten in den vergangenen 40 jahren mehr als halbiert die versorgung mit arzneimitteln hat dazu wesentlich beigetragen
6709707 die arzneimittel die die forschenden pharma unternehmen in den letzten jahren zur zulassung brachten werden nun standard bei der behandlung von krankheiten f r die es noch vor wenigen jahren keine aussicht auf therapie gab mit nachweisbarem erfolg die forschenden pharma unternehmen nehmen ihre verantwortung ernst und investieren in die erforschung und entwicklung im letzten jahr allein in deutschland mehr als 4 5 milliarden euro nur die innovationsfeindliche kostend mpfungspolitik der bundesregierung mit ihren zum teil widerspr chlichen berregulierungen verhindert dass moderne medikamente noch h ufiger eingesetzt werden hier muss ein umdenken zum wohle der betroffenen einsetzen

6709766 todav a funcionan los estereotipos de que los gordos son personas vagas poco activas excluidas socialmente poco exitosas etc tera aunque ellos no se ven as
6709767 vemos como a partir de un solo dato el aspecto f sico tener obesidad las personas son capaces de atribuir caracter sticas de personalidad muy determinadas
6709768 provoca una estigmatizaci n de la obesidad que en nuestro caso conlleva una visi n de las personas obesas como fundamentalmente introvertidas e inhibidas
6709769 es necesario que se contemplen estos aspectos psicosociales y que no sea s lo prescribir un f rmaco una dieta y hacer ejercicio
6709770 en el tratamiento de la obesidad y para el conocimiento de todos los que abordan este tema psic logos m dicos etc es importante conocer los estereotipos y no partir de ideas preconcebidas
6709771 siendo cultura occidental no presenta los mismos elementos de presi n social hacia la delgadez que nosotros tenemos
6709772 que el obeso se perciba de tal o cual forma depende en buena medida de elementos sociales ya que en sitios donde se presenta una menor presi n social hacia la delgadez las personas obesas se sienten m s felices y por tanto la obesidad no tiene por qu comportar unas connotaciones negativas
6709773 la gente hace dieta porque quiere estar m s mono o m s mona no tanto porque est concienciada de que tiene un problema de salud especialmente en el sector joven
6709774 por encima de la salud una cuesti n est tica es capaz de contribuir al mantenimiento de un h bito claramente perjudicial

6709781 international statistics confirm that alitalia is one of the most secure airlines in the world
6709782 perhaps aviator az does not take into account the delicate situation in which we find ourselves
6709783 tipica degli analisti che considerano un ciclo o una bolla speculativa come cambiamento permanente non diversamente da quanto accadeva negli anni 70
6709784 questo studio di lynch vuole essere un contributo alla comprensione di quello che sta accadendo e accadr sui mercati petroliferi soprattutto esso aiuta a capirne la natura ciclica fatta di rapidi aumenti e riduzioni dei prezzi che riflettono la natura del business le grandi incertezze che esso deve scontare e il fatto che nonostante tutto il mercato fa il suo mestiere a dispetto delle previsioni dei politici la principale lezione che occorre lasciare leconomia libera di seguire i suoi percorsi che quasi mai appaiono ovvi ma che sono comunque unalternativa pi sicura ed efficiente allinterventismo pubblico
6709785 i see sci pioneering the research framework that would exploit positive synergies between sustainable consumption and production thereby breaking the present vicious cycle of unsustainable consumption and production soon a virtuous cycle would emerge where sustainable consumers would demand sustainable products and processes and in turn sustainable producers would encourage more sustainable consumption patterns and lifestyles role models and champions of both sustainable consumption and production would accelerate this trend
6709786 i am delighted to announce the appointment of professor munasinghe who will lead a world class team addressing the key issues of green consumption and climate change
6709787 he will be the driving force behind the scis aim of achieving a more sophisticated understanding of consumer attitudes and how consumers can be encouraged to buy green products and services

6709803 the data was held in a secure format on the contractors site it was downloaded on to a memory stick for processing purposes which has since been lost
6709804 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost the data loss reinforces the need for data protection to be taken seriously at all levels
6709805 this is a massive failure of duty it is not the first time that the government has been shown to be completely incapable of protecting the integrity of highly sensitive data
6709806 deeply disappointing that a loss of this kind had happened yet again
6709807 what is also worrying is that a separate organisation was involved in looking at this data
6709808 one would expect the home office to have this data but if you hand out memory sticks almost like confetti to companies that are meant to do research for you then you need to be absolutely certain that when you give such information away the company concerned have put into practice procedures that are just as robust as the procedures that i hope the government has followed since the loss of the child benefit discs
6709809 ive written to jacqui smith today to say i am deeply disappointed with whats happened in the view of what ministers have said to the select committee
6709810 one of the problems is that it is very hard to get rid of people who are not doing their jobs properly
6709811 once you get into the government civil service youre virtually unsackable no matter how incompetent you actually are
6709812 i think jacqui smith is going to have to do a lot of explaining to the home affairs select committee when we go back in october

6709815 they raise legitimately the question of why should you have another railroad in between them and the union pacific at eugene we agree operationally if someone else is going to take over the feeder line segment it makes perfect sense for them to connect directly with the up
6709816 the embargo of the corp rail line connecting the south coast of oregon with the union pacific mainline here in eugene has already had a significant impact on the economy of southwest oregon
6709817 i have no doubt the proposed abandonment of the line will have devastating consequences
6709818 its not a lack of investment in the asset that has caused the problems
6709819 kalau diperhitungkan setiap bulannya anggaran yang diambil oleh ketua dan sekretaris serta bendahara mencapai puluhan juta rupiah sedangkan segala operasional panwas seperti biaya bbm lembur sppd termasuk honor tetap dianggarkan jadi kemana dana tersebut

6709840 the carnival and festivals over the weekend will be ok any rain they see will come on saturday but otherwise they will see bright sunny spells
6709841 generally it will be dry and breezy with temperatures in the low 70s september is likely to bring settled conditions
6709842 the bulk of september will be a fine month in general with some late summer warmth with temperatures comfortably into the 70s to start and holding up nicely for most of the month
6709843 we can expect dry weather to start the month but there will also be some showery conditions towards the end of the month
6709844 the awful weather clearly has something to do with this hibernation hysteria
6709845 with gas and electric companies turning up the heat it looks like many people will be turning to their wardrobe rather than the central heating thermostat this winter to keep warm

6709858 martina was my everything she gave me a burst of new life and plans for the future her death has left me utterly broken
6709859 i was told on the night that there were only two ambulances covering the weston area that on a friday night in a busy resort is nowhere near enough i want to see more ambulances on call so this can never happen to anyone else i wont let this rest until something is done
6709860 a paramedic arrived on the scene within three minutes of the call
6709861 however the delay in back up to transport the patient to hospital is completely unacceptable
6709862 we will investigate so that lessons can be learnt from this

6709876 maybe you could call it a slog or a blite or maybe not
6709877 that means you will also have less drug reaching the normal tissue
6709878 the results are actually highly dependent on the surface chemistry
6709879 in other words you dont get this result just by attaching drugs to any nanotubes
6709880 right now what we are doing is so called passive targeting which is using the leaky vasculature of the tumor
6709881 but a more active targeting would be attaching a peptide or antibody to the nanotube drug one that will bind more specifically to the tumor which should further enhance the treatment efficacy
6709882 we are definitely hoping to be able to push this to practical applications into the clinic this is one step forward
6709883 but it will still take time to truly prove the efficacy and the safety

6709889 life is what happens when you are busy making other plans
6709890 i must commend the president of the guyana squash association for successfully hosting this tournament here in guyana the gsa is one of the best administered sports organizations in the country it is the most accountable transparent and all the parents and everyone are involved in developing the greatest asset in our land our young people
6709891 because we dont want to deplete our capability in the other regions to respond to any incident that may occur in those regions by concentrating only on the venues for activities
6709892 we will be on an elevated state of alertness throughout the country that is the security forces they will all be in line and we are going to have some additional features we are going to have regional support for surveillance so some surveillance aircraft will be over guyana to detect unusual activities
6709893 we are going to have a number of road blocks and again i am pleading with the public to understand that we have to provide a safe environment for everyone there will be some discomfort to many people who are driving they are going to have to go through a number of roadblocks all the vehicles will have to be searched
6709894 i plead with them for understanding sometimes when you want greater security you have to face the additional discomfort
6709895 the presence will be overwhelming and we dont want chaos and confusion in the venues you have to have tickets to attend these activities if you dont have tickets it doesnt make any sense that you come because you are not going to get it and i want to reiterate that message that the secretariat has been saying over and over
6709896 but i want to assure you that from all i have seen minister rohee and his team have worked in a dedicated fashion to put together solid security arrangements for the festival

6709902 any decent government should find no difficulty in creating the appropriate environment if indeed they are anxious to highlight guyana to the caribbean and the world
6709903 regrettably instead of addressing those concerns the jagdeo regime expended millions more than their original secret budgetary allocation of 500m on a massive publicity and pr public relations campaign to market the event

6709944 if demolition permits are filed the city would be obligated to consider the applications without regard to historical significance
6709945 but there are vacant buildings everywhere whats wrong with preserving the structures that are already on the hillside
6709946 like losing an icon the loss of the landmark would be incredibly significant
6709947 none of the human factor enters into this with the developers
6709948 there are a lot of people all around cincinnati that have roots that trace back here and the church itself peoples babies were baptized here people were married here
6709949 i believe hes trying to beat the clock before the historic district is finalized
6709950 were only three weeks out from the state hearing and hes already taken out a demolition permit
6709951 becoming uglier and more depressing with the impression that the developer will rapidly progress with demolition to foil the listing
6709952 the board was wonderful at getting back to the subject at hand
6709953 cranley appeared to know very little about the nomination or its process the chair and several members of the board stated that their role was to decide whether the district met the criteria for listing in the national register their role was not to decide whether a developer has plans to demolish or construct new buildings
6709954 she did a walking tour with us in march and we made her aware of the brown factor
6709955 both the city and state have recommended that we shorten the district were all geared up for whatever changes need to be made
6709956 i call this a kept secret because i hate to use the word best no one has seen the plans theyve gobbled up our whole neighborhood and they did it very secretly
6709957 the sedamsville civic association has voted to send a letter of approval to the city once they saw the development plans

6709959 certainly is not present expensive dear you look is simple is fine
6709960 what to me only to do make with all this goods
6709961 was seeking to correct an illegality was expanding ministerial discretion in the grant of fiscal concessions contrary to its undertaking to international financial institutions
6709962 was flagrantly breaching the tenets of transparency and accountability by the way it treated with the qaii investments and by the framework it was creating under the bill
6709963 how that could have been an answer to the illegality committed and the secrecy of the government in the qaii deal defies logic
6709964 so his action was within the law though it may be acknowledged that the directive was not in the best interests of transparency however there was no illegality
6709965 further the government simply cold shouldered the many calls to lay the agreement in the national assembly
6709966 what he failed to tell the national assembly and the nation was why the billions of dollars earned from the privatization have not been deposited in the consolidated fund of guyana as required by article 216 of our constitution no amount of ranting and raving could conceal such unconstitutionality
6709967 the auditor general stated that as at 30th april 2006 mistake none of the statements were received that draft appropriation accounts were received on 20th june 2007 and that the signed statements to facilitate the completion of these audits were not received until 24 june 2008 clearly the honourable minister of finance did not comply with the law in fact the signed statements to facilitate the 2006 audit were submitted some 15 months after the legal deadline
6709968 if the minister has not delivered the consolidated financial statements to the auditor general within four months following the end of the fiscal year the minister shall provide to the national assembly a statement as to the reasons why the consolidated financial statements have not been so delivered to the auditor general
6709969 this is truly indicative of the regard the government has for the rule of law
6709970 however because of the significance of the comments as contained in the relevant sections of my report relating to the following statements i am unable to form an opinion whether they properly present their respective state of affairs as at 31 december 2006
6709971 these are further examples of the governments interpretation of transparency and accountability
6709972 this is the typical knee jerk reaction from the government when something cannot be properly explained blame it on the pnc
6709973 let it be clearly understood that accounting officers and their staff are always given an opportunity to respond to the comments of the auditor general through exit conferences and by formal submission of comments to the public accounts committee pac of parliament
6709974 in open and unashamed violation of article 216 of the guyana constitution this money has not been paid into the consolidated fund all of this money has been deposited into special bank account no 3119 under the control of the minister of finance
6709975 these are further examples of the governments total disregard for the laws of the land the pncr calls upon the government to scrupulously observe and function within the laws of our country the work of the auditor general must not go in vain additionally the concept of observance of the rule of law is one that ought to apply with equal force and effect to the lowly citizen and to the mighty official to the state and all its institutions
6709976 the focus of the initiative was to seek to help respond to the trauma that arose out of the lusignan killings as well as to help repair some of the damage done to farming livelihoods during the clearing of the backlands in buxton and other areas
6709977 arising out of the workshops we were able to secure information that helped us determine who should benefit from the initiative
6709978 apart from the financial assistance which we received from the ministry we were also afforded technical advice that helped the pig farmers improve the conditions under which they work
6709979 in order to ensure the sustainability of this project the contract also stipulates that in the case of the pig formers three each of the first litter of pigs produced by each farmer must be given to another person to help them get started
6709980 a huge plus for this initiative is the fact that we have actually been able to get communities that were perhaps suspicious of each other to work together
6709981 the problem here is that the small business council has been asked to secure a consultancy to outline its programme of activities and this has not been produced as yet
6709982 my own impression is that the president is supportive of the small business community
6709983 there is an urgent need for a robust response to the needs of the small business community many owners of small and micro enterprises live from day to day and depend on their daily earnings to support their families
6709984 it is a lot of here it is necessary to tell but words have told comments are moderated and will not appear on this weblog until the author has approved them

6709986 collaboration towards the achievement of a single market and economy and political integration and regional air transportation
6709987 having taken note of the difficulties which have arisen in regard to progress towards the establishment of the caricom sic and the decision of the organisation of eastern caribbean states oecs to proceed to establish an economic union among themselves by 2009 the prime ministers of grenada st lucia st vincent and the grenadines and trinidad and tobago signed a joint declaration to establish a framework for closer cooperation towards the achievement of the single economy by 2011 and appropriate political integration by 2013
6709988 the prime ministers and foreign ministers also resolved that no initiative associated with the implementation of this joint declaration would undermine the single market or economic cohesion established by the revised treaty of chaguaramas
6709989 participation in this framework is open to all member states of the caribbean community wishing to commit to the achievement of the single economy and appropriate political integration within indicative timeframes
6709990 the decision of some caricom countries to establish a political union has implications for the structure and indeed the future of caricom the government of jamaica will request that the issue be brought for discussions at the highest level of caricom jamaicas position will be evaluated based on those discussions

6709998 since their low point in the mid 1990s chinas soes have made a stunning return to profitability
6709999 the government has been willing to subordinate other agendas such as privatisation to the quest for a robust state enterprise sector that was financially self sufficient and able to contribute to the government revenue base as well
