5090005 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5090006 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5090007 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5090008 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5090009 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5090010 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5090011 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5090012 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5090013 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5090014 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5090015 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5090016 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5090017 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5090018 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5090019 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5090020 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5090021 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5090022 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5090023 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5090024 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5090025 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

5090032 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5090033 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5090034 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5090035 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5090036 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5090037 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5090038 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5090039 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5090040 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5090041 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5090042 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5090043 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

5090046 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5090047 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5090048 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

5090057 these couples are mainly from poor communities and could not afford the big costs of a normal wedding
5090058 people and news media tend to focus on what is considered to be controversial rather than focus on the issues that are relevant to a lot of the countries in the region
5090059 a singular focus is not good for anybody and certainly not good for the people that we are trying to be responsible for
5090060 i know some people turn their nose down a bit at the prospect that people could save 10 or so on a tank of petrol but we dont he told abc tv
5090061 we think its a very important part of having a more competitive petrol market and we intend to fight for it in the senate
5090062 well we do so we are going to get up there and fight for this measure
5090063 its an important measure and we think its important because it can help people save a small amount of money admittedly from time to time
5090064 but thats important to a lot of people who are under financial pressure
5090065 jumped the gun in supporting moves to introduce fuelwatch to south australia four years ago
5090066 but then i set up a parliamentary inquiry he told channel 9
5090067 i was part of that inquiry process and it became quite clear that if you want to tackle the whole issue of fuel prices effectively the best way to do that is to tackle the issue of competition amongst the big four oil companies
5090068 what horse trading implies is that youll support something you dont believe in in order to get something else through
5090069 the problem with horse trading is sometimes youll end up with a donkey or even worse a trojan horse so i need to decide things on their merit and issues have to be taken on their merits
5090070 i cant in good conscience support a law that i just dont agree with
5090071 were feeling really happy and were really at peace now because youre always a little bit nervous before it all takes place
5090072 were really proud of the boys for having worked so hard and having achieved their goal
5090073 when we saw that they started out in that first 500 metres they had a good start i think one of their best speeds we were feeling i think pretty confident that they would be able to do it
5090074 our speaker got up and just praised brian we were all excited about it
5090075 she was almost running on the spot she was so excited
5090076 weve been very much praying for him and his team
5090077 she was yelling and they were all screaming in the background and they were having a great time and totally celebrating and taking it all in
5090078 they were a much much stronger boat this year theyre such a solid group and theyre determined thats all it takes
5090079 we know its a lot of stress and anything can happen for him to hang on and have a little bit of kick left in there is just incredible it was just an amazing outcome we couldnt be happier for him

5090081 it has come to our attention that representatives of hamed ehadadi an iranian basketball player may be contacting nba teams to discuss the possibility of signing mr ehadadi to an nba player contract
5090082 we have been advised that a federal statue prohibits a person or organization in the
5090083 i am sure he will play there this season because he has played great at the olympics he is a talented player he is ok for beginning in the nba after practicing a few years you will see that he will be one of the great players
5090084 the iranian basketball federation supports him to play in the best situation for his basketball career
5090085 we would like for him to go to a place where he will play not sit on the bench thats very important for our basketball and also for him

5090089 but in my view your face is not everything real beauty lies inside a person not outside
5090090 because beauty is all about faces and beautiful girls and skin
5090091 help us bring back a smile to the face of these survivors
5090092 they say that when we come to a beauty salon we come with the expectation that were going to be relaxed in a different frame of mind
5090093 if we come here and we see someone who has gone through so much pain and misery so automatically that gives us that low feeling also they have a point
5090094 at the same time there are clients who take pride in asking these girls to give them a blow dry or getting a manicure or pedicure taken from them
5090095 once we had a wedding in the family i went there and all the girls were getting dressed and putting on makeup so that time i felt a pain in my heart
5090096 but i dont want to weaken myself with these thoughts
5090097 the peace of mind i have now i never had before i suffered much more mental anguish in my married life
5090098 i feel that her hands call me again and again

5090192 n s fomos muito felizes hoje porque fizemos o jogo sobrando em campo com todo respeito ao n utico mas depois de tudo aquilo se criou durante a semana o pr prio roberto fernandes dizendo que era o carrasco do goi s e aquela coisa toda e eu acabei n o comentando nada mas hoje foi minha nona vit ria seguida contra o n utico sete pelo sport e uma pelo fortaleza
5090193 futebol n o d pra remoer o passado ficar buscando dados futebol jogado e hoje n s sobramos
5090194 n s temos que ter o pensamento l em cima no primeiro turno foram tr s pontos em quatro jogos e agora j temos tr s no primeiro jogo vamos esquecer esses 23 pontos e fazer o nosso segundo turno para depois reunir tudo e buscar alguma coisa maior do que lutar contra o rebaixamento
5090195 a gente trabalha para a equipe criar o maior n mero de chances e ficar mais pr ximo da vit ria mas o resultado disso s vem com um maior n mero de jogos o time melhorou mostrou uma agressividade que antes n s n o v amos e dominou o flamengo
5090196 isso o que nos deixa confiantes para sair dessa o time jogou bem e criou chances enquanto isso acontece voc tem esperan as pior seria se tivesse achado o empate por acaso
5090197 o time levou gols que n o saem a toda hora no primeiro a bola bateu em dois jogadores nossos e entrou no ngulo no segundo a bola estava com a gente perdemos e saiu o p nalti que no meu modo de ver n o foi muito claro
5090198 a exig ncia com a gente parece que muito maior em dois jogos a cobran a toda em cima de mim n o por a todos t m sua parcela de culpa mas a nossa bem menor avisou a equipe evoluiu e isso que precisa ser visto pois com pouco tempo n o d para fazer milagres
5090199 todos tiveram oportunidade de ver uma equipe dedicada que se entregou do primeiro ao ltimo minuto de jogo as oportunidades criadas comprovam isso e pelo que fizemos poder amos ter feito tr s ou quatro gols o flamengo criou duas oportunidades e marcou os gols

5090214 very much in control of the huddle like he always is and very much in control of the game and that allowed us to be in control as an offense as a unit we felt like everything that we were going to run was going to work
5090215 he moved the team down the field and put us in a position to score
5090216 does that sound a little awkward or funny maybe a little bit believe me i feel very comfortable here the guys have been great theyve welcomed me i feel like im here for a reason as ive told the guys im here for one reason to help you win ill do whatever that takes and i hope it works out
5090217 obviously a lot of things have gone on the last few months
5090218 im not going to sit here and say i havent second guessed decisions not only this year but along the way one thing i know for sure when i stepped on the field as i did tonight i knew i made the right decision
5090219 were a team and im just one piece of this puzzle
5090220 at some point we have to go on and focus on what were trying to do as a team and not on one person
5090221 safe children in a digital world the report of the byron review
5090222 hey guys look at that interweb thing its loaded with bad things
5090223 to stifle his pain he gave himself to a life of profligacy frequented the public dancing rooms and took to drinking
5090224 it was this that seems to have dictated his final action
5090225 obviously at least to proal in what would later be known as a jack thompson moment the boy was not to blame victor hugo was responsible for driving an otherwise innocent boy to crime and for this victor hugo should be punished
5090226 primitive physical movement difficult to describe in terms suitable to a family newspaper
5090227 gave an exhibition that was suggestive and vulgar tinged with the kind of animalism that should be confined to dives and bordellos
5090228 comic magazines a poisonous mushroom growth of the last two years
5090229 it does and thats largely because the teenage brain is different from the adult brain the impulse control center of the brain the part of the brain that enables us to think ahead consider consequences manage urges thats the part of the brain right behind our forehead called the prefrontal cortex
5090230 thats under construction during the teenage years in fact the wiring of that is not completed until the early 20s
5090231 and so when a young man with a developing brain already angry spends hours and hours and hours rehearsing violent acts and then hes put in this situation of emotional stress theres a likelihood that he will literally go to that familiar pattern thats been wired repeatedly perhaps thousands and thousands of times
5090232 a great deal of benefit in comic books and virtually no harm the comic is the folklore of the times spontaneously given to an received by children serving at the same time as a means of helping them to solve the individual and sociological problems appropriate to their own lives comic books may be said to offer the same type of mental catharsis to their readers that aristotle claimed was an attribute of the drama well balanced children are not upset by even the more horrible scenes in the comics as long as the reason for the threat of torture is clear and the issues are well stated
5090233 we must stop these things from getting into our kids hands
5090234 it is community standards but bestiality and kiddie porn are obscene per se
5090235 we should act for the nations mothers they are helpless to protect their children from the lurid booklets through which cavort half nude women belittle law enforcement and glorify crime
5090236 there has been significant industry progress and reforms over the last decade but ever more violent and sadistic games are still ending up in the hands of children retailers would rather appear as if they care about children instead of actually small steps to protect them
5090237 i have developed legislation that will empower parents by making sure their kids cant walk into a store and buy a video game that has graphic violent and pornographic content todays report is yet further proof that we need to make sure parents have the tools and support they need to make informed decisions for their children
5090238 we have the obligation to be constantly vigilant about amending our laws to protect the residents of new york state many of these bills will do just that by closing loopholes or creating new laws to enhance the quality of life for all new yorkers the first duty of government is to provide a safe society for our resident to live work and raise their families these new laws will enhance the protections afforded to the citizens of this state and will address gaps in protection that have existed for years i applaud the legislature for working with me and my staff to reach agreements on fixing these problems
5090239 put whatever you want in a game we will tell you who can buy it

5090241 were destitute financially well change that but financially we have nothing as a specific result of this
5090242 true residual income can only come from duplicating large groups of loyal retail customers not from constantly recruiting ibos having a 50 annual fallout rate
5090243 one must turn outside the world of business to religion and politics to find people who work as hard for as little financial reward as most amway people do
5090244 pro suming is the concept that says the cheapest buy is not necessarily the best and that a person will never be rich by consumption
5090245 recruits are brainwashed into spending a fortune on peripherals while consuming amway products they either lose their shirts or begin making money by getting enough people underneath to do the same

5090254 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5090255 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5090256 no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempt to legalize ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to its knees and undermine our democratic system
5090257 georgia is a sovereign state and the territorial integrity of the state must be provided for
5090258 i wish peace for my country and for our children we do not want to live in fear
5090259 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5090260 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5090261 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5090262 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5090263 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5090264 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5090265 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5090266 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5090267 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5090268 los pueblos tienen los gobiernos que merecen tener aunque luego se arrepientan
5090269 el mayor problema de espa a con la crisis es un gobierno que niega su existencia
5090270 rajoy cuenta con heredar el poder de zapatero no con gan rselo
5090271 la pr ctica de los consejeros viola la ley ind gena 19 253 y los principios ticos al asumir posiciones vitalicias y patrimoniales sobre la conadi
5090272 nosotros queremos que el gobierno le d una soluci n a los problemas de tierra que tenemos en diferentes comunidades tambi n rechazamos la actuaci n de estos consejeros que est n imponiendo su derecho afirmando que el trabajo que ellos hacen es verdadero nosotros decimos que el gobierno est buscando un medio para buscar soluciones en estas comunidades
5090273 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
5090274 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
5090275 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos
5090276 el 11 de julio inform por oficio al ministro del interior de la gravedad de los hechos que est n ocurriendo en nuestra comuna y hasta la fecha no he recibido respuesta alguna percibo que est violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales por eso pido el m ximo de preocupaci n para resolver este problema
5090277 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e

5090279 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
5090280 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
5090281 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces

5090286 when i connected with dottie the ball started to roll
5090287 if it wasnt for her i dont know where it would have gone
5090288 i pitched and won both games of a doubleheader once pitching underhand
5090289 i think i could have pitched a doubleheader overhand too
5090290 i dont think it would be that hard nowadays the men cant do it but hell they cant do nothin
5090291 she did a lot of letter writing to support people who had problems she was a good shoulder
5090292 the movie is second place so far as we are concerned
5090293 being accepted by cooperstown was the greatest thing that happened to any of us
5090294 characterized by unexpected shapes that twist bend fall and lean in continuous organic movement
5090295 almost a portrait of the black males ability to survive
5090296 youre up then knocked down then you have to get up again
5090297 i began to feel europe was taking a lot from me and not giving me what i went there to find the vitality of the civil rights movement brought me back
5090298 he played a major role in bringing black music to the masses and in the evolution of rhythm and blues to soul music
5090299 beyond that he really developed the role of the record producer jerry did a lot more than just turn on a tape recorder he left his stamp on a lot of great music he had a commercial ear as well as a critical ear
5090300 he was incredibly abrasive and incredibly generous very abrupt and very very patient seemingly a pure sharklike businessman and also a cerebral and creative genius
5090301 its funky its deep its very emotional but its clean
5090302 how could he understand what was inside of black people like that
5090303 we used to close the book on a friday and come back to work on a tuesday
5090304 one friday the editor got us together and said listen lets change this from race records a lot of people were beginning to find it inappropriate come back with some ideas on tuesday
5090305 one guy said this and one guy said that and i said rhythm and blues and they said oh that sounds pretty good lets do that in the next issue that section came out as rhythm and blues instead of race
5090306 when i said i wanted to sing like that jerry said the best way was to get a pianist and learn how those songs are done
5090307 one thing jerry wexler taught me was that if youve got a sexy or torchy song you mustnt attitudinize on top of it because it sounds redundant
5090308 butch you know if it were my money theres nobody id rather have steal it than you
5090309 but you see i am still in the employment of e h harriman of the union pacific railroad
5090310 nobody had a larger group of completely devoted friends than george
5090311 his intelligence was of inestimable value to me in the work ive done
5090312 the tendency toward cult and coterie by which literary magazines usually define their particular territory and assert their standards
5090313 as the most influential editor of his time he shaped not only the tastes but the direction of american writing
5090314 his sons saw the former and his writers the latter
5090315 unfortunately these extended to the golf course he could never believe that he hit the ball as badly as he did
5090316 words cannot describe the depth of sadness in our hearts
5090317 no one could have imagined that mahmouds voice could disappear
5090318 he used high language to talk about daily life in a truly exceptional way
5090319 this is someone who remained at the top of arabic poetry for 40 years it was not simply about politics
5090320 write down i am an arab and my identity card number is 50 000 i have eight children and the ninth will come after a summer
5090321 therefore write down on the top of the first page i do not hate people nor do i encroach but if i become hungry the usurpers flesh will be my food beware beware of my hunger and my anger
5090322 sometimes i feel as if i am read before i write when i write a poem about my mother palestinians think my mother is a symbol for palestine but i write as a poet and my mother is my mother
5090323 working in a bookstore was like a candy shop for her
5090324 at least three times a year id get a book with a note saying she thought id find it interesting she did that with everybody
5090325 shed get them set up with doctors shed work with other charitable groups to obtain food lodging and counseling
5090326 he was not under the gun to leave but he felt it was not a good place to be he wanted his children to have an opportunity to live in a free state and be able to live in a democracy when he left most of his family and friends thought he was crazy
5090327 he was a very fine physician and an outstanding anesthesiologist
5090328 he was always there to lift your spirits he was a wonderful father and the embodiment of the american dream
5090329 when i was 12 he took me on rounds with him and that got the ball rolling
5090330 on a national scale we are 10 per cent of the problem with greenhouse gas emissions but we can be 20 per cent of the solution
5090331 this government of course in spinning it this way is demonstrating that its out of touch with reality
5090332 the reality is that violent crime has again increased in this state and violent crime is the thing that most people are concerned about

5090343 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche

5090375 we train with guys and thats hard i think if i can beat a guy at my weight i can beat any woman at my weight
5090376 alicia has what good quality wrestlers have and thats heart
5090377 she actually believes that she can do something with wrestling and thats why im dedicated to her
5090378 the key for me is just a lot of experience as many matches as possible as many international tournaments as possible
5090379 when i was in high school soccer was my main focus
5090380 i always wanted to be at a really extreme level of competition
5090381 once i started wrestling i saw what my potential was i saw that maybe this was my green light maybe it wasnt soccer
5090382 i always thought of alicia as the 80 percenter but with a tenacity and a physicality that made up for maybe not having the best move on the soccer ball or whatever it was shed take you down she has a physicality thats intense
5090383 she would work harder in practice than some of the other guys on the team
5090384 if youre going to be a successful wrestler you need to be able to take the whole experience in and she was able to take everything as a learning experience
5090385 but i proved myself and i think the boys respected that
5090386 im still very young its intimidating but its also inspiring
5090387 the first time we went to see her first championship i was surprised that the movements were even graceful
5090388 of course there are rules and styles and alicias determined vicious look but also flow timing speed it was exciting
5090389 shes the perfect partner we spend a lot of time together and were there to support one another
5090390 she goes hard all the time she wants to go to the olympics so she puts a lot of time into wrestling pretty much all the time she can really
5090391 its the best of two worlds its strange but the two things that i love doing more than anything in my life are wrestling and esthetics its a good balance
5090392 but its all about finding your bliss and she seems to have discovered it
5090393 a lot of people think of huge jacked women who are involved with mens wrestling thats totally unrealistic
5090394 its really upsetting because theres so much great talent but its hard for girls to find training spaces and coaching
5090395 i cant say that when i was little i dreamt of the olympics because i didnt
5090396 but now i can see its an attainable goal because there is that market for womens wrestling its also more confidence boosting when you know that theres an opportunity to be at the olympic level
5090397 and the key thing is we take it step by step so far so good

5090413 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5090414 this is unbelievable were winning races were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5090415 ten points is 10 points the beauty of it is keeping kyle from getting 10 points hes so fast you cant give him any room
5090416 what were doing here is a little bit of practicing for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car carl edwards did a great job the pit crew did a great job
5090417 it just came down to when he beat us off of pit road
5090418 that was it for us we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys we were good on that one run that one set of tires but that was pretty much what we had
5090419 we just didnt have enough for the no 99 there at the end we werent able to get through the corners as fast as carl was
5090420 carls right there he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5090421 we were a nine out of a 10 it seems like and those other guys were a 10 out of a 10
5090422 just to gamble a little bit on staying on track we knew at worst that we would still finish in the top five it was something to take a shot we certainly learned from it if we had to do it all over again wed probably still do it again

5090427 this exercise was exactly what they executed in georgia just a few weeks later
5090428 i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying i have said repeatedly that i would have been completely in fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported which was to say that you should provide assistance to any infant that was born even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion that was not the bill that was presented at the state level what that bill also was doing was trying to undermine roe vs wade by the way we also had a bill a law already in place in illinois that insured life saving treatment was given to infants so for people to suggest that i and the illinois medical society so illinois doctors were somehow in favor of withholding life saving support from an infant born alive is ridiculous it defies commonsense and it defies imagination and for people to keep on pushing this is offensive and its an example of the kind of politics that we have to get beyond its one thing for people to disagree with me about the issue of choice its another thing for people to out and out misrepresent my positions repeatedly even after they know that theyre wrong and thats whats been happening
5090429 you really need to know why youre adopting these technologies
5090430 you cant just leap in every time a new things gets hyped
5090431 one day it will be as simple to use as electricity and you just plug it in
5090432 a lot of the hype will be around the promise that has been held out for a very simple to use flexible approach to information technology and the reality of achieving that is going to be out of line
5090433 whenever you try to achieve one of these big dreams its inevitably harder to get there than you think and it takes longer to get there than people tend to think
5090434 i think the quality of the experience that these systems have brought is very attractive and it does start to introduce an element of feeling that you are at least partially there
5090435 that has been missing in previous generations of the technology
5090436 they will go to the actual facebook or myspace route and say yep we want to bring it in and well figure out what the problems are once we do that
5090437 you have this peripheral vision of whats happening around you that a lot of the more point to point collaboration tools dont give you
5090438 they are willing to put up with the unknowns that you get when you get popular consumer technologies into the enterprise
5090439 a lot of dancers use wax in their shows choose plain soft paraffin unscented non colored candles because they melt at the lowest temperatures the harder the wax the hotter the temperature and that will sting test it before you pour it let the candle burn until a pool of wax has formed blow out the flame wait a bit then pour it in drops you want to make sure the candle is high so the wax drops cool as they fall
5090440 hey pers didnt your mom put your picture up on the walmart wall of heroes
5090441 yep my grandma did when i went to afghanistan im on the nevada missouri walmart wall of heros ive even got my dress blues on
5090442 if my mother ever distributed my likeness without written authorization i would disown her
5090443 technically speaking bradford didnt your biological parents disown you when they put you up for adoption
5090444 point ray i was one of those unfortunates adopted by upper middle class professionals nurtured in an environment of learning art and a socio religous culture steeped in more than 2 000 years of talmudic tradition
5090445 not everyone is lucky enough to have been raised in a whiskey tango white trash trailer park by a bow legged female whose sole qualification for motherhood is a womb that happened to catch the sperm of a passing truck driver
5090446 as i had worked at the patna college for three years but showed an experience of two years as a lecturer the company raised an objection terming it as a deceit on my part
5090447 when i went back to my company after being released from the sits custody i was told to take one weeks rest
5090448 i think there isnt enough understanding of the fact that in a democracy how you treat the security of the minority must be very important for the success of a democracy you cant only make token gestures and actually let them be in the state that they are as the rajinder sachar committee report shows so what happens is token gestures are made but real issues are never addressed
5090449 i wanted to buy a flat in bombay and it wasnt given to me because i was a muslim and i read the same about saif ali khan now i mean if javed akhtar and shabana azmi cant get a flat in bombay because they are muslims then what are we talking about
5090450 thats why i am so distressed over what is happening in kashmir for heavens sake it should be brought to a stop and it should have been brought to a stop right when they started that nonsense

5090465 mike had nowhere to go very tricky conditions as rain began to fall the entire field was on race slicks and just about to come in for rain tires
5090466 its obviously disappointing that we dropped out of the race so early mike and the team did everything right throughout the weekend i just feel really bad for everyone i think we had a car that could have taken us to a top three finish
5090467 there were a lot of positives that came out of the weekend though the team gained a great deal of confidence performing well in all of the practice sessions and qualifying ive been training a lot since my last outing at virginia and i felt a great improvement in my physical performance all in all the weekend was successful the team improved on their performance and we showed how competitive we can be on a new course im really looking forward to my next race with pr1 motorsports again i want to thank my personal sponsors kolliner long gallery based in cambria california and alpinestars for their tremendous support

5090470 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5090471 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5090472 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5090473 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5090474 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5090475 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5090476 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

5090523 i concede with sorrow that the baseless fanaticism of our people is in part to be blamed for the awakening of arab distrust i can raise no sympathy at all for the misdirected piety which transforms a piece of a herodian wall into a national relic thereby offending the feelings of the natives

5090532 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5090533 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5090534 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5090535 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5090536 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5090537 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5090538 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5090539 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5090540 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5090541 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5090542 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5090543 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5090544 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5090545 this is such a tough golf course that sometimes when you hit a good shot it doesnt end up in a good spot

5090547 it was about as hard as i thought it would be
5090548 i figured if i shot around par on those last holes id be close especially with the wind swirling around in the trees
5090549 it was about 30 feet with at least five feet of break its nice to be able to be a little more aggressive knowing youre chipping and putting well

5090592 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
5090593 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
5090594 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
5090595 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
5090596 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
5090597 i was going to quit but instead of quitting i decided to go over there to the cpca for a year
5090598 i wanted to go to new venues meet new people and show the people my face instead of on tv its been great so far

5090604 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat
5090605 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving
5090606 its a team thing its tough to get into this sport without a family
5090607 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
5090608 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
5090609 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
5090610 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
5090611 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
5090612 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
5090613 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
5090614 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
5090615 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
5090616 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
5090617 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
5090618 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
5090619 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
5090620 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
5090621 he wanted to help get children away from a life of crime and violence
5090622 thats why hes the king of comedy he never lost his soul in chicago

5090624 he always had time to shake a hand he was always that kid from chicago who wanted to make everybody happy and everybody laugh

5090640 people have actually missed the point that advertising because its actively trying to play us is actually probably the smartest industry of them all
5090641 no one has ever really wrestled advertising to the ground and it is the sort of thing that sort of permeates every minute of our waking lives
5090642 we knew dentons approach would be irreverent and also steeped in the desire to want to know more it wasnt going to be a flip show it was going to be rigorous
5090643 that split second when the malls intentionally confusing layout makes our eyes glaze and our jaws slacken the moment when we forget what we came for and become impulse buyers
5090644 i found myself in the supermarket and i went to buy the cheaper dishwashing liquid and found my hand moving over to the more expensive because the advertising told me thats the one to get as i wrote in the pitch document if you can be persuaded to buy the orange dishwashing liquid when the green one is cheaper what else can you be persuaded to do how do you even know your thoughts are your own
5090645 are surrounded by advertising but dont think about it that much and this show helps people think in a way thats funny and interesting
5090646 it would suit an edgy public broadcaster or a risk taking private broadcaster

5090837 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5090838 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5090839 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5090840 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5090841 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5090842 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5090843 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5090844 how long do you think youll have to wait now
5090845 dont let it worry you just yet it could be a while
5090846 but i am worried i mean what if something happens to you
5090847 whats going to happen to me the worst that can happen is that they throw me straight back in here
5090848 well dont worry about me okay you need to be more worried about yourself once youre in here alone
5090849 youre listening to me right you know better than i do how dangerous some of the girls in here are theyll eat you alive given half the chance some of them literally
5090850 go wash your face and use the toilet if you need to
5090851 hey dont look at me like that fujimoto ive given you guys an extra three minutes out here with your buddies
5090852 oh dear have a bit of an accident did we
5090853 family had wanted a baby but when they learned that theirs would be born with down syndrome they wanted an abortion for that they went to christ hospital in the southwestern suburbs of chicago which is affiliated with the united church of christ
5090854 in induced labor or prostaglandin abortion a common procedure at the hospital the doctor administers drugs that dilate the mothers cervix and induce contractions forcing a small baby out of the mothers uterus most of the time the baby dies in utero killed by the force of the violent contractions but it does not always work such abortions sometimes result in a premature baby being born alive sometimes the survivors live for just a few minutes but sometimes for several hours no one tried to save or treat them it is hard to save someone you just mauled trying to kill but something had to be done with them for the minutes and hours during which they struggled for air
5090855 to take this baby and leave him in a soiled utility closet stanek offered to take him instead i couldnt let him die alone she says
5090856 was doing nothing illegal under the laws of illinois doctors had no ethical or legal obligation to treat these premature babies
5090857 on march 30 2001 obama was the only senator to speak in opposition to a bill that would have banned the practice of leaving premature abortion survivors to die
5090858 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
5090859 that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among those are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
5090860 when have you ever voted for legislation to reduce the number of abortions
5090861 the fact is that although weve had a president who is opposed to abortion over the last eight years abortions have not gone down
5090862 falar sobre isso chato quem daqui como eu que sou santista desde pequeno sofre com isso mas preciso ver que a equipe evoluiu nesta partida dif cil mas temos que ter calma sen o n o vamos chegar lugar nenhum
5090863 mas n o s isso um conjunto de aspectos logo que assumi tivemos um bom momento depois ca mos e ainda n o encontramos o ponto de equil brio
5090864 a equipe sentiu o segundo gol e a possibilidade de rea o fica reduzida a se precipita as jogadas estivemos muito abaixo do normal
5090865 foi um resultado bom quando o time joga bem tudo volta ao normal e n s fomos bem hoje s que poder amos ter feito mais gols em rela o ao saldo de gols mas a equipe est de parab ns pela grande evolu o
5090866 n o deixamos o contra ataque acontecer tivemos boas chances o grande pecado foi o n mero alto de passes errados mais isso foi porque n s tentamos esse detalhe deixou a desejar mas com o volume de jogo que apresentamos no segundo tempo poder amos ter feito mais tr s gols
5090867 n o tem jogo f cil n s que fizemos o jogo ficar f cil s fazer o que o treinador est pedindo fizemos isso contra a portuguesa e contra o flamengo e nossa equipe se torna mais qualificada quando jogamos indo para cima com marca o dura conseguimos desempenhar bem esse papel hoje
5090868 foi um resultado totalmente justo se o goi s tivesse feito mais gols ainda sairia de bom tamanho fez tr s vezes e n o foi nem incomodado mas poderia ter feito mais
5090869 o resultado normal para uma partida fora de casa o que n o foi normal foi a postura da equipe ap tica que n o soube atacar alguns jogadores atuaram muito abaixo do que poderia jogar
5090870 a disputa pelo t tulo n o est descartada claro que ficou mais dif cil porque chegamos aqui com oito pontos de diferen a e agora s o 11 mas ningu m jogou a toalha aqui pois tem muito caminho pela frente e temos de somar o m ximo de pontos poss veis se n o der o t tulo temos de conseguir pelo menos a libertadores
5090871 o time correu para caramba mas o campo molhado dificultou quando o campo secou nosso time melhorou
5090872 quando vi o rapaz sozinho eu tentei abafar o chute de onde eu estava era dif cil de ver a posi o irregular mas n o preciso reclamar para que seja marcado impedimento
5090873 o flamengo com um jogador a menos soube jogar jogar muito bem e est de parab ns mas a gente sabe que est devendo muito ainda comentou o camisa 1 do flamengo em grande parte respons vel pelo ponto conquistado pelos cariocas neste final de semana
5090874 simplest because i know exactly how to do it but stupidly complex
5090875 simplest because i know exactly how to do it but gt stupidly complex
5090876 o returno come ou agora e o s o paulo tem um time forte grande e qualificado nosso time fez o dever de casa e sab amos que o jogo seria dif cil choveu bastante hoje domingo e isso atrapalhou mas nosso time est de parab ns pela for a
5090877 deixa eu ver a foto que voc tirou ainda n o consegui me ver com esse chap u acho que deve estar engra ado porque o pessoal do futebol n o parava de dar risada quando eu passei por eles
5090878 foi muito importante para mim ter essa conviv ncia com os demais atletas saber do esfor o de cada um das dificuldades que eles passam para continuar no esporte tenho conversado bastante com o ricardo e emanuel o pessoal da nata o que conheci em macau durante a aclimata o e com a galera do tiro com arco que est o pr ximos de mim
5090879 serviu como um aprendizado apesar de estar em um n vel bom e competitivo para lutar por uma medalha acabei sentindo a falta de experi ncia e sofri com a press o por isso acabei perdendo
5090880 ontem depois da prova do c sar fui conhecer a muralha da china achei muito legal
5090881 voc acredita que a primeira vez que venho zona internacional da vila desde que eu cheguei est sendo bom dar uma volta por aqui j tinha feito algumas comprinhas amanh partir de volta ao brasil
5090882 tenho que me preparar forte para o pr ximo ciclo ol mpico
5090883 encontrei ele ontem pedi para tirar uma foto com a medalha e ele deixou inclusive eu tocar nela foi muito bom esse momento que serviu como uma inspira o para mim que ainda vou competir e representar o brasil da melhor forma poss vel
5090884 s falamos com ele antes da prova mas assistimos tudo por aqui e torcemos muito uma pena que a gente ainda n o o tenha visto com a medalha
5090885 i shall reside among them and walk among them and i shall be their god and they will be my people
5090886 therefore get out from among them and separate yourselves says jehovah and quit touching the unclean thing
5090887 and i shall be a father to you and you will be sons and daughters to me this quotation has nothing to do with not celebrating religious holidays
5090888 youve got to be trusted by the people you lie to so when they turn their backs on you get get the chance to put the knife in
5090889 clearly 4kings havent wasted enough money on cs 1 6 over the past five or six years
5090890 we were far from playing how we should both because of our own attitude and their good performance
5090891 its sad to see toomi and natu leave as theyve worked hard for the team since they joined
5090892 seine erfahrungsschatz ist einzigartig man sollte ihn in geeigneter weise nutzen
5090893 esas sepulturas hieren la memoria porque los muertos perdieron en vida toda dignidad esas tumbas lastiman porque la muerte los alcanz sin que se percatasen de ella no hubo c mo decir adi s ni hasta luego las palabras detenidas siempre lastiman las palabras no dichas son peque os alfileres que circulan en la sangre una dos y millones de veces circulan hasta que se detiene el coraz n
5090894 me duele aceptar que llevo a cuestas muchas palabras sin decir no laceran demasiado pero de cuando en cuando regresan e incomodan su nico destino es el papel escribo porque a n cuando el papel no cura aminora el dolor las palabras no evitan el insomnio pero permiten que llegue la ma ana las palabras escritas aten an el dolor de los muertos que se marchan sin despedirse y muchos de ellos no dejan de morir porque el silencio hiere persigue escribir aunque sea para uno mismo es una forma de atemperar el silencio y de impedir que el olvido sepulte
5090895 en esa poca la escritura era un resguardo personal y una opci n para encontrar donde vaciar mis penas e impedir que las llagas de la vida rebasasen mi capacidad de gozar de estar de ser escrib a para evitar que los fantasmas los espectros las ausencias y las querencias que me rodeaban me disminuyesen poco importaba si mis notas se publicar an o no la escritura se hab a convertido en una forma de aminorar el dolor y en un espacio donde escucharme es cierta la vieja idea que sostiene que ante todo uno escribe para s mismo
5090896 permitir que las palabras sangren era permitir que los yoes internos se expresasen las palabras eran buen sost n imposible hundirse si hab a letras y papel

5090904 hes got a lot longer track record than the 2004 campaign against sen
5090905 hes a legendary entrepreneur and one of the things that i think we have to unify the country around is having an intelligent energy policy
5090906 everybody knows if we keep on going on the same track that were going and we are giving our wealth away were funding both sides of the war on terror obama said before meeting with pickens at the grand sierra resort in reno
5090907 estaba claro adem s que el hecho de que la sirenita fuera pelirroja tampoco era casual
5090908 ayer record aquella poca en que cre a que morir a sin darte siquiera un beso me parec a algo tan triste pero m s tarde ca en la cuenta de que podr a haber ocurrido algo mucho m s horrible y mucho m s triste podr a haber muerto sin haber sentido nunca la necesidad de besarte

5090912 road trip yeah im trafficin the white pleaz lord dont let me go to jail tonight
5090913 men d blir nog mamma arg p mig dock ska jag sticka ner till pauli och reta mathilda lite n r hon kommer ut om jag orkar g upp vill s ga
5090914 if you took everything you had on your floor put it in a book and sold it see what would happen
5090915 this is great i can smack my kids without worrying about cps
5090916 from tomorrow monday russia will begin the withdrawal of the military contingent which was moved to reinforce russian peacekeepers after the georgian aggression against south ossetia
5090917 such a provocation would only be staged by the russian side with the aim of keeping russian military units in the conflict zone
5090918 while the buildings did not appear to be very damaged there are clear signs of massive looting of both shops and private accommodations
5090919 we were the first in so well be the last out
5090920 in december we will have a first evaluation of the situation and we are on a clear path in the direction of nato membership
5090921 to sign any outstanding agreements as a matter of urgency to restore political stability in zimbabwe
5090922 the political conditions must be created so that this humanitarian socio economic situation in zimbabwe is addressed as a matter of urgency by an inclusive government
5090923 it is critical that we conclude negotiations as a matter of urgency because people are suffering
5090924 otherwise with the beginning of the impeachment process the situation would change drastically and the demand that is being made now for the presidents resignation would have an entirely different dimension
5090925 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it
5090926 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5090927 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5090928 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5090929 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5090930 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution
5090931 nazario said that he was asked are they dead yet
5090932 ive put in applications everywhere for everything but nobody wants to hire you if you have been indicted
5090933 my faith in the system is shaken theres no doubt about that
5090934 there are no bodies no forensic evidence no crime scene and no identities
5090935 lots of lazing around all day went for a workout in the evening and will try to get some sleep tonight but i know thats not happening anyway will have to wake at 3 30 am to sweat off the extra grammes before making weight early in the morning
5090936 along comes mccain who not only has he doesnt like to talk about his religion very much and then he talks about it openly but he has a very powerful story thats emotionally connected to the audience
5090937 its the candidate who can connect emotionally to middle america who will have the big advantage going down the stretch
5090938 it was far less about religion and a lot more about values
5090939 on this particular issue if you believe that life begins at conception and you are consistent then i cant argue with you on that
5090940 what i can do is say are there ways we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies
5090941 for me as a christian it is a sacred union gods in the mix
5090942 i can afford those civil rights to others even if i dont have that view
5090943 i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5090944 john mccains going to be a much tougher opponent for barack obama in the debates than anybody ever might have imagined just a few weeks ago
5090945 for a minute there we were just two christians worshipping together
5090946 hes a man of few words but when he tells stories he connects
5090947 i thought barack obamas answer tonight was helpful to him and addressed a couple of things because theres been a lot of doubt about his christian faith
5090948 i think he also helped to dispel the myth that hes such an elitist and hes arrogant he was quite humble in that answer and many others
5090949 i dont think he was a strong enough jurist or a legal thinker at the time for that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation
5090950 those are the judges that the evangelicals that social conservative voters want to hear from john mccains own lips that he opposes and that he would not support because the issue of judges is perhaps one of the most if not the most important issue for many social conservatives
5090951 the voters out there who went out in large numbers for george w bush that is one of the things that they want to hear from john mccain because that is something that gives them a lot more faith in john mccain
5090952 medvedev zei dat een paar dagen geleden ook al je kunt ze niet vertrouwen
5090953 ik denk niet dat ze zo makkelijk vertrekken een ding weet ik wel ik wil geen kind baren in de oorlog
5090954 we hebben gehoord op het nieuws dat de russische soldaten om gebruikte spullen verlegen zitten schoenen eten toiletbrillen en zo nou die willen we ze graag geven
5090955 zaterdag bedacht ik dit ineens omdat russische soldaten onze huizen leegroven en het is een succes veel mensen komen wat brengen of toeteren als steunbetuiging eigenlijk zie ik voor het eerst in een week weer eens mensen lachen
5090956 de successen die zijn geboekt mede gefinancierd door de wereldbank blijven beperkt tot het noordelijk deel van het meer
5090957 het volstromen van het aralmeer toont dat een menselijk milieuschandaal wel degelijk voor een deel kan worden opgelost
5090958 het noordelijk deel beslaat maar eentiende van het hele meer tweeduizend ton vis is een enorme toename maar het is slechts een fractie van 50 000 ton
5090959 ook al zouden we het kunnen het is economisch niet rendabel om dit deel van het meer weer te vullen met water
5090960 in de zomer houdt de bevolking uit de regio het water angstvallig vast men is namelijk bang dat er in de winter die zeer streng kan zijn te weinig water is om elektriciteit op te wekken
5090961 water is een gevoelig onderwerp in de regio onlangs hebben we een akkoord gesloten met kirchistan over de export van ons water ten behoeve van het opwekken van elektriciteit met de andere landen in de regio blijft de situatie precair hopelijk sluiten we in de toekomst ook met hen akkoorden
5090962 kort geleden mochten de oudste kinderen kiezen of ze op reis wilden naar zweden of naar jutland kinderen die op zweden wilden stemmen moesten bij de ene boom gaan staan en zij die naar jutland wilden bij de andere boom
5090963 democratie is als ik graag naar het bos wil maar emily liever hier wil blijven dan stemmen we daarover
5090964 wij bepalen bijvoorbeeld niet hoeveel thee ze mogen drinken wel hoeveel suiker ze er in mogen doen maar hebben we een nieuw personeelslid nodig dan vragen we aan ze wat voor een persoon ze leuk zouden vinden ze hebben dan voorstellen als iemand die goed kan troosten goed kan voorlezen of grappig is
5090965 we praten veel over het maken van keuzes en dat je niet altijd je zin kunt krijgen als de meerderheid iets anders wil
5090966 maar ik merk elke dag dat de kinderen beter naar elkaar luisteren er zijn minder conflicten omdat de kinderen zich verantwoordelijk voelen voor elkaar ik vraag me juist af moeten kinderen niet eerst leren over democratie en pas daarna de letters
5090967 maar het vergt ook veel van je want je bent gedwongen om goed te luisteren naar de kinderen ineens besef je dat misschien niet alle kinderen zin hebben om te schilderen
5090968 thuis schreeuwde ik een keer tegen hem omdat hij niet luisterde
5090969 dat is ook waar de kinderconventie van de verenigde naties van uit gaat
5090970 als ik kan zorgen dat ik niet in de weg loop ik misschien iets kan doen van wat hij bedoelt
5090971 of het nu vanuit theologisch of wetenschappelijk perspectief is boven mijn niveau
5090972 deze lotgenotenclub is n van de dingen waar ik het meeste aan heb
5090973 er komt nogal wat op tafel ervaringen met sollicitaties en eerlijke gesprekken over hoe het is om werkloos te zijn
5090974 er wordt wel beweerd dat ouderen te duur zijn maar in werkelijkheid krijg ik nooit de kans om te onderhandelen over mijn salaris voor het zover is ben ik al afgewezen ik ben best bereid om een paar loonschalen te zakken
5090975 ik voel me miskend ik word steeds afgewezen en ondertussen zie je dat het politiek een heet hangijzer wordt om mensen langer te laten doorwerken
5090976 dat zou er toe kunnen leiden dat ik nog minder kans op een baan heb maar niemand maakt echt werk van werkloze vijftigers
5090977 we zitten in een gat niemand neemt het voor onze groep op
5090978 geen enkele politieke partij doet echt wat voor hen ik heb tegen politici gezegd jullie hebben er geen idee van hoeveel verdriet en woede dat in de samenleving zaait
5090979 bedrijven proberen jongeren binnen te halen voor ze op zijn
5090980 maar je moet wel opmerken dat je in de ene sector sneller oud heet dan in de andere naar gelang het opleidingsniveau misschien dat 36 wel oud is voor vakkenvullers bij de supermarkt maar voor heel veel andere beroepen niet
5090981 dat je vanwege je leeftijd niet op een sollicitatiegesprek wordt uitgenodigd is natuurlijk bespottelijk
5090982 iedere vijfenveertiger is anders de ene is aan zijn tweede jeugd bezig de ander is al uit de kinderen en heeft geen grote verantwoordelijkheden meer
5090983 de 45 plussers die ik spreek in het kader van re ntegratietrajecten hebben vaak eerst twee uur nodig om hun woede te uiten wij laten die emmer boosheid dan over ons heenkomen horen hoe mensen hun zelfrespect kwijtraken hoe ze niet meer de straat op gaan in welk sociaal isolement ze geraakt zijn
5090984 ze komen binnen met een laag zelfbeeld het zijn vaak mensen uit de babyboom generatie die het verschrikkelijk vinden om een uitkering aan te vragen hondstrouwe werknemers die erop gerekend hadden hun hele leven hard te werken precies zoals ze dat van huis uit nog meekregen die opvoeding is overigens soms ook de oorzaak van het probleem babyboomers hebben zich bij studiekeuze vaak laten leiden door hun ouders en gekozen voor een solide zeker vak maar dat is soms niet wat echt goed bij hen past
5090985 maar het kabinetsbeleid zou wel wat kritischer moeten nagegaan worden wat er terechtkomt van afspraken en ambities de uitvoering moet beter het gaat soms nog te veel over de partijen heen zonder dat ze daar echt bij betrokken worden
5090986 vakbonden maken in de caos afspraken over het afschaffen van seniorendagen en het aanvaarden van een scholingsplicht demotie mits op basis van vrijwilligheid is ook bespreekbaar als een mogelijkheid
5090987 loonschalen kennen een plafond en periodieke verhogingen worden vaak alleen toegekend als er goed gepresteerd wordt het is niet zo dat ouderen automatisch elk jaar duurder worden
5090988 alles wat we afspreken voor ouderen lijkt soms wel dweilen met de kraan open de vooroordelen bij werkgevers blijven bestaan
5090989 in het mkb waar werkgevers gemiddeld zeven mensen in dienst hebben zijn juist heel veel ouderen werkzaam
5090990 een bakker of drogist hangt een advertentie op zijn raam en is vervolgens afhankelijk van wie zich op de lokale arbeidsmarkt aanbiedt in het mkb zijn ze er vaak niet specifiek op uit om jongeren aan te nemen maar dat ouderen minder productief zijn dan jongeren en meer kosten aan secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden kan wel een probleem zijn voor kleine deeltijdbanen is dat nog te overzien maar als een bakker echt hoge loonkosten moet maken kan hij moeilijk tien cent meer voor zijn brood vragen
5090991 het feit dat ouderen in een vorige baan veel verdienden en dienovereenkomstige kosten maken mag niet het probleem van de werkgever zijn
5090992 de kosten van hypotheek of gezin zijn natuurlijk in de eerste plaats de verantwoordelijkheid van de werknemer zelf maar er is vaak weinig erkenning voor de ervaring die oudere werknemers ook meebrengen
5090993 voor 55 plussers die vanuit werkloosheid gaan werken zou na acht weken de overheid het loon moeten doorbetalen
5090994 ouderen zijn niet vaker ziek dan jongeren maar ls ze ziek worden blijven ze dat wel langer dat kan dus voor werkgevers een belemmering zijn om hen aan te nemen
5090995 dat is niet doeltreffend bovendien is het heel lastig om na veel teleurstellingen weer het gevoel te krijgen dat je zelf aan het stuur staat
5090996 je moet je daarbij wel afvragen w t voor werk er dan gevonden wordt
5090997 van onze club van negen hebben in een jaar tijd twee mensen een baan gevonden e n kon weer aan de slag bij zijn oude werkgever een ander kreeg pas bijstand als hij zijn woonboot zou verkopen en opeten dat wilde hij niet dus hij nam een baan aan als algemeen medewerker bij een c1000 supermarkt het werk is ver beneden zijn niveau maar er zat niets anders op mijn ervaring is dat ik word afgewezen als ik niet als manager solliciteer omdat ik te hoog gekwalificeerd ben wat vervolgens overblijft zijn werkzaamheden waar men altijd wel menskracht kan gebruiken zoals bollenpellen in het westland ik kijk niet op dat werk neer maar ik vind die kapitaalvernietiging van opleiding en kennis mensonterend maar op dit moment zie ik nergens een uitweg
5090998 alles wat niet optimaal rendeert wordt uitbesteed zo zijn bedrijven ook omgegaan met mensen die niet meer naar verwachting presteerden na ontslag zijn die probleemgevallen doorgeschoven naar sociale diensten maar daar ontbrak de persoonlijke aanpak en moest ook effici nt worden gewerkt in sommige gevallen werd daarom geaccepteerd dat mensen niet meer aan een baan komen bijvoorbeeld omdat iemand te oud is of laag opgeleid de uitkeringskosten worden dan door de gemeente genomen zonder dat er goed gepoogd wordt om een baan te vinden
5090999 er is wel iets veranderd in het denken van sociale diensten maar de resultaten daarvan blijven beperkt ik denk dat het achteraf gezien beter geweest was als de werkgever zelf de verantwoordelijkheid had gehouden om iemand in een andere functie te zetten dan was de werknemer meer gemotiveerd geweest om er het beste uit te halen en nieuwe vaardigheden te leren maar de verzorgingsstaat heeft ons die stimulans ontnomen
5091000 zijn wij soms circusdieren die in een tent moeten spelen
5091001 daar horen mensen met een radicaal en een heel gematigd verleden bij dat is niet iets om je voor te schamen maar om trots op te zijn
5091002 acties die de democratie ondermijnen zullen nooit door groenlinks worden gesteund of geaccepteerd mensen die het daarmee oneens zijn horen bij een partij die een ander standpunt heeft
5091003 demonstraties petities en ludieke acties zetten de soms noodzakelijke druk op de politieke besluitvorming
5091004 dat betekent dat je weliswaar de wet overtreedt maar dat je de begrenzing van de democratische rechtsstaat erkent en aanvaardt
5091005 de wet overtreden kan en wil ik van mijn collega parlementari rs niet accepteren noch goedpraten
5091006 je vernielt een mooi landschap en raakt zo het unieke zicht op zutphen kwijt
5091007 de kom van de oude ijssel is een prachtig en bijzonder gebied vanuit de stad kijk je op het groen je hoort de koeien loeien ziet kieviten en ooievaars nog steeds is alles op menselijke maat je zou er zutphen onherstelbaar schade mee doen als je daar zoveel huizen neerzet
5091008 er zal voor de veiligheid iets moeten gebeuren rond de ijssel of we dat nou leuk vinden of niet
5091009 maar dit lijkt een gelegenheidsargument om een strekdam van vinexwoningen neer te leggen haaks op de rivier we hebben al die huizen niet nodig de gemeente geeft ook toe dat ze niet allemaal voor zutphen en omgeving zijn
5091010 dit is nog geen krimpregio vanuit puur zutphens perspectief zitten we niet te springen om 3000 woningen maar we hebben in de stedendriehoek de afspraak dat we de steden versterken om het buitengebied te sparen dus zutphen neemt zijn deel maar we bouwen niet voor leegstand we bekijken de woningbehoefte elke twee jaar opnieuw en natuurlijk zetten we die 3000 huizen niet in n keer neer dat kan de markt niet aan
5091011 la fuerza especial la formaci n invencible en acci n
5091012 sem gravidade de qualquer esp cie e est recomposto e voltou para casa
5091013 not only because it is very close to the finish line but just the feeling it gives me it is a very clean feeling a very strong feeling you get to take in so much more of the scenery just because you do not have to worry about what you are riding over with your bike and just getting to see the different places by foot rather than by bike
5091014 and knowing that we are going to their home turf and be competing with their own crowd and stuff does give you a little bit more pressure but it also kind of gives us an advantage too just because we will be going in there and we are working harder than ever to beat that
5091015 as i have gotten older i have just realized i love working out all day
5091016 this is the one sport where it is truly an all day commitment six days a week and i like waking up every morning and seeing my teammates and hopping in the pool it is hard work but it is a great life
5091017 i think japan is probably one of the most unpredictable teams in the tournament
5091018 their attacking style is lots of numbers quick movement of the ball and all 11 players involved in moving the ball forward so it is very tough to defend them
5091019 wir m ssen die situation beenden dass wir in wilmington an jedem tag f nf millionen dollar verlust machen
5091020 partnership between dhl an ups will allow us to control world freight prices
5091021 wir m ssen uns bald entscheiden ob wir den stecker ziehen
5091022 now faith is the assurance of things hoped for the conviction of things not seen
5091023 if youre always talking about yourself you may not be tuned in
5091024 would have serious consequences on relations between russia and the european union
5091025 people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
5091026 we have to invent a new language with regard to russia that is what the european union is trying to do
5091027 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since august 7
5091028 russia will begin the withdrawal of the military contingent which was moved to reinforce russian peacekeepers after the georgian aggression against south ossetia
5091029 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5091030 which say to the seers see not and to the prophets prophecy no unto us right things speak to us smooth things prophecy deceits
5091031 a wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land the prophets prophesy falsely and the priests bear rule by their means and my people love to have it so and what will you do in the end thereof
5091032 are weighty and powerful but his bodily presence is weak and contemptible
5091033 then the lord said unto me the prophets prophesy lies in my name i sent then not neither have i commanded them neither spake unto them they prophecy unto you a false vision and divination and a thing of nought and the deceit of their heart jer
5091034 thus saith the lord of hosts harken not unto the words of the prophets that prophecy unto you they make you vain they speak a vision of their own heart and not out of the mouth of the lord
5091035 now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart and of a good conscience and of faith unfeigned from which some have swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling desiring to be teachers of the law and understand neither what they say nor whereof they affirm
5091036 woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith these ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone
5091037 if any man teach otherwise and consent not to wholesome words even the words of our lord jesus christ and to the doctrine which is according to godliness he is proud knowing nothing but doting about questions and strife of words whereof cometh envy strife railings evil surmisings perverse disputings of men corrupt minds and destitute of the truth supposing that gain is godliness from such withdraw thyself
5091038 woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte and when he is made ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves
5091039 but there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privily shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the lord that bought them and bring upon themselves swift destruction and many shall follow their pernicious ways by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of and through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not and their damnation slumbereth not
5091040 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5091041 but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave
5091042 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5091043 we are waiting for more support from other countries because this is not a war between russian and georgia its a war between civilization and barbarism
5091044 i do not know where my children are and you can imagine how i feel about it
5091045 we moeten veel dichter bij de belevingswereld van onze luisteraars komen te staan we zoeken naar de toon van de wereld draait door het mag allemaal wel iets luchtiger gevarieerder sneller en populairder worden
5091046 ik ben totaal niet ge rriteerd ik vind alleen de vraagstelling een beetje voor de hand liggend laat ik het zo zeggen
5091047 ikke niet jij bent daar toch voor dat wil je toch van mij weten of niet
5091048 ja dat klopt wel maar als ik vraag naar robben dan leek me dat een vrij logische vraag en
5091049 maar toch ook niet helemaal want wat gebeurt er na afloop perschef kees jansma en de bondscoach evalueren het stukje dat u net gezien heeft met de microfoons open
5091050 bertje ja ik heb het een beetje gehad met dat bijdehand doen
5091051 maar daarom is het goed als je dat vindt ik weet niet of je dat bewust deed dat je daarna dus heel goed uitgebreid antwoord gaf
5091052 ja heel goed dan weet hij namelijk ook waar het om gaat ik heb een aantal collegas nu ook ingeseind dat ze een ander soort vragen moeten gaan stellen in plaats van gesloten vragen open vragen over voetballen
5091053 that when your newly born grandchild holds your little finger in his little fist youre hooked for life

5091055 y como sobre mi mismo no tengo para contar ni dos folios
5091056 were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5091057 the greatest part is we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle
5091058 hes just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us thats what we have to keep doing is to try and win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground
5091059 he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5091060 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5091061 what were doing here is a little bit of practicing for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car carl edwards did a great job the pit crew did a great job
5091062 it just came down to when he beat us off of pit road
5091063 that was it for us we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys we were good on that one run that one set of tires but that was pretty much what we had
5091064 we just didnt have enough for the no 99 there at the end we werent able to get through the corners as fast as carl was
5091065 we were a nine out of a 10 it seems like and those other guys were a 10 out of a 10
5091066 just to gamble a little bit on staying on track we knew at worst that we would still finish in the top five it was something to take a shot we certainly learned from it if we had to do it all over again wed probably still do it again
5091067 for the past two years crude has followed the dollar almost lock step
5091068 the strength weve seen in the dollar is almost certainly helping bring crude down at this point as you move backward it actually acts as a stimulus on the economy
5091069 as for housing starts i think everyone is expecting them to remain soft ppi wont be much of a market mover as commodities have been moving lower which makes last months numbers irrelevant
5091070 i dont think were out of the woods yet on financials because i dont think were out of the woods on housing
5091071 when we have new orders thats going to tell you are people ready to put stuff on the shelf
5091072 its important because one of the big drags on the gdp in the second quarter was inventory
5091073 any geopolitical developments whether it be the iranian situation or further developments with russia and georgia those will influence oil markets
5091074 as he turned away he turned back and said i thought about it
5091075 this is one of those times where everything seemed to be clicking
5091076 wed like to have scored on the first drive all in all it was good i was ok with it
5091077 it worked out better than i thought it would not that i thought it would go badly
5091078 i thought i threw the ball well and moved around ok
5091079 very much in control of the huddle like he always is and very much in control of the game and that allowed us to be in control as an offense as a unit we felt like everything that we were going to run was going to work
5091080 he moved the team down the field and put us in a position to score
5091081 does that sound a little awkward or funny maybe a little bit believe me i feel very comfortable here the guys have been great theyve welcomed me i feel like im here for a reason as ive told the guys im here for one reason to help you win ill do whatever that takes and i hope it works out
5091082 obviously a lot of things have gone on the last few months
5091083 im not going to sit here and say i havent second guessed decisions not only this year but along the way one thing i know for sure when i stepped on the field as i did tonight i knew i made the right decision
5091084 were a team and im just one piece of this puzzle
5091085 at some point we have to go on and focus on what were trying to do as a team and not on one person
5091086 hes definitely much more relaxed than you would think he was
5091087 he has been in this offense for what a week as fast as he has been getting everything its ridiculous
5091088 and hed be like man the pizza is good today
5091089 i just wanted to make sure i took every single moment in and every single swim in every single moment with my teammates so i would remember them
5091090 to swim in the same era as him has been awesome
5091091 weve been talking about mark spitz for 36 years now
5091092 i dont know if im going to be alive when they stop talking about this bloke you wonder if we are going to see someone as good as this again
5091093 being able to have something like that to shoot for it made those days when i was tired and i didnt want to be there
5091094 im just thankful for him having done what he did
5091095 the sport of swimming has come a long way so far and i think it can go even further
5091096 mike is opening a lot of doors with what hes doing
5091097 i just want to lay in my own bed for five minutes at least and just relax
5091098 one of the things im really looking forward to is getting back to baltimore
5091099 hes more naturally suited for longer distances itll be change for him but i think itll be a good one

5091104 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5091105 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5091106 no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempt to legalize ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to its knees and undermine our democratic system
5091107 georgia is a sovereign state and the territorial integrity of the state must be provided for
5091108 i wish peace for my country and for our children we do not want to live in fear
5091109 while i was shopping just across the street i heard a huge explosion

5091134 they say this other guy is unpatriotic or this guy likes french people thats what they said about kerry
5091135 they try to make it out like democrats arent tough enough arent macho enough its the same strategy
5091136 respectfully im going to disagree with you on mccain and his service
5091137 this is an issue that is not on the table and just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
5091138 and we have been supportive of the democratic elections that took place in pakistan in fact advocated for them
5091139 president musharraf has been a good ally and everyone knows that we disagreed with his decision in terms of the state of emergency that he declared but he kept to his word he took off the uniform
5091140 pakistan and the united states have a joint interest in fighting terror because these terrorists are not just after the us and afghanistan
5091141 theyre also after pakistan as demonstrated by the fact that they killed former pakistan premier benazir bhutto
5091142 thats what were concentrating on and helping pakistan to sustain its economy to build its schools its health we have a broad pakistan policy

5091211 what this study actually proves is that search moves the branding needle for cpg
5091212 its really good news for brand marketers because there are really strong efficiencies they can find in search marketing the price for this branding value is zero because its being served anyway and marketers pay for clicks not number of impressions at this point the cost per click in these categories is very low
5091213 the implication is if youre present your awareness goes up and if youre not present your awareness goes down
5091214 it seems like from the results that the punishment for a challenger brand is very high for not being in the paid listings so they really should be there
5091215 and its also cost effective for them its probably cheaper than a tv campaign and its much easier to raise the brand perception
5091216 i think our brands have such a strong presence that its nice to be in the first position but i dont think we have to be there
5091217 im not convinced its worth paying the extra money or the extra effort to get there yet
5091218 its kind of like the klondike before the gold rush
5091219 if all branding clients go and do search for branding it will change
5091220 yes its growing and we have helped drive a lot of growth

5091298 i think people in china have suffered too much and for all that sacrifice all we get is more money more cars taller buildings its just not worth it if chinese culture doesnt make a contribution to the world that be a great pity
5091299 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5091300 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5091301 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5091302 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5091303 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5091304 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5091305 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5091306 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5091307 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5091308 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5091309 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5091310 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5091311 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5091312 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5091313 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5091314 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5091315 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5091316 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5091317 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5091318 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5091319 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5091320 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5091321 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5091322 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5091323 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5091324 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5091325 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5091326 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5091327 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5091328 this is a planning took where all things are going
5091329 o time melhorou mostrou uma agressividade que antes n s n o v amos e dominou o flamengo
5091330 a gente trabalha para a equipe criar o maior n mero de chances e ficar mais pr ximo da vit ria mas o resultado disso s vem com um maior n mero de jogos o time melhorou mostrou uma agressividade que antes n s n o v amos e dominou o flamengo
5091331 isso o que nos deixa confiantes para sair dessa o time jogou bem e criou chances enquanto isso acontece voc tem esperan as pior seria se tivesse achado o empate por acaso
5091332 o time levou gols que n o saem a toda hora no primeiro a bola bateu em dois jogadores nossos e entrou no ngulo no segundo a bola estava com a gente perdemos e saiu o p nalti que no meu modo de ver n o foi muito claro
5091333 a exig ncia com a gente parece que muito maior em dois jogos a cobran a toda em cima de mim n o por a todos t m sua parcela de culpa mas a nossa bem menor avisou a equipe evoluiu e isso que precisa ser visto pois com pouco tempo n o d para fazer milagres
5091334 todos tiveram oportunidade de ver uma equipe dedicada que se entregou do primeiro ao ltimo minuto de jogo as oportunidades criadas comprovam isso e pelo que fizemos poder amos ter feito tr s ou quatro gols o flamengo criou duas oportunidades e marcou os gols
5091335 o ibson for ou a barra e o rbitro que estava encoberto deu o p nalti o ser humano pass vel de erros mas o santos foi prejudicado
5091336 agora n s temos que buscar substitui es para o patr cio eu posso usar o wilton goiano mas para o gavil n tenho que ver quais s o as nossas op es
5091337 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5091338 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5091339 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5091340 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5091341 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5091342 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5091343 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5091344 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5091345 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5091346 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5091347 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5091348 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5091349 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5091350 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5091351 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5091352 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5091353 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5091354 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5091355 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5091356 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5091357 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5091358 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5091359 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5091360 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5091361 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5091362 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5091363 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5091364 we are excited to have molly with us at the iowa bicycle coalition she will bring experience and enthusiasm to the program
5091365 that wasnt so bad maybe i can do this without the nitrous
5091366 turn it to 100 oxygen close your mouth and breathe through your nose
5091367 im sorry did i forget to mention i have issues with being tortured you might just want to make a note of that in my chart
5091368 let those who are among us without sin cast the first stone
5091369 bad penalties hurt us i was talking to coach wade phillips and we were talking about how its like a turnover we have to stop it we overcame them a little bit but they would catch up to us eventually
5091370 were putting ourselves in bad situations just a lot of little things are holding us back no one can overcome making a lot of mistakes we just need to start staying out of these situations
5091371 we had opportunities and we didnt take advantage of them
5091372 we moved the ball and then there was a penalty and that hurt us those kind of things hurt us but i think were going to be all right
5091373 we practiced with denver all week and we did well
5091374 they changed up their whole game plan that is good on their part
5091375 i threw the ball well today and had a good camp this week
5091376 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5091377 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5091378 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5091379 i want you to come to know of the concern and dedication that this simple woman had for islam as described by those who knew her a dedication that was manifested by way of actions that were very simple and easy yet seldom carried out by those who are able
5091380 invite them to migrate from their lands to the land of the muhajirin and inform them that if they do so they will have all the privileges and obligations of the muhajirin
5091381 where are the men why do i have to be the one standing up here and doing this work
5091382 she wrote three guides for members who wanted to teach others about islam on the groups website siddiqui explained how to run a dawah table an informational booth used at school events to educate people about and persuade them to convert to islam
5091383 imagine our humble but sincere dawah effort turning into a major dawah movement in this country just imagine it and us reaping the reward of everyone who accepts islam through this movement through years to come think and plan big may allah give this strength and sincerity to us so that our humble effort continue and expands until america becomes a muslim land
5091384 not going out of her way to be noticed by anybody or to be anyones friend she just came out here to teach us about allah and english wasnt even her first language
5091385 she shared with us that we should never make excuses for who we are
5091386 how many people in this room own more than one pair of boots
5091387 so donate them to these bosnians who are about to face a brutal winter
5091388 this is a woman who attempted to blast her way out of captivity
5091389 it was her decision as she refused to by seen by a male doctor
5091390 there remains only one obstacle from which the enemy calls him from and this is an obstacle that he must face if anyone were to be saved from this obstacle it would have been the messengers and prophets of allah and the noblest of his creation this is the obstacle of satan unleashing his troops upon the believer with various types of harm by way of the hand the tongue and the heart this occurs in accordance with the degree of goodness that exists within the believer so the higher he is in degree the more the enemy unleashes his troops and helps them against him and overwhelms him with his followers and allies in various ways there is no way around this obstacle because the firmer he is in calling to allah and fulfilling his commands the more the enemy becomes intent upon deceiving him with foolish people so he has essentially put on his body armor in this obstacle and has taken it upon himself to confront the enemy for allahs sake and in his name and his worship in doing so is the worship of the best of worshippers
5091391 if ghayrah protective jealousy leaves a persons heart his faith will follow it
5091392 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5091393 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5091394 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5091395 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5091396 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5091397 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5091398 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5091399 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5091400 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5091401 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5091402 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5091403 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5091404 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5091405 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5091406 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5091407 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5091408 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5091409 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5091410 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5091411 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5091412 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5091413 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5091414 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5091415 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5091416 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5091417 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5091418 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5091419 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5091420 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5091421 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5091422 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5091423 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5091424 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5091425 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
5091426 a baby who is being breast fed should be given clear liquids for two consecutive feedings before breastfeeding is resumed a bottle fed baby should be given formula diluted to half its strength for the first 24 hours after developing symptoms of dehydration
5091427 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
5091428 you have value on the ground more than you spent
5091429 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
5091430 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
5091431 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5091432 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5091433 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
5091434 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
5091435 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
5091436 i need someone to come sit up front with me
5091437 i am incredibly excited to be involved with such a prestigious show
5091438 reviewing films for a living is a thrill and now that i will be a critic for at the movies it is an honor and huge responsibility that i look forward to
5091439 i am thrilled and honored beyond words to be joining the series
5091440 as a movie fanatic this is my dream job without question i certainly have very big shoes to fill

5091475 at the start of the year we lost a few players so we had a quick chat about it and moved on
5091476 we have to do the job each week and not worry about who is in and who is out just be confident in whoever is around you
5091477 weve had probably one of the worst injury tolls in the nrl weve lost four starting players zillman withers carney and centre phil graham and i know a lot of other clubs say theyve had bad runs with injuries but so have we
5091478 we try not to dwell on it and it doesnt matter who we put on the park i think every player who has put on a green jumper this year has played with pride
5091479 we totally rely on our juniors and thats something the club has to be commended for
5091480 were missing a nine a seven a one and our no 4 in phil graham so theres plenty of reasons i guess you could say weve drawn the short straw but we havent looked at it like that
5091481 were just playing with a lot of confidence were getting a lot of value out of our big guys up front our halves have been playing fantastic footy and guys who probably have just been content with making the side or getting in on the bench have really stepped up and want to make a difference
5091482 thats football they try to get under your skin and youve got to try not to lose it
5091483 the first half today was as good as we can play
5091484 we went into the match with a real determination to do well we didnt win anything last season and wanted to show what we are all about now

5091554 a couple of u s stock funds or even just one a total stock market index fund plus a foreign stock fund and a bond fund are all most people need to cover the bases

5091562 can you provide any documentation or evidence of your claim that two different securities which attempt to track the same index will not cause an investor to run afoul of the wash sale rule
5091563 tax courts have ruled that if you swap the securities of one company for the securities of an unrelated company then the securities are not identical and a tax loss is allowed therefore swapping a vanguard mutual fund for a schwab mutual fund should not create a tax wash lets apply the same precedence to index funds if you sold the vanguard 500 fund at a loss and simultaneously purchased the schwab s amp p 500 index fund for the same amount in my opinion a legitimate tax loss in created
5091564 theres some debate but no direct authority on the question of whether two mutual funds keying off the same index are substantially identical for purposes of the wash sale rule can you sell one s amp p 500 index fund at a loss and buy a different s amp p 500 fund the same day without having a wash sale because there is no direct authority dealing with this question reasonable minds may disagree its always possible to identify differences between funds managed by different companies such as expense ratios and tax load some people conclude on this basis that funds maintained by two different companies are never substantially identical my feeling is that those differences arent enough to prevent the two funds from being substantially identical the point of the wash sale rule is to determine whether youve changed your position relative to the market if you can lay the price graph for your new investment on top of the price graph for the old one and never see a significant disparity as would be the case for two high quality s amp p 500 funds the investments should be considered substantially identical for purposes of the wash sale rule

5091682 it is indeed shocking how a small place such as azamgarh continues to breed terrorists and up police are caught napping after every big catch
5091683 local criminals have managed to forge links with international terrorist outfits to execute some of the most grievous terror attacks in recent times
5091684 congregations called in the name of islam attract millions from all over the country and it is here that the venom of terrorism is spewed but for reasons linked to vote bank politics no one in the government dares to even raise an eyebrow
5091685 its such a sensitive issue that if someone even broaches the subject in a meeting he is made to feel like a criminal
5091686 if the police fail to gather enough evidence scientific methods such as narco analysis and brain mapping will play a major role in bringing out the truth
5091687 in the absence of pota co accused can be booked under the indian evidence act
5091688 everything thereon will be based on the charge sheet which will in turn be based on the circumstantial and material evidence the police collect forensics can also play a major role
5091689 this will not only solve the problem of dumping the environmental pressures would also be solved
5091690 we will study worldwide practices and implement the best model
5091691 since it is the first time in india that such a project is being undertaken we wanted to verify all the aspects before implementation

5091693 after completing basic research and ground work for the project techno
5091694 it was a grind mentally and physically to bear down and make pitches
5091695 the position were in winning series is what were shooting for
5091696 everybody goes through it well go out on the road and try to turn this thing around
5091697 through three at bats i didnt feel too good but i got a hit at the most important part of the game
5091698 if i make the play its a great play if not like today im sure somebody is going to call and say you should have stayed back thats baseball
5091699 those are guys that can swing the bat and hit the ball out of the park so you never know you want to keep tacking on runs when you play a team like that
5091700 theyre trying you just got to keep on being positive with them bring them back to where they were before
5091701 i dont want to lose obviously its not easy but the effort its there guys want to catch the ball they want to hit the ball they want to throw strikes theyre just not doing it right now
5091702 it aint always easy and this year has been tough for us i think it should make you hungrier to come out and play starting tuesday you never want to be a part of something like 100 losses but you cant play 500 the rest of the season unless you take care of tuesday night
5091703 what can you do you cant flip flop the whole team with another 25 guys all they can do is give me the effort this is what we have and this is what were going to finish the season with hopefully we can get better
5091704 i just didnt execute some of my pitches got away with some guys kept making plays behind me when they score some runs it makes it easier to win
5091705 they had a couple of different defining moments where they could have jumped up and changed the momentum of the game
5091706 its not like they werent trying 7 2 its a lot closer ballgame than that

5091774 thats why were looking at pontoon boats because fuel is a concern on the lake
5091775 we have noticed this year far fewer folks on the lake or at least far fewer riding on the lake
5091776 a lot of people will raft up and not burn their fuel
5091777 the economy certainly had an effect but its not as bad as one would think
5091778 im looking to see if i can capitalize on the slow market for boats and pick up a good deal

5091786 nothing is happening and we are no closer to a deal than we were six weeks ago
5091787 every day the members of screen actors guild are losing hundreds of thousands of dollars in unrealized wage increases while working under an expired tv theatrical contract
5091788 in failing to bargain realistically with the amptp and remove unattainable items from the table our negotiating team controlled by the current hollywood leadership has pursued an agenda that has more to do with politics than with securing a beneficial contract and has betrayed the trust of the membership
5091789 the new york members of the national board of screen actors guild insist that our negotiators signal to the amptp sags willingness to bargain in good faith and remove any impediments to the achievement of a deal if there is no clear and obvious movement forward in the negotiating process by august 25th we demand that our negotiators request a federal mediator be brought in to facilitate the negotiating process and finally get our members a contract our members are losing over 1 7 million every week that we continue to work under the expired tv theatrical agreement this must not continue
5091790 all of us in ny hollywood and across the country should be concerned about how this failure to reach an agreement is impacting our members they have already suffered significantly as a result of the wga strike and now they are experiencing an additional loss of work made worse when they can find a job by having to work without a contract under old terms and conditions there are some who feel we have all the time in the world to make this deal we on the ny board do not
5091791 this is an advisory motion of the new york division board of directors
5091792 as recently as several weeks ago the national board of directors provided significant guidance to the national negotiating committee and sags negotiators in the form of a unanimous resolution declaring that two new media principles offered by management are unacceptable
5091793 contrary to some characterizations included in this advisory motion the negotiators have held substantive discussions with numerous representatives of the employers and the amptp over the last several weeks and will continue to do so in an effort to secure a fair deal for sag members
5091794 mediation is an option available any time the parties mutually agree to it
5091795 as per our standard procedure this division advisory motion will be conveyed to the national board of directors along with any advisories that may be issued by the regional branch division or hollywood division boards
5091796 this advisory motion is not in the best interests of new york division sag members or any sag members across the country it could tend to delay and prolong the negotiations by emboldening management with a false belief that sag actors are split on the issues
5091797 the plainly political nature of this action is cynical and unfortunate it is an attempt to damage sags negotiations and new york division members may well wonder why this action is being taken by their elected representatives
5091798 on wednesday august 13 2008 the sag national negotiating committee met for an update and was at no time informed of the new york division advisory motion which had been passed by the new york division board in executive session two days prior on monday august 11
5091799 new york division board members including the new york division president and negotiating committee co chair were in attendance at the negotiating committee meeting and did not mention the advisory motion these representatives of sag actors in the new york division failed to provide the negotiating committee with important and critical information in their possession at the time

5091815 home prices in the u s are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
5091816 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
5091817 a necessary condition for an end to the current global financial crisis
5091818 its the imbalance of supply and demand which causes prices to go down but its ultimately the valuation process of the use of the commodity which tells you where the bottom is
5091819 for example the grain markets can have a huge excess of corn or wheat but the price never goes to zero itll stabilize at some level of prices where people are willing to hold the excess inventory we have little history but the same thing is surely true in housing as well we will get to the point where there will be willing holders of vacant single family dwellings and that will no longer act to depress the price level
5091820 theres no credible argument for bailing out bear stearns and not the gses
5091821 they should have wiped out the shareholders nationalized the institutions with legislation that they are to be reconstituted with necessary taxpayer support to make them financially viable as five or 10 individual privately held units
5091822 if they are too big to fail make them smaller
5091823 the law that stipulates that gses are not backed by the full faith and credit of the u s government is disbelieved the market believes the government guarantee is there foreigners believe the guarantee is there the only fiscal change is for someone to change the bookkeeping
5091824 its hard to escape the conclusion that at some point our extraordinary housing boom cannot continue indefinitely into the future
5091825 while local economies may experience significant speculative price imbalances a national severe price distortion seems most unlikely in the united states given its size and diversity
5091826 i think the worst of this may well be over
5091827 the most effective initiative though politically difficult would be a major expansion in quotas for skilled immigrants

5091835 to sign any outstanding agreements as a matter of urgency to restore political stability in zimbabwe
5091836 the political conditions must be created so that this humanitarian socio economic situation in zimbabwe is addressed as a matter of urgency by an inclusive government
5091837 it is critical that we conclude negotiations as a matter of urgency because people are suffering

5091844 i could win at home but i would never win in the studio
5091845 ive always been interested in doing things i havent done before and so thats basically what it boils down to ive done live but ive never done this sort of format before so its a genuine challenge
5091846 when opportunity knocks ive always argued youve got to have a pretty reasonable excuse not to do it so why wouldnt you lifes short and i assume i can do it well soon find out
5091847 i would never enter it myself there are lots of things i dont have but one of the things i do have is a relatively good general knowledge im not an expert in any specific area but ive got a reasonable general knowledge so i would be potentially the sort of person who could back themselves to enter the show but i would never do it because i would freak out under pressure id crack
5091848 i could win at home but i would never win in the studio
5091849 i reckon you could have some of the brainiest people in the world go on and lose it versus people who could battle their way through with a pretty reasonable general knowledge and still come out a winner
5091850 my main tip is just to relax from what ive seen its the people who panic early on who lose out they may well know the answer but they freak out
5091851 its actually a very complex show to do or so they keep telling me
5091852 watching it from a hosts point of view is fascinating youre not there to help the contestants youre there to an extent to be their friend
5091853 theyre very different to each other and they bring their own style to the show and ill bring my own style to the new zealand side of it
5091854 ive been around long enough you either think im a big pillock or you think im all right so itll just be me
5091855 for as long as you can remember you have been a pleaser depending on others to give you an identity you need not look at that only in a negative way you wanted to give your heart to others and you did so quickly and easily but now you are being asked to let go of all these self made props and trust that god is enough for you you must stop being a pleaser and reclaim your identity as a free self
5091856 well im not a historian that goes through all of the pieces of legislation john mccain has worked on is sadly amusing
5091857 people shouldnt have to have government tell them how to get their health care
5091858 so youd rather have big insurance tell them because thats what weve got now
5091859 he has asked that all computers be gas and oil powered
5091860 he has asked that all computers be gas and oil powered
5091861 oh please mr mccain give me a job in your administration look im saying all the right things this governor job in la sucks i spent all this time learning all this right wing bs and adopting this southern drawl how was i supposed to know carl rove would overplay his hand and the neo cons would drag us into the worst foreign policy blunder since vietnam

5091867 people are different people have different chemistry i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right
5091868 what will we do for days without computers and projects
5091869 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5091870 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5091871 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5091872 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5091873 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5091874 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5091875 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it
5091876 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5091877 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5091878 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5091879 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5091880 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution
5091881 we got to show up and watch the ceremony at city hall and that was a definite plus of making our visit our here to boise
5091882 we havent got quite the number of competitors we expected but were still having a great turn out with great events all over the valley
5091883 approximately 6 500 tickets to the event will be allotted for seating in six different venues throughout the 120 acre saddleback campus
5091884 then last week the message changed and said a limited number of tickets would be available this wednesday monday night the message was revised again saying all tickets had been distributed
5091885 church officials said theyd hoped to have some tickets available for the public but ran out when they couldnt satisfy demand among church members who got the first crack at tickets that sold for 500 to 2 000
5091886 in 1954 congress approved an amendment by sen lyndon johnson to prohibit 501 c 3 organizations which includes charities and churches from engaging in any political campaign activity to the extent congress has revisited the ban over the years it has in fact strengthened the ban the most recent change came in 1987 when congress amended the language to clarify that the prohibition also applies to statements opposing candidates
5091887 and the king shall answer and say unto them verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me

5091890 para haver harmonia social entre ajuda e respeito rec proco entre os cidad os preciso imperioso combater as grandes desigualdades
5091891 the moment we think this problem in washington is not going to get solved we have to pull the plug because all were doing is wasting money
5091892 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5091893 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5091894 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5091895 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5091896 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5091897 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5091898 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5091899 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5091900 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5091901 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5091902 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5091903 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5091904 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5091905 who are open to doing something on the production side
5091906 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5091907 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5091908 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5091909 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5091910 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5091911 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5091912 these couples are mainly from poor communities and could not afford the big costs of a normal wedding
5091913 i know some people turn their nose down a bit at the prospect that people could save 10 or so on a tank of petrol but we dont he told abc tv
5091914 we think its a very important part of having a more competitive petrol market and we intend to fight for it in the senate
5091915 well we do so we are going to get up there and fight for this measure
5091916 its an important measure and we think its important because it can help people save a small amount of money admittedly from time to time
5091917 but thats important to a lot of people who are under financial pressure
5091918 jumped the gun in supporting moves to introduce fuelwatch to south australia four years ago
5091919 but then i set up a parliamentary inquiry he told channel 9
5091920 i was part of that inquiry process and it became quite clear that if you want to tackle the whole issue of fuel prices effectively the best way to do that is to tackle the issue of competition amongst the big four oil companies
5091921 what horse trading implies is that youll support something you dont believe in in order to get something else through
5091922 the problem with horse trading is sometimes youll end up with a donkey or even worse a trojan horse so i need to decide things on their merit and issues have to be taken on their merits

5091925 katy is not a homosexual but i fear she has been led astray by the hollywood crowd
5091926 i pray all the time that god will work through her and help her find salvation
5091927 some are too revealing and her father has had words with her about it like any child she is going through a period of rebellion
5091928 it wouldnt look good for me particularly in my boxers
5091929 if i was built like brad pitt id do it all the time wouldnt you
5091930 brad went there builds houses he can do a lot of other things with his time

5091933 it was just so grossly remiss that i have not had a christmas album it was just ridiculous
5091934 i was told at one point that they christmas albums didnt make any money but thats not the point at all
5091935 id be at home cooking and enjoying the holidays and listening to everybody but myself i wasnt enjoying that
5091936 to be honest you kind of think about all the bad things that could happen to you
5091937 you dont want to go two thirds of an inning and be all over the place in that aspect im happy i was able to get a win
5091938 i was impressed with how he bounced back from that first inning
5091939 he got through a very tough part of the order in the fifth
5091940 that was a great sign when his pitch count was rising and he was probably tiring he hung in there
5091941 it was kind of strange because with the first hitter you have some anxiety and nerves
5091942 but i got him on two pitches then i started to miss the zone and i had to struggle i think i was trying too hard
5091943 we scored three runs early and couldnt polish him off
5091944 luckily i was able to flare the ball for a hit
5091945 my mechanics are a little off and i have to work on that
5091946 i fell behind too many hitters its frustrating because its usually been one inning
5091947 sooner or later our president is going to say or do something that goes too far and then it will start
5091948 what happened here in the last week certainly came as a shock not only to georgia but to a lot of others as well
5091949 a lot of people will as a result of this want to build a closer relationship with their western partners as quickly as possible
5091950 i would like to believe it will be russia because we are fraternal nations and have to support each other
5091951 russia will not disappear tomorrow as well as in a century or two
5091952 we will always wake up and it will be there not canada
5091953 the assumption of the post 1991 settlement has been that the old russia is in the past that it is not a country that invades its neighbors
5091954 basically the entire european security architecture is based on this premise
5091955 smart russians keep silent and they still think about their fate in ukraine
5091956 ukraine is under the same threat the same kind of damocles sword
5091957 will consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
5091958 we hope our republican colleagues will join in a bipartisan effort not only to increase domestic supply but also to help consumers and to protect the environment
5091959 if speaker pelosi and her democratic colleagues were truly serious about increasing production of american energy and lowering the price of gasoline they would call congress back into session immediately to vote on our all of the above energy plan rather than taking a five week break away from washington
5091960 another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices
5091961 we are going to put them to the test on this issue
5091962 the safir ambassador rocket was successfully launched all its systems are iranian made
5091963 we have paved the way for placing a satellite in space in future
5091964 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5091965 this action and dual use possibilities for their ballistic missile program are inconsistent with their un security council obligations
5091966 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5091967 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5091968 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5091969 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5091970 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5091971 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5091972 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5091973 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5091974 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5091975 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5091976 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5091977 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5091978 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5091979 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5091980 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5091981 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5091982 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5091983 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5091984 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5091985 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5091986 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5091987 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5091988 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5091989 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5091990 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5091991 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5091992 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5091993 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5091994 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5091995 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
5091996 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5091997 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5091998 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5091999 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5092000 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5092001 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5092002 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5092003 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5092004 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5092005 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5092006 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5092007 people and news media tend to focus on what is considered to be controversial rather than focus on the issues that are relevant to a lot of the countries in the region
5092008 a singular focus is not good for anybody and certainly not good for the people that we are trying to be responsible for
5092009 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5092010 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5092011 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

5092018 the heads of the ruling coalition are expected to meet early next week to give a go ahead to their plan to impeach president pervez musharraf amid indications that efforts to persuade the president to resign have slackened due to his insistence to do so only after going through the charge sheet against him in addition to some political bigwigs mr musharraf has been conferring with constitutional experts like syed sharifuddin pirzada abdul hafeez pirzada and attorney general malik mohammad qayyum to explore legal possibilities like invoking article 58 2 b to dismiss the national assembly or approach the supreme court to challenge the charge sheet
5092019 i herniated a disc in my back three years ago and havent been the same since
5092020 as if that werent bad enough i also suffer from sleep apnea
5092021 he asked me what kind of pillow i was sleeping on i told him i wasnt sure what brand it was but it was soft and comfortable he told me to throw it away and start sleeping on a tri core cervical orthopedic pillow instead i did and have had tremendous results
5092022 the design also helps relieve spasms and alleviates minor tension since it re establishes the natural cervical curve of the neck while the person is at rest
5092023 even better than that it seems to have cured my sleep apnea as well
5092024 i cant tell you how good it feels to get a good nights sleep ive never felt better in my life

5092029 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5092030 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5092031 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5092032 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5092033 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5092034 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5092035 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5092036 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5092037 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

5092040 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5092041 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5092042 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5092043 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5092044 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5092045 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

5092079 precisely how this happens is one of the challenging questions in strongly correlated electron systems
5092080 but even though we dont know the precise mechanism we are still able to make some general predictions about the behavior of pnictides and weve suggested a number of experiments that can test these predictions

5092090 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5092091 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5092092 no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempt to legalize ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to its knees and undermine our democratic system

5092130 there is one simple step that would lift us out of recession so why is everyone too scared even to suggest it on the good ship ireland we are heading in economic terms into very stormy waters all the dials on the bridge are signalling danger there are alarms going off in every section and a warning is being bellowed over the intercom recession recession what can we do to steer us out of this growing storm there is one obvious solution which would allow us to lower interest rates boost our exports and help our industry but it is one which the commentariat are terrified of even raising that option is the withdrawal form the euro and yes this option may be difficult but it is not impossible and it has major benefits as it is high eurozone interest rates are hurting homeowners by pushing up mortgages and increasing inflation the latest interest rate rise alone puts in additional monthly burden of about 40 on a typical 250 000 mortgage over 30 years since the interest rates began rising from 2pc a hefty 360 every month has been lumbered on the average homeowners shoulders other things are going up as well an additional 19 000 people found themselves unemployed between may and june bringing the total signing on to 217 400 this is an increase of 55 000 in the past 12 months alone it may not be armageddon mr cowen but it is a terrifying meltdown so what in the face of all this does the european central bank do as always it focused on the french and german economies and put up euro interest rates a quarter point to 4 25pc the highest level in seven years just when we need a rate cut the ecb is yanking them up an absolute disaster even paul tansey economics editor of the resolutely pos eu irish times admits a further tightening of monetary policy is wholly inappropriate to current irish economic conditions but if it is so inappropriate what are we going to do about it how about we follow up on this knowledge to the next logical step to find a practical solution although it will make the resident euro federalists of the irish times faint one clear option that we have is to withdraw from the euro devalue our currency and set our own interest rates to suit ourselves there has never been a better time to do it in this post lisbon stasis a new opportunity presents itself it is no coincidence that in 1993 the year ireland devalued its currency by 10pc our economic growth rate after a long period of stagnation increased remarkably during this period a regime of lower personal and corporation taxation introduced by the government also encouraged inward investment by us multinationals and a sharp increase in exports the celtic tiger economy was thus born but irelands membership of the euro changed things dramatically for the worse the first consequence was the handing over control of interest rates to the european central bank in frankfurt which has a mandate to keep inflation around the 2pc mark and takes much greater cognisance of the larger states as a result of low euro interest rates ireland sloshed around in a sea of cheap credit which led to a building boom beyond compare cheap money led to an unsustainable boom but just as we needed higher interest rates to calm the economy down to a sustainable level the ecb cut rates to help the continental countries bust now follows boom cheap money led to an asset bubble showing that in monetary terms one size does not fit all the rise in ecb rates has led to the steep appreciation of the euro against the pound and dollar given that we do almost two thirds of our trade with these countries the euro has made our exports to our main markets uncompetitively expensive a gadget costing 1 made here in january 2002 would have cost an american consumer of business 0 88 today incredibly that same 1 gizmo would cost an american 1 56 is it any wonder that exports are nosediving most people quite rightly want free trade and good relations with their neighbouring european countries but that doesnt demand euro membership britain and denmark are members of the eu with full access to open markets yet have retained their own currencies of course there may be other ways to tackle this problem ray kinsella professor of banking and financial services at ucd is adamant that one size does not fit all and suggests two solutions one is that the ecbs mandate be changed to allow its members greater discretion in taking economic growth and unemployment into account instead of just keeping inflation below 2pc in a nutshell the ecb should move closer to the mandate of the us federal reserve a second option kinsella suggests is the setting up of a pan euro compensating mechanism to allow fiscal transfers when countries like ireland receive shocks thus helping to mitigate the effect of a centralised policy regime however i believe it is now opportune for us after planning and preparation to take more decisive action and take back our own national currency in order to fight the recession we need more control of our economy this move would entail a declaration and agreement with other eu states that ireland intends to leave the eurozone on a certain date our withdrawal would not mean either our abandonment of or expulsion from the eu today only 15 out of 27 eu states are in the eurozone sweden signed up to the euro with the maastricht treaty in 1993 but still hasnt introduced it it hasnt been penalised and what could the rest of the eu do anyway if we quit the euro invade ireland withdrawal from the euro would entail preparation and a time of transition to make contractual changes it is difficult but possible but it would not mean eu grants would stop or the common market would be shut to irish goods there has been a lot of talk post lisbon referendum about a two tier eu but there is already a multi tier eu as it is some countries in the eu are not in the euro some members are not in the schengen area which allows for free international movement without passports i would be very happy to be on tier two but with lower interest rates and an economy that actually works put simply euro interest rates have damaged our competitiveness at a time of growing global competition if we introduce our own currency we can devalue our currency to make our exports attractive again if we gradually move out of the euro we also bypass the eurozones growth and stability pact meaning the government will no longer be restrained by unnecessarily tight limits on borrowing huge powers were forfeited the day we signed up for the euro a decision exerted not by economic logic but by political pressure the czars of european integration saw the euro as a stepping stone to political union it is now time for ireland to reweigh the costs and benefits of the euro yes it is handy when travelling and increases price transparency however it has many more downsides yes government policy and the global credit crunch have had an effect on leading us to this point but we need to have a national debate about the detrimental effect of the euro on our economy and how were going to get out of this recession

5092156 they will also discover that their concern and their promises will sound empty to these people and will not be believed by them because little has ever happened to give them any hope at all

5092251 like many other democracies the us government is made up of two basic parts the elected constituency i e the various governors judges congressmen and the president and the unelected bureaucracies as represented by the numerous federal agencies
5092252 in a well balanced and correctly functioning democracy the elected part of the government is in charge of its unelected bureaucratic part giving the people a real voice in the agenda set by their government
5092253 while a significant part of the us government no doubt follows this democratic principle a considerable portion of the us government operates in complete secrecy and follows its own unaccountable agenda which unacknowledged very often is quite different from the public agenda

5092259 can evoke the feeling of a presence disorientation and perceptual irregularities it can activate images stored in the subjects memory including nightmares and monsters that are normally suppressed
5092260 on the possibility of directly accessing every human brain by electromagnetic induction of fundamental algorithms
5092261 contemporary neuroscience suggests the existence of fundamental algorithms by which all sensory transduction is translated into an intrinsic brain specific code direct stimulation of these codes within the human temporal or limbic cortices by applied electromagnetic patterns may require energy levels which are within the range of both geomagnetic activity and contemporary communication networks a process which is coupled to the narrow band of brain temperature could allow all normal human brains to be affected by a subharmonic whose frequency range at about 10 hz would only vary by 0 1 hz
5092262 within the last two decades a potential has emerged which was improbable but which is now marginally feasible
5092263 the historical emergence of such possibilities which have ranged from gunpowder to atomic fission have resulted in major changes in the social evolution that occurred inordinately quickly after the implementation reduction of the risk of the inappropriate application of these technologies requires the continued and open discussion of their realistic feasibility and implications within the scientific and public domain
5092264 a method for remote control of electrical stimulation of the nervous system
5092265 at a distance of one or more rooms and under conditions where the participant would not know or suspect that she would be experimented with one such experiment was carried out in a park at a distance
5092266 a post hypnotic mental suggestion to go to sleep was complied with within a minute
5092267 the controlled subjects would never be permitted to think as individuals a few months after birth a surgeon would equip each child with a socket mounted under the scalp and electrodes reaching selected areas of brain tissue perceptions and muscular activity could be either modified or completely controlled by bioelectric signals radiating from state controlled transmitters
5092268 a laboratory in which the issues of authority powerlessness individual motivation and behavior could be examined
5092269 a method to penetrate inside a mans mind and control his brain waves over long distance
5092270 kept probing for ways to control human behavior and they were doing so with space age technology that made the days of mkultra look like the horse and buggy era
5092271 they tried out their brainwashing techniques on the kids from mexico and south america they were considered expendable but on another echelon of the program they went after the best and the brightest american kids making perfect agents to combat the soviets wasnt i dont think their ultimate objective i cant remember what that was
5092272 well if they were choosing the best and brightest maybe they figured these kids would one day rise to important positions in the society and they wanted to gain long term control over them so they would be under their thumb so they could tap them at will a way of controlling the future society
5092273 the nazis gained control over the intelligentsia in germany that was a very key step in their dominance that was the first thing they did
5092274 this smells very much like a nazi program in the u s
5092275 i dont mean all the controllers were german but the style of it the insanity
5092276 they brought over a lot of nazi doctors after the war and not just to build rockets for a lot of projects
5092277 published articles in my files include descriptions of administration of 150 mcg of lsd to children age 5 10 years on a daily basis for days weeks months and in a few cases even years neurosurgeons at tulane yale and harvard did extensive research on brain electrode implants with intelligence funding and combined brain implants with large numbers of drugs including hallucinogens
5092278 dr greene used me in radiation experiments both for the purpose of determining the effects of radiation on various parts of my body and to terrorize me as an additional trauma in the mind control experiments she was eight years old
5092279 the rest of the experiments took place in tucson arizona out in the desert
5092280 dr greene moved on to wanting me to kill dolls that looked like real children i stabbed a doll with a spear once after being severely tortured but the next time i refused he used many techniques but as i got older i resisted more and more
5092281 he often tied me down in a cage which was near his office between 1972 and 1976 he and his assistants were sometimes careless and left the cage unlocked whenever physically possible i snuck into his office and found files with reports and memos addressed to cia and military personnel included in these files were project subproject subject and experiment names with some code numbers for radiation mind control experiments which i have submitted in my written documentation i was caught twice and dr greene tortured me ruthlessly with electric shock drugs spinning on a table putting shots in my stomach in my back dislocating my joints and hypnotic techniques to make me feel crazy and suicidal
5092282 dr robert heath of tulane university as early as 1955 working for the army gave patients lsd while he had electrodes implanted deep inside their brains
5092283 in the paul hoch m d a man who would become commissioner of mental hygiene for the state of new york then a laborer in the field for the cia gave a pseudoneurotic schizophrenic patient mescaline the patient had a not unfamiliar heaven and hell journey on the compound but hoch followed this up with a transorbital leucotomy hoch also gave a patient lsd and a local anesthetic and then proceeded to remove pieces of cerebral cortex asking at various moments whether the patients perceptions were changing
5092284 in 1958 i was to be tested they told me by some important doctors coming from a place called the society the human ecology society a cia front
5092285 the next year i was sent to a place in maryland called deep creek cabins to learn how to sexually please men also i was taught how to coerce them into talking about themselves it was richard helms deputy director of the cia dr gottlieb captain george white and morse allen who all planned on filming as many high government and agency officials and heads of academic institutions and foundations as possible i was to become a regular little spy for them after that summer eventually entrapping many unwitting men including themselves all with the use of a hidden camera i was only nine when this kind of sexual humiliation began
5092286 although the process of recalling these atrocities is certainly not an easy task nor is it without some danger to myself and my family i feel the risk is worth taking
5092287 to the best of my knowledge claudia has read nothing about mind control or cia covert operations since she decided to listen carefully and remember as much as she could about conversations among the researchers her memories are extraordinarily complete i have sent written copies of memories to dr alan scheflin author of the mind manipulators for validation and he has confirmed that she has knowledge of events and people that are not published anywhere that some of her memories contain new information and that some are already known and published some of her memories have been confirmed by family members she has also shown me old scrapbooks where she wrote notes to remember what was happening to her and hid the notes under pictures in the scrapbook

5092307 just prior to my arrival an east german graduate student was killed there while working on a project using a superconducting waveguide a cryogenically cooled device that aligns and aims radio waves with great precision what is surprising is what happened next the soviets had the entire wall of the physics lab ripped out and all the cryo equipment wave guides and other gear shipped to a castle near the czech ussr border
5092308 i learned from other professors who helped with the project that after a few months soviet scientists were able to kill goats at ranges beyond one kilometer and to cause disorientating or incapacitating effects depending on the aspect angle of the goats heads at well over two kilometres

5092335 people who have experienced migraines know just how debilitating these can be and people respond differently to different treatments
5092336 what we have seen is that topiramate can cut back the recurrence of migraines by about 45 on average
5092337 to a non migraine sufferer that may not seem a lot but these are people who can suffer migraines frequently and know just how severe it can be

5092356 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5092357 this action and dual use possibilities for their ballistic missile program are inconsistent with their un security council obligations

5092368 i dont know why obama chooses to insult a supreme court justice at a religious forum but his comments that justice thomas was not qualified to be on the court were revealing why would obama think given his own credentials that he was better qualified for president than clarence thomas was for the supreme court

5092370 in paperwork year after year dating back to 1998 the health districts own studies show the presence of mold in the building and the need for remediation
5092371 the regulations state that you will vacate the building remove all occupants and then relocate them to another building and that no one will go back in that building without a full respirator and a moon suit and it will be cleaned up according to epa standards

5092387 a loop in time is more than a science fiction novel meant to entertain young adults with its complicated yet intriguing storyline
5092388 much of the beauty and excitement portrayed is based on hard earth bound science but you are not reading science fiction anyone with a sense of wonder curiosity and imagination will be engaged by the weaving of the many literary vines
5092389 the writing is clear and elegant you could draw favorable comparisons between a loop in time and the harry potter series as well as madeleine lengles a wrinkle in time all of these books feature misunderstood talented youths and fanciful distortions of time and space more than anything however a loop in time reminds me of alice in wonderland which is high praise indeed

5092408 weve come on a small journey in the scale of things but a large journey for us of hope of optimism of reconciliation
5092409 the journey to build a better and fairer and more equitable society is a journey we must all continue on relentlessly and continue on together

5092416 voice broadcasting is really nothing all that new but when i saw what randal williams had designed in getting it in the hands of the average person huge increases in enrollments began almost immediately for the majority of users the scoreboard dont lie
5092417 randal and i have been partners on several projects and have shared ideas and strategies for three years now we could have gone into direct competition do a joint venture or simply partner up if me partnering with randal and the 500k power recruiter is a smart move for me then what should that be telling marketers coast to coast im thrilled and those who join us will be too
5092418 randal and i feel the same about how to treat and train those we work with the most frustrating aspect of our job responsibility is seeing folks become frustrated and fail this technology is state of the art combined with our professionalism and experience our guys are growing leaps and bounds predictably so

5092424 ten points is 10 points the beauty of it is keeping kyle from getting 10 points hes so fast you cant give him any room
5092425 what were doing here is a little bit of practicing for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car carl edwards did a great job the pit crew did a great job
5092426 it just came down to when he beat us off of pit road
5092427 that was it for us we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys we were good on that one run that one set of tires but that was pretty much what we had
5092428 we just didnt have enough for the no 99 there at the end we werent able to get through the corners as fast as carl was
5092429 carls right there he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5092430 we were a nine out of a 10 it seems like and those other guys were a 10 out of a 10
5092431 just to gamble a little bit on staying on track we knew at worst that we would still finish in the top five it was something to take a shot we certainly learned from it if we had to do it all over again wed probably still do it again

5092471 when you look at all of them cards they were probably deserved
5092472 every game is pretty tough you want everybody to be a little bit aggressive
5092473 overall we are very pleased i think once we get a few games under our belt i think we can get a bit more cohesion
5092474 obviously it was the first game so it was a little bit rusty at times
5092475 when you look at the 90 minutes we thoroughly deserved to win that
5092476 i walked in there and i fell it was dark and i didnt know when i was going to stop

5092480 i believe that the bible was sent not to teach me history but to teach me grace not to give me a system of philosophy but to give me a system of divinity not to teach worldly wisdom but spiritual wisdom hence i hold all preaching of philosophy and science in the pulpit to be altogether out of place i would check no mans liberty in this matter for god only is the judge of mans conscience but it is my firm opinion that if we profess to be christians we are bound to keep to christianity if we profess to be christian ministers we drivel away the sabbath day we mock our hearers we insult god if we deliver lectures upon botany or geology instead of delivering sermons on salvation he who does not always preach the gospel ought not to be accounted a true called minister of god
5092481 the dollars continuing uptrend is a key factor depressing commodities in general and triggering heavy sales in gold
5092482 inflation will restrict the feds ability to cut rates plus we have weaker growth in europe so the euro has been suffering
5092483 the dollar is coming out top at the moment so people have been liquidating commodities
5092484 not surprisingly the dollar is stronger and weighing on the commodity complex at large
5092485 with the rest of the world now joining the u s in slowing down the prospects for holding the dollar have brightened considerably
5092486 theres a perception that demand for commodities might be weakening
5092487 north america and western europe are struggling but the emerging economies remain strong
5092488 this little higher number is probably the result of lower gas prices the economy remains pretty weak and consumer sentiment reflects that
5092489 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since aug 7
5092490 failure to rapidly and completely implement the accord would have serious consequences on relations between russia and the european union
5092491 have to call an extraordinary meeting of the council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5092492 we will also have to determine if russias intervention against its georgian neighbor was a brutal and excessive response
5092493 the looming rate cut by the reserve bank will no doubt give companies greater optimism as they progress through 2009 mr james said in a note
5092494 the lower australian dollar and decline in fuel costs will arguably provide more benefits

5092500 the softening economic situation has led to a further slowdown in oil demand growth
5092501 oil demand growth will be on the decline in 2009 which will make the world demand growth the lowest since 2002
5092502 while oecd demand could still surprise us on the downside non oecd prospects particularly for china and the middle east gulf could be subject to upside adjustment

5092507 puedes elegir la que quieras no es como si nosotros quisieramos jugar
5092508 the financial market turmoil has meant that our funds rate reductions have led to less credit expansion to households and businesses than would typically be the case
5092509 the second half of 2008 will likely be extremely sluggish
5092510 well see some alleviation of the inflation pressures and having oil and other commodities come down so strongly helps
5092511 a young anarchic presence somebody who is genuinely threatening to the establishment
5092512 it was though theyd taken the joker and all the colors everything of it and just kind of put him through a turkish prison for a decade or so
5092513 its like hes gone through that personal hell to come out being this if you can even call him mad at the end here
5092514 what can you say weve been getting a lot of repeat business coming in
5092515 our audience is expanding like you would expect with terrific word of mouth and strong reviews our audience is getting a little bit older thats the good news were finding the younger demographic male and female coming back
5092516 to do 300 million plus in 10 days we just couldnt have predicted it
5092517 the titanic record has sat in a lock box for 10 years
5092518 the first weekend there was this huge pent up demand and eagerness by audiences to see this movie now its like a freight train it seems to be unstoppable
5092519 there are many important filmmakers who weve spoken with in the last couple of weeks about shooting with imax cameras
5092520 wed hoped to be in the mid to high 20 millions so to hit 30 million is a great start
5092521 having the chemistry of will ferrell and john c reilly together again reuniting with director adam mckay who did talladega nights its great they both immerse themselves and the humor comes from their connection
5092522 the hardcore x files fans theyre happy and frankly thats who the movie was made for

5092527 hes got a lot longer track record than the 2004 campaign against sen
5092528 hes a legendary entrepreneur and one of the things that i think we have to unify the country around is having an intelligent energy policy
5092529 everybody knows if we keep on going on the same track that were going and we are giving our wealth away were funding both sides of the war on terror obama said before meeting with pickens at the grand sierra resort in reno
5092530 president kennedy was pilloried by the super patriots as a no win chief the far right became a fount of proposals born of frustration and put forward in the name of anti communism active duty commanders played host to anti communist seminars on their bases and attended or addressed right wing meetings elsewhere
5092531 could think of manufacturing something that would be generally acceptable
5092532 should be favorably affected by developing the international image of the cuban government as rash and irresponsible and as an alarming and unpredictable threat to the peace of the western hemisphere
5092533 by manufacturing various pieces of evidence which would prove electronic interference on the part of the cubans
5092534 a series of well coordinated incidents to take place in and around
5092535 start riots near the main gate of the base others would pretend to be saboteurs inside the base ammunition would be blown up fires started aircraft sabotaged mortars fired at the base with damage to installations
5092536 we could blow up a u s ship in guantanamo bay and blame cuba
5092537 casualty lists in u s newspapers would cause a helpful wave of national indignation
5092538 we could develop a communist cuban terror campaign in the miami area in other florida cities and even in washington
5092539 the terror campaign could be pointed at cuban refugees seeking haven in the united states we could sink a boatload of cubans en route to florida real or simulated we could foster attempts on lives of cuban refugees in the united states even to the extent of wounding in instances to be widely publicized
5092540 create an incident which will demonstrate convincingly that a cuban aircraft has attacked and shot down a chartered civil airliner en route from the united states to jamaica guatemala panama or venezuela the destination would be chosen only to cause the flight plan route to cross cuba the passengers could be a group of college students off on a holiday or any grouping of persons with a common interest to support chartering a non scheduled flight
5092541 make it appear that communist cuban migs have destroyed a usaf aircraft over international waters in an unprovoked attack
5092542 that this responsibility for both oven and covert military operations be assigned to the joint chiefs of staff
5092543 the joint chiefs of staff believe that the cuban problem must be solved in the near future
5092544 further they see no prospect of early success in overthrowing the present communist regime either as a result of internal uprising or external political economic or psychological pressures accordingly they believe that military intervention by the united states will be required to overthrow the present communist regime
5092545 the joint chiefs of staff believe that the united states can undertake military intervention in cuba without risk of general war
5092546 they also believe that the intervention can be accomplished rapidly enough to minimize communist opportunities for solicitation of un action
5092547 t he joint chiefs of staff recommend that a national policy of early military intervention in cuba be adopted by the united states they also recommend that such intervention be undertaken as soon as possible and preferably before the release of national guard and reserve forces presently on active duty
5092548 i am the senior military my job to state what i believe and its his mcnamaras job to approve or disapprove
5092549 he gave general lemnitzer very short shrift and treated him like a schoolboy the general almost stood at attention when he came into the room everything was yes sir and no sir
5092550 we need a shake up of the joint chiefs of staff
5092551 we direly need a new chairman as well as new members
5092552 a contrived cuban attack on an oas organization of americas member could be set up
5092553 and the attacked state could be urged to take measures of self defense and request ice from the u s and oas the u s could almost certainly obtain necessary two thirds support among oas members for collective action against cuba
5092554 any of the contrived situations de above are inherently extremely risky in our democratic system in which security can be maintained after the fact with very great difficulty if the decision should be made to set up a contrived situation it be one in which participation by u s personnel is limited only to the most highly trusted covert personnel this suggests the infeasibility of the use of military units for any aspect of the contrived situation
5092555 the only area remaining for ration then would be to bribe one of castros subordinate commanders to initiate an attack on the u s naval base at guantanamo
5092556 a possible scenario whereby an attack on a united states reconnaissance aircraft could be exploited toward the end of effecting the removal of the castro regime
5092557 t he u s could undertake various measures designed to stimulate the cubans to provoke a new incident
5092558 flaunting our freedom of action hoping to stir the cuban military to action
5092559 depending above all on whether the cubans were or could be made to be trigger happy the development of the initial downing of a reconnaissance plane could lead at best to the elimination of castro perhaps to the removal of soviet troops and the installation of ground inspection in cuba or at the least to our demonstration of firmness on reconnaissance
5092560 we could blow up a u s ship in guantanamo bay and blame cuba casualty lists in u s newspapers cause a helpful wave of indignation
5092561 but it really didnt kind of get on the front burner until sometime within the last seven days
5092562 deadline must have been earlier than the decision than when we started to get serious about making the decision

5092567 when i wanted the corners i missed when i threw over the plate they hit it hard since i was a little kid ive wanted to pitch in this ballpark but it hasnt been kind to me this is not a game you want to go through it leaves a bitter taste
5092568 they got off to a three run lead and it was time for us to answer the call
5092569 if we dont get going maybe we dont win i think 3 4 5 in the lineup have to produce for us to win
5092570 you dont see it too often but its a fun game offensively it gives everyone a chance to contribute moose made some great pitches to get out of that second inning and we took it from there
5092571 finally a film that goes beyond green building to address the comprehensive benefits of green neighborhood design by prioritizing quality over size we can achieve better neighborhoods for people in all stages of life and income brackets the market for great neighborhoods will flourish once people know whats possible and can vote with their dollars developers governing officials and the public need to see this film
5092572 people dont really understand there are choices about how you build and where you live says wann this story enables them to see an example of something different to make them happier save them money and save the environment its a lay persons look at what green building means higher density a community garden walkable and interconnected streets nearby shops and even shared car rentals encourage a sociable existence
5092573 bring out the love part that was almost non existent in the first stage
5092574 but it really didnt kind of get on the front burner until sometime within the last seven days
5092575 deadline must have been earlier than the decision than when we started to get serious about making the decision

5092609 they are persons of interest who were seen near the fire in a vehicle like this
5092610 theres no lightning so we can rule that one out
5092611 it shows great disrespect for nature that someone would start a fire
5092612 we swore if they go ahead with the execution we will exact vengeance from anyone who performs it
5092613 to which restaurant can i take a teenage girl in paris
5092614 if robots ever get too smart hell know how to stop them
5092615 a robot may not injure a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm
5092616 this is too complex for me to figure out so it must be beyond human understanding and beyond natural origins
5092617 the literary darwinists magazine 11 6 05 loses track or this
5092618 evolutionary psychology has replaced freud who upon discovering that a remote tribe had an incest taboo would ascribe it to an unconscious repression on the part of the sons of their sexual attraction to their mothers instead we would likely cite an evolutionary biology principle that states that we have involved an innate repulsion to inbreeding because it creates birth defects and birth defects are a barrier to survival
5092619 if natural phenomena show complexity that is at this point irreducible acknowledging there might be a creator seems to be the intelligent approach
5092620 life forms that appear to be irreducibly complex where natural selection will not preserve functional intermediates
5092621 there really arent any words to describe it it has been a gift of a year of all the years this has been the most dominant weve ever been its just an awesome car
5092622 its like a little league pitcher thats just a huge fan of the sport and they bring up mickey mantle to play ball with you frank has meant so much to the sport and having him back in the sport is only going to make it better
5092623 we got over the transmission problems that we had saturday and we really got it done today
5092624 for me it confirms to all these doubters that i am fit enough to do this
5092625 the head is more important that the body and this becomes more valuable as we get older
5092626 to have a person think in a free manner and then figure out what that is were years away from that
5092627 this will never be used in a way without somebodys real active cooperation
5092628 we write about whats relevant in our lives at the time we want to put out the message that life has highs and lows but we are making the most of them and getting through them with the help of our music
5092629 the best way seems to be keeping close to your fans and building them through blogs live shows and media
5092630 a wop bop a lu bop a wop bam boom
5092631 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
5092632 well they are here tell me about it when linux can do it too
5092633 they dont need all those other rw functions or dvd ram anyway
5092634 oh look our little linux johnny is the only one marching in step
5092635 its a classic case of rage of hate for someone its very personal
5092636 around november or december 2007 a man came into the office he was crying and his arms were bruised seeking assistance
5092637 took him into her office then to my amazement i heard her tell him that another way doesnt provide services or assistance for men my heart went out to this man because it was evident that he was truly a victim of domestic violence
5092638 this is discrimination and violating mens rights there are men with children that are being victimized it takes courage for men to come forward and admit they are victims then when they do we revictimize them all over again
5092639 we have limited resources and its all we can do to try and keep up with the demand for services for women and children
5092640 in all of that time there was one woman admitted who i was sure had been severely physically abused the rest of the women and kids who came and went were playing the system to the hilt
5092641 o fuckin what its an island dude its a fucking island
5092642 j there comes a time when every one needs to abuse perscription drugs and this is one of those times
5092643 youre going to do whatever you want to me right
5092644 no you people are too stupid youre just country hicks you dont know what youre doing
5092645 ent o eu olhei e vejam uma tempestade de vento estava vindo do norte uma grande nuvem e um fogo ardente e um brilho reluzente nog circundando a

5092648 now he has said that russian forces will withdraw and withdraw to their pre august 6 7 lines
5092649 this time i hope he means it you know the word of the russian president needs to be upheld by his forces people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
5092650 this must cover all russian forces that have entered georgia since aug 7
5092651 if this clause of the ceasefire accord is not applied rapidly and totally i would summon an extraordinary european council to decide what consequences to draw
5092652 while the buildings did not appear to be very damaged there are clear signs of massive looting of both shops and private accommodations
5092653 several studies show sleep problems may precede post traumatic stress disorder and depression
5092654 our hope is that by treating sleep problems right away we may potentially prevent problems like depression and ptsd down the line
5092655 when military personnel return home sleep issues can contribute to substance abuse depression and ptsd veterans often report experiencing cold sweats during sleep jumpiness when trying to fall asleep fighting out dreams and even sleeping with a gun near the bed to calm their state of mind
5092656 research and medical care and training are key mission components of the va system va hospitals are affiliated with universities in their communities to collaborate on research that will enhance the quality of life of veterans spouses survivors and dependents
5092657 there may be sleep apnea issues breathing disorders brain injuries neurological problems or medications that are complicated the insomnia that need to be considered
5092658 research studies show that behavioral treatments for insomnia work just as well as medications in the short term and better than medications in the long term over time sedative medications often stop having the same effects than when you first started taking them our goal is to learn how to modify these behavioral therapies to address unique issues that military personnel face with their sleep
5092659 we have been expanding our mental health programs over the last three years in order to meet their needs
5092660 forty five new positions in mental health care have been added new programs created and existing programs expanded for the reintegration and care of these returning soldiers
5092661 again no disrespect to gov kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done
5092662 maybe karl roves and the republicans dont care about business climate that would explain why were in the situation that were in
5092663 governing magazine was also named virginia as the top governed state in america
5092664 maybe to karl rove that isnt an achievement that would explain a federal government that couldnt respond to a hurricane a katrina and couldnt figure out how to start and manage a war
5092665 im a loser baby so why dont you kill me
5092666 no penile mutilation in my threads the penis is an object of worship not sacrifice
5092667 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5092668 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5092669 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5092670 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5092671 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5092672 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5092673 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5092674 wie die schwarze musik den wei en pop pr gte
5092675 en esto queremos ser muy prudentes no hemos sido victima de ninguna amenaza
5092676 en el parqueadero un vigilante no dejaba salir a ning n carro argumentaba que ten a orden de no hacerlo un se or alto le dijo que si no lo dejaba pasar lo iba a golpear
5092677 me parece que la emergencia estuvo muy mal manejada por parte de carrefour cuando se iniciaron algunos incendios por el altavoz dijeron que era un simple corto y que estaba superado a los 10 minutos se escuch una fuerte explosi n que produjo un caos enorme
5092678 cuando supimos que se trataba de un atentado abrimos todas las puertas
5092679 a los 20 minutos se escuch una fuerte explosi n cerca a la zona de licores
5092680 hegemonialen einfluss ber die baltischen staaten und osteuropa gewinnen au erdem ber die ukraine georgien moldawien und ber all jene staaten die russland als sein nahes ausland bezeichnet
5092681 das eigentliche ziel ist die finnlandisierung georgiens die absetzung des amtierenden pr sidenten und seine ersetzung durch eine russische marionette die finnlandisierung werde russland die kontrolle ber die baku ceyhan pipline geben
5092682 das ist nicht wie 1968 bei der invasion der tschechoslowakei als russland seine nachbarn bedrohen eine hauptstadt besetzen eine regierung st rzen konnte und damit davonkam die dinge haben sich ge ndert
5092683 russland ist zwar aggressiv china despotisch und iran messianisch aber keiner von den dreien ist so gef hrlich wie die totalit ren staaten des 20 jahrhunderts

5092685 die bush administration hat saakaschwili vielleicht nicht zum angriff auf die russen ermutigt sie hat aber auch nicht gen gend getan um ihn davon abzuhalten
5092686 zur schaffung eines georgischen pr sidenten bei dem die reiterhosen daf r viel zu gro waren
5092687 auf die westliche rhetorik ber demokratie und freiheit gebaut nun unter feindlichem beschuss m ssen wir fragen wenn der westen nicht mit uns ist wer ist dann mit uns wird die rote linie nicht jetzt gezogen wann wird sie dann gezogen georgien kann und darf nicht das erste opfer einer neuen weltordnung nach moskaus vorstellungen werden

5092691 die heftigste reaktion auf den russischen milit reinsatz in georgien
5092692 die verhandlungen zwischen warschau und washington waren lang und schwer beide seiten haben viele fehler gemacht aber das ergebnis ist nicht schlecht vor allem jetzt in so unsicheren zeiten
5092693 soll doch dieser abschluss ein erfolg f r die regierung sein
5092694 ich denke dass die ereignisse in georgien aber auch die geschehnisse wenige tage vor dem krieg in georgien die regierung erkennen lie en dass schwarz schwarz und wei wei ist
5092695 wie es scheint haben die amerikaner vor allem wegen der situation im kaukasus ihre meinung ge ndert aus der sicht washingtons hat dieser konflikt bewiesen dass russland kein zuverl ssiger partner f r die vereinigten staaten ist und seine nachbarn weiterhin in seinen einflussbereich z hlt
5092696 die letzten tage haben erneut bewiesen wie wichtig die nationale sicherheit ist dass die unabh ngigkeit welche wir vor nicht ganz 20 jahren erk mpft haben nicht f r die ewigkeit gegeben worden ist mann muss sie achten man muss um sie k mpfen

5092739 that was one incident where he thought i had undercut him i had a completely different view of it
5092740 when colleagues disagree on an issue the notion that its cause for attack is mistaken i felt very strongly that the guest worker program was not in the best interests of the country i voted against it he voted for it i respect senator mccains right to take positions different than mine what i dont do is abuse his integrity for doing so
5092741 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because that what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama

5092806 we are especially pleased by our athletes in judo shooting and weightlifting but every single medal is meaningful in its own way and won through painstaking efforts by our athletes
5092807 generally speaking chinese athletes are not strong contenders in many events in the second half of the games
5092808 with events like track and field chinas pace in winning gold medals will slow down

5092817 but the smooth material apparently spewed out by the geyser makes a very attractive target for future spacecraft observations

5092838 when i hear obama i think yeah mccain comes across as a grouchy old man but the contrast on the issues eventually becomes clear
5092839 but mccain was clear on issues like life he said life begins at conception thats my position he believes what i believe i like obama but ill be voting for mccain
5092840 weve had a republican and i have moments when i approve and moments when i dont approve
5092841 the more conservative element of the christian population is slowly coming to grips with what an obama presidency might be like
5092842 as the finer points of a wide range of issues are clarified by each nominee the initial excitement about senatot obama has lost some luster if senator mccain converts such apprehensions into votes this will be a closer race than many have anticipated
5092843 we won 4 0 but more important the chelsea fans saw a beautiful game we have to keep this going and we can every game every week
5092844 we played more aggressive than last season and portsmouth were surprised with our team this is a chelsea performance but well need more quality in the future
5092845 weve worked on various tactics pre season and the first half was the best football we can play
5092846 having not won anything last year i think weve gone into the season with a new determination
5092847 i think the owner is happy like the other fans
5092848 it was a different experience for me to what ive lived until now i only give the players the freedom to play and allow them to express their style lampard is not brazilian hes english but he touched the ball very well the same with michael ballack
5092849 the full backs jose bosingwa and ashley cole are good when they go forward they cross very well dribble very well we played as a team
5092850 for the jewish people jerusalem is not a city containing holy places or commemorating holy events the city as such is holy and has for at least two and a half millennia served as the symbol of the historic existence of a people hunted humiliated massacred but never despairing of the promise of its ultimate restoration jerusalem and zion have become the local habitation and the name for the hope and meaning of jewish existence and of its continuity
5092851 in the meantime it turns out that one of the two presidential candidates who visited israel sent emissaries and special messages to president al assad in damascus and abu mazen abbas in ramallah with an interesting message continue the negotiations with israel any progress is welcome i want to jump into the conflict immediately upon my entry onto the position and the more advanced the negotiations are the better

5092858 food is not just sustenance but comfort companionship and communication it is both a connection with our most elemental animal selves and with the physical world outside of us that supplies our needs in that connection and in the plain physiological reality of eating there is a joy that can be transcendent if we let it be the truth and logic of this fact have become so lost recently that oddly weve turned the idea around were more likely to think that in being stingy with how we feed ourselves lies our salvation
5092859 dietary restraint holding back on either the amount or the types of food we eat for external reasons has become so pervasive that people see restricting their food intake as normal and its applauded by the dietary powers that be its become completely accepted that eating for emotional reasons is bad that one should simply put fuel in ones body as if it were a car

5092880 this is unbelievable were winning races were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5092881 ten points is 10 points the beauty of it is keeping kyle from getting 10 points hes so fast you cant give him any room
5092882 what were doing here is a little bit of practicing for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car carl edwards did a great job the pit crew did a great job
5092883 it just came down to when he beat us off of pit road
5092884 that was it for us we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys we were good on that one run that one set of tires but that was pretty much what we had
5092885 we just didnt have enough for the no 99 there at the end we werent able to get through the corners as fast as carl was
5092886 carls right there he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5092887 we were a nine out of a 10 it seems like and those other guys were a 10 out of a 10
5092888 just to gamble a little bit on staying on track we knew at worst that we would still finish in the top five it was something to take a shot we certainly learned from it if we had to do it all over again wed probably still do it again

5092890 were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5092891 the greatest part is we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle
5092892 hes just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us thats what we have to keep doing is to try and win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground
5092893 he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5092894 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5092895 what were doing here is a little bit of practicing for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car carl edwards did a great job the pit crew did a great job

5092902 he often gave speeches led board meetings and had conversations in his sleep
5092903 sometimes this trait got him in trouble but mostly it allowed him to speak first
5092904 how could one man love this many people and make each think they were the most important person in the world
5092905 marvin squinted those steely blue eyes and looked right through me he pursed his lips and said i only want one thing i want the best education this state can give to every child and thats the only thing ill ever want
5092906 he had the passion of a revolutionary the instincts of a street fighter the mind of an investment banker and the soul of a saint most important marvin had the heart of a lion
5092907 in the last days of his life when his heart was only working at 25 percent capacity it was still bigger than all of our hearts together
5092908 in everything he did he thought it was important to be the aggressor set the agenda
5092909 there is no iowan who has contributed more to education than marvin pomerantz
5092910 part of it was his religion he didnt wear it on his shoulder and he didnt impose it on others
5092911 la organizaci n mundial del comercio el banco mundial el fondo monetario internacional y la mayor a de los gobiernos han implantado un tipo de industrializaci n de la agricultura con la liberalizaci n de los mercados que se rigen por la competici n y por la especulaci n que han acabado por afectar a la soberan a alimentaria de la mayor a de los pa ses del mundo

5092915 this habit of picking and choosing winds up expending a lot of energy because your mind is constantly vigilant constantly watching out to make sure that hurt disappointment loneliness and a great many other painful experiences dont happen again what room is left for silence
5092916 when youre not distracted by self image you can only be in the state of innocence
5092917 the secret to seeing innocently is seeing from a new viewpoint one that is not conditioned by what you expect to see
5092918 the body is just a place your memories call home
5092919 the wizard inside each of us could also be called the witness the role of the witness is not to interfere in the changing world but to see and understand the witness doesnt rest it remains awake even when you are dreaming or in a dreamless sleep it therefore does not need to see through your eyes
5092920 who am i is the only question worth asking and the only one never answered it is your destiny to play an infinity of roles but these roles are not yourself the spirit is nonlocal but it leaves behind a fingerprint which we call the body a wizard does not believe himself to be a local event dreaming of a larger world a wizard is a world dreaming of local events
5092921 because it is completely relative your viewpoint cannot be called real reality doesnt depend on a viewpoint it simply is and most of us dwelling as we do inside our private worlds do not contact the real very often the unreal is the habitat of the senses the real is the habitat of the wizard you have to look behind the curtain of memory to begin to discover the true fabric of reality
5092922 mortals believe that they are physical machines that learned to think actually they are thoughts that learned to create a physical machines
5092923 if your true source is in the subtle unseen world rather than in the physical then your body isnt really made up of cells these are not the building blocks of life nor are the atoms and molecules that cells can be broken down into the body is built on invisible abstractions called information and energy both of which are contained in your dna
5092924 hmmmm i wonder if you cut the minutes down if the phone actually stops working when they reach the limit or if you will now be charged overages if they go over 150 hmmmm

5092927 theyd say the investors no one will ever have a tv and a computer in the same room
5092928 another example of this is the word ringtones it is worth millions right now but five years ago it wasnt worth 50 bucks if you see a trend or something that you see coming out that the next guy doesnt spend ten bucks and buy up that name
5092929 if you ask 10 different experts they are sure to tell you 10 different things about domains value
5092930 we got something for 150 000 if they had wanted 5 million i would have done it in a blink of an eye

5092945 this ministry has been the phoenix in my own personal life
5092946 through all those 18 surgeries and the years that went by getting through them my constant prayer was god just show me what i can do in the physical condition im in to serve you and help people
5092947 for two months i had this conversation with god i said excuse me but this isnt a safe neighborhood cant you send a big male christian down the street instead of me i kept bringing that to gods attention by his grace he ignored me
5092948 our parents couldnt help us and they were really happy that we were in a country where people help when there is a need
5092949 its a great way for middle and upper class people to recycle furniture we are able to give them a tax write off

5092959 i dont think wales won any golds in athens so its brilliant to represent my home nation here and make it a second welsh gold after nicoles brilliant ride
5092960 im so proud of what the welsh rugby team have done nicole did fantastically in the cycling and weve still got tom lucy to come in the rowing tomorrow and geraint thomas in the velodrome
5092961 its great to be flying the welsh flag on the world stage my dads born and bred in wrexham and is welsh through and through and so am i
5092962 i will answer the question i looked the man in the eye i found him to be very straightforward and trustworthy we had a very good dialogue i was able to get a sense of his soul a man deeply committed to his country and the best interests of his country and i appreciated so very much the frank dialogue
5092963 no one is perfect god is a loving merciful compassionate and forgiving god
5092964 his mercy extends to those who fear him from generation to generation
5092965 command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth which is so uncertain but to put their hope in god command them to do good to be rich in good deeds and to be generous and willing to share
5092966 all these i have kept the young man said what do i still lack jesus answered if you want to be perfect go sell your possessions and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven then come follow me
5092967 what must i do to inherit eternal life he answered love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind and love your neighbor as yourself you have answered correctly jesus replied do this and you will live
5092968 what is highly value among men is detestable in god s sight
5092969 we are witnesses of these things and so is the holy spirit whom god has given to those who obey him
5092970 and if anyone does not have the spirit of christ he does not belong to christ
5092971 but you were washed you were sanctified made holy you were justified made free of all sins in the name of our lord jesus christ and by the spirit of our god
5092972 make every effort to enter through the narrow door because many i tell you will try to enter and will not be able to
5092973 no one who lives in him keeps on sinning no one who continues to sin has either seen him or known him
5092974 the reason the son of god came was to destroy the devil s work no one who is born of god will continue to sin because god s seed the holy spirit remains in him he cannot go on sinning because he has been born of god

5093070 external pressures climaxing in a national hysteria that tainted the tenure process
5093071 although depauls decision to deny me tenure was a bitter blow i would be remiss in my responsibilities if i did not also acknowledge depauls honorable role of providing a scholarly haven for me the past six years it is a fact and i would want to acknowledge it that the depaul administration kept me on its faculty despite overwhelming external pressures it is also a fact that my professional colleagues displayed rare rectitude in steadfastly supporting me it is also a fact that depaul students rose to dazzling spiritual heights in my defense that should be the envy of and an example for every university in the united states i will miss them
5093072 professor finkelstein has expressed the view that he should have been granted tenure and that third parties external to the university influenced depaul in denying tenure that is not so over the past several months there has been considerable outside interest about the tenure decision this attention was unwelcome and inappropriate in the end however it had absolutely no impact on either the process or the final outcome
5093073 i have considered the fact that reviewers at all levels both for and against tenure commented upon your ad hominem attacks on scholars with whom you disagree in the opinion of those opposing tenure your unprofessional personal attacks divert the conversation away from consideration of ideas and polarize and simplify conversations that deserve layered and subtle consideration as such they believe your work not only shifts toward advocacy and away from scholarship but also fails to meet the most basic standards governing scholarship discourse within the academic community
5093074 we are disappointed that professor finkelstein has resigned many students will miss him
5093075 i will return to my office i will teach my classes
5093076 when a faculty member reaches an agreement with the institution that brings the matter to an end
5093077 open and fair procedures for questioning controversial decisions are important
5093078 it is really unfortunate that depaul came to the public eye in this way but i think that the issues that were raised are extremely valuable and valid and going to be considered
5093079 i hope we can turn it to the benefit of the faculty and the benefit of the continuing integrity of our tenure and promotion and peer review process

5093084 by capitulating to the threats antics and pressures of alan dershowitz the israel lobby and its numerous affiliates depaul has compromised something so integral to an educational institutions mission that once so compromised it is impossible to regain
5093085 depaul university is more vulnerable than ever to the next assault upon its integrity and autonomy no matter how many millions of dollars have poured into its coffers because of the finkelstein tenure denial we are vulnerable
5093086 will those faculty associated with and standing in support of finkelstein be the next targets of depauls administration if so i would certainly be a likely target

5093101 our success educationally industrially and politically is based upon the protection of a nation founded by ourselves and the nation can be nowhere else but in africa
5093102 most other olympics acquired their label during or after the games usually after emotions had coalesced or a big news event pushed other stories off the front page but the combination of fascination with china and increasingly intense churn of media attention has changed that

5093106 four out of seven toilets were not flushing so for the comfort of our passengers we diverted to adelaide
5093107 the filming of this it was such a unique experience for all of us because there was nothing conventional about how we shot it
5093108 it was shot as a reality show our pov was our cameras every take that we did was a one er one fluid take nine cameras running at all times so it was a live set
5093109 cause you have the structure of the script but then they would just give us scenarios and stuff and we would just riff
5093110 phil sgriccia the director he basically snuck that in there
5093111 and because an episode had never been filmed like this before
5093112 the network and everyone was like kind of nervous going into it at first
5093113 at first and then when they first started seeing the dailies and on top of that our days usually youre on set at six in the morning until ten o clock at night its a long day we were finishing our days by the afternoon
5093114 it was just rolling cameras all the time so everyone was just were done then that opened up to the confessionals and writing more things and ideas and really there was so much freedom and growth
5093115 wed go home and im not even kidding our stomachs our face muscles would be sore cause youd try to keep your face stiff trying not to laugh during a take and it just you know
5093116 there were so many takes during the filming he actually walked off the set and laid on the ground outside and started laughing
5093117 hes so big he literally picked me and travis up one day he was like come on little buddies
5093118 so at the end of the day wed be piling in the van and getting driven off by transpo and wed just be chatting like ive never had this experience on a set before
5093119 you know usually at the end of the day youre just tired sigh but we were just chatting like we were in 5 th grade
5093120 it was always a great honor to come back on the show
5093121 eric kripke said before the episode even came out one of two things is going to happen people are either going to love it or they are going to hate it
5093122 and some people hated it give me sam and dean
5093123 oh yeah but we just had so much fun shooting it and the fan response was so wonderful
5093124 and open to it was really cool too because we were acting like ahh you just never know but theyre such great guys
5093125 an incredibly rewarding experience it was a completely new way to approach the craft a completely new way to approach the means of production and i loved it and i would absolutely be interested in doing that again
5093126 it was a great between the four of us and with the guys as well it was really like a dream theyre so much fun
5093127 they were a dream so yeah it was really gratifying to have gotten that feedback we like that
5093128 do you think i have a problem dismissing a cabinet minister
5093129 how am i supposed to know and identify everybodys friends family and relatives
5093130 besides it is not me who is doing it but people at the ministry
5093131 there is such a concentration of people who are close to smer at all the levels of the approval process that it gives serious reason to suspect cronyism
5093132 there is the suspicion that it is precisely their relationship with smer that could have given these people an advantage during the approval process
5093133 this case gives the signal that as part of a single call for projects people who are close to smer can draw huge amounts of money and gain advantages mainly information through their contacts
5093134 the players should be made responsible for not warning about the possibility of conflicts of interests and also for not having created rules strict enough to prevent such conflicts
5093135 take the european socialists for example they speak nobly and are always dressed decently and smartly but what about the policy they push it is far from socialist

5093139 and its not as if the republicans at cso are the only ones making sure its a successful event
5093140 threatening telephone calls cold shoulders nasty letters and destruction of property
5093141 i have received an eyewitness account that my sign that had been placed in the vicinity of one of the tee stations close to the clubhouse was taken out of the ground destroyed and thrown in the trash can by our partys appointed fall campaign liaison
5093142 all party resources including the resources of affiliated clubs such as womens democrat and rooster booster
5093143 my reluctance to entrust my election to the efforts of the central committee should not come as a surprise since the partys vice chairman allie craycraft jr was allowed to vigorously campaign against me during the primary
5093144 additionally during a june 5 phone conversation with the partys fall campaign liaison i informed him of my intent to control my own campaign he responded with a threat of retaliation and defeat in the future should i prevail in the november election
5093145 its happened before and im sure it could happen again
5093146 on primary election night tom and i went to democratic headquarters after winning
5093147 we were shunned by party leadership allie walked away from tom and didnt say anything to me i was within four or five feet of him
5093148 after that i expected some conciliatory action a call or coming over to congratulate me but that did not happen i even went to the first candidates meeting but i could tell from the attitude of marge she was not conciliatory at all i decided i didnt want to be part of that whole atmosphere thats when i decided i better just run my own campaign
5093149 i am rather disappointed but not surprised at your decision to deny me and my campaign the opportunity to use democrat headquarters for a fundraising luncheon
5093150 evidently you subscribe to the notion that the party chairperson can dictate who is to be supported and who can use the partys headquarters
5093151 and people are being re directed to your candidate of choice
5093152 it is indeed a shame that you have taken this position because it has caused serious damage to the entire party
5093153 you have talked about party unity in the past but events in this primary election clearly indicate that party unity only means loyalty to the central committee and nothing else
5093154 they decided a long time ago to do whatever it took to get me out of office because i wouldnt kowtow to them you have a small group of people trying to dictate policy and who we elected officeholders employ who we appoint in government
5093155 i dont want to start a controversy about being a dissident or anything like that im just trying to run for judge
5093156 i want to make it really clear that i am supporting the democratic ticket i just have a problem with relying on the current leadership to work in my best interest
5093157 paying an assessment slating fee or other mandatory political payment to a political organization
5093158 as your party chairman and as your friend i am asking you to join with the rest of us and let us all move together on to a successful november election
5093159 i really want to see you win and i want to be in a position to do everything i can to help make that happen
5093160 the delaware county democratic party has a long and somewhat notorious history of factionalism some of it caused by this pay to play attitude party politics always involves factions but in most cases successful party officials usually see a responsibility to unify the party rather than excommunicate their own nominees
5093161 when will this petty mindedness affect the campaigns of democratic state sen sue errington and democratic state rep dennis tyler what goes around comes around
5093162 its too painful wasting time energies and efforts to be involved with any activity emerging from democratic party headquarters
5093163 petty mindedness damages good candidates and is very destructive of individual personas and the community
5093164 i cant believe you told me to stuff it today in front of the whole bloody squad
5093165 like youd do anything about it besides i dont give a damn about auror protocol you of all people should know that by now

5093167 and by the way its getting late youd best get dressed and get back home to your wife dont you think
5093168 you know that i hate it when you say that right i told you along time ago when we started seeing each other that love had no place in this
5093169 i would leave dorian in a heartbeat if youd just say it back to me once just once
5093170 you know thats never going to happen i told you when we got together i wasnt interested in the happily ever after bullshit i like things how the way they are and i dont need anymore complications in my bollixed life
5093171 if youre looking for the firewhiskey youre not going to find it in there hermione

5093180 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5093181 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5093182 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5093183 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5093184 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5093189 that my family didnt surrender in 1865 and i havent surrendered

5093191 it takes a true person of character to stand up and defend unpopular individuals
5093192 that confederate southern americans are no longer going to take the back seat of the bus
5093193 a lot of people have asked southerners why do you keep fighting the war
5093194 because a lot of people havent stopped attacking us thats why were tired of being second class citizens and the stereotype for our good friends in hollywood and the media and were tired of being the whipping boy for the race problems in this country

5093238 you dont need a perfect credit score but its important that you dont have personal bankruptcies and chargeoffs

5093240 the value of our dollar today would have been about 20 cents had we not taken the steps and the measures that we took
5093241 so those who talk about the economy not doing well under the interim administration dont know what they talking about
5093242 we look at the indicators and you find out so an objective assessment will show you that the economy was on the verge of collapse under qarase
5093243 i think we delight to praise what we enjoy because the praise not merely expresses but completes the enjoyment it is its appointed consummation it is not out of compliment that lovers keep on telling one another how beautiful they are the delight is incomplete till it is expressed it is frustrating to have discovered a new author and not to be able to tell anyone how good he is to come suddenly at the turn of the road upon some mountain valley of unexpected grandeur and then to have to keep silent because the people with you care for it no more than for a tin can in a ditch to hear a good joke and find no one to share it with
5093244 but how if one could really and fully praise even such things to perfection utterly get out in poetry or music or paint the upsurge of appreciation which almost bursts you if it were possible for a created soul fully i mean up to the full measure conceivable in a finite being to appreciate that is to love and delight in the worthiest object of all and simultaneously at every moment to give this delight perfect expression then that soul would be in supreme beautitude it is along these lines that i find it easiest to understand the christian doctrine that heaven is a state in which angels now and men hereafter are perpetually employed in praising god fully to enjoy is to glorify
5093245 art acts above all on the soul shaping its spiritual structure an artist who has no faith is like a painter who was born blind the allotted function of art is not as is often assumed to put across ideas to propagate thoughts to serve as example the aim of art is to prepare a person for death to plough and harrow his soul rendering it capable of turning to good

5093251 then i saw an angel coming down from heaven holding in his hand the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain and he seized the dragon that ancient serpent who is the devil and satan and bound him for a thousand years and threw him into the pit and shut it and sealed it over him so that he might not deceive the nations any longer until the thousand years were ended after that he must be released for a little while and when the thousand years are ended satan will be released from his prison and will come out to deceive the nations that are at the four corners of the earth gog and magog to gather them for battle their number is like the sand of the sea a nd the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet were and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever
5093252 athletics is what i want to do its in my heart

5093296 around november or december 2007 a man came into the office he was crying and his arms were bruised seeking assistance
5093297 took him into her office then to my amazement i heard her tell him that another way doesnt provide services or assistance for men my heart went out to this man because it was evident that he was truly a victim of domestic violence
5093298 this is discrimination and violating mens rights there are men with children that are being victimized it takes courage for men to come forward and admit they are victims then when they do we revictimize them all over again
5093299 we have limited resources and its all we can do to try and keep up with the demand for services for women and children
5093300 in all of that time there was one woman admitted who i was sure had been severely physically abused the rest of the women and kids who came and went were playing the system to the hilt

5093380 china has every reason to feel proud of and pleased with its remarkable achievements made in its family planning policy the country could offer its experiences and special expertise to help other countries

5093397 we wanted to play better as we moved into the medal round
5093398 as a team 1 through 12 we did a good job we lost focus at times but were playing well
5093399 preliminary play was a good warmup for the challenge we have ahead
5093400 we saw a lot of different styles of basketball so that will prepare us
5093401 toutes les paroles de ma bouche sont justes elles nont rien de faux ni de d tourn toutes sont claires pour celui qui est intelligent et droites pour ceux qui ont trouv la science
5093402 it was targeted to a specific audience for specific reasons
5093403 we accomplished that mission and it will continue in another medium
5093404 weve seen a dramatic increase in the number of people reading despite what all of the numbers and that seem to say
5093405 everyone thinks the internet has been the death of the public libraries and exactly the opposite is true we see more and more and more readership every year
5093406 the club will meet weekly to read together and solve a mystery
5093407 the hope is that it will inspire children to read for enjoyment which will ultimately build their reading skills
5093408 i was amazed by the sheer breadth and quality of crime fiction thats out there and i think much of the best writing today is done in the genre
5093409 in all likelihood this issue will escalate and i understand could result in wto action focused specifically on how the u s government enforces its laws i cannot see how that can be in the interests of this country

5093418 the united states does it again another blow out victory
5093419 this makes 30 straight victories in olympic play for the united states women
5093420 so many top players came to this years olympics honestly to win a gold medal to have a gold medal around your neck or any medal for that matter and to have an opportunity to play for your country its really second to none
5093421 we had to work for it when people play for their country they play so much better it seems youre up against how good they are and also pride for their country it is something different about the competition here
5093422 it was tough when i touched that wall and saw that
5093423 im hoping that i rewrote the rules for anyone who wants to do something and they think theyre too old to do it
5093424 whenever the american women take the court its never boring you dont know what youre going to get youre going to get some brilliance youre going to get some plays that make you scratch your head
5093425 you know there was a time sports and it wasnt really all that long ago if you said the name michael no last name only michael there was absolutely no doubt who you were talking about
5093426 we are now far beyond the need for swimming expertise to understand that michael phelps is truly something special but is it possible despite this mind numbing uninterrupted parade of success that we may have actually underestimated his accomplishments phelps did the hardest thing of all to do in sports he won when he was expected to that not any opponent bred pressure that perhaps no one has ever faced more phelps may indeed be better than everyone else but history is littered with examples of people that were supposed to win but didnt in the hyperbolic run up to these games people may have lost sight of a very simple reality the reason nobodys ever won eight gold medals in one games is because its nearly impossible in every race phelps faced specialists some of whom held world records and most races his opponents were more well rested and of course in the relays his success rested partly in the hands of teammates who needed to do stunning things too if you want to know about the burden of crushing expectation ask alexander karelin he was a remarkable athlete who won three gold medals from 1987 2000 he was 59 and 0 but in much of the sporting world he isnt so much remembered for 13 undefeated years as he is for one single loss for thousands of athletes a silver medal would have been a lifetime achievement it wasnt for karelin and wouldnt have been for phelps the stakes for the truly great are simply different phelps knew that for a week he swam with a target on his chest a burden on his back but it never slowed him down he never succumbed to the pressure the type which could turn coal into diamonds and instead minted gold
5093427 we always said definitely if we get on the string and one guy reacts and another guy helps we could be really dominant were playing great basketball right now and one thing we cant do is get satisfied with our success and we have to stay hungry every night we go out on the basketball court
5093428 its been beyond my wildest dreams to be here and surrounded by the greatest athletes in the world get a chance to go see them do what they do best its an unbelievable feeling to be a part of
5093429 you kind of lose control of yourself after a while we kind of know how our fans feel when they watch us play basketball now because you just completely lose it
5093430 i think one thing that we are understanding right now at this point is what it means to be an olympian and what it means to be an american and you know we all wearing the red white and blue for a reason so we all out there supporting each other and we want to all bring home the gold so it was a great showing by the usa today
5093431 well its very special to see an athlete like that that comes along during our time and for us to be present to be there and to see history in the making its very special and hes obviously a unique individual from his god given ability to his work ethic and so forth and so on it was a great honor to be able to watch it
5093432 we have usa on our chest and after seeing what we saw this morning michael phelps win 8th gold medal other usa athletes bringing home the gold you know we cant let our focus slip because we have to do the same
5093433 hes going to wear some paint of those olympic rings before this match is over on that baseline
5093434 the first gold medal point won by gonzalez in this spectacular fashion
5093435 thats incredible scrambling by nadal but that was the best point the best energy that weve had from gonzalez in this third set i think he decided you know what im going to let you get up two sets 5 2 match point and then im going to start trying he saved triple match point in the semifinals
5093436 there it is a familiar sight the 22 year old from mallorca the worlds best right now he wins the gold
5093437 rafael nadal taking over the number one ranking tomorrow showed you why with the way he played at these olympic games
5093438 these two the williams sisters really know how to handle the net position theyre so lanky and so quick up there
5093439 what the williams sisters do have is intimidation and power theyre so powerful with all their shots they cover the net well but even when theyre staying back like you saw if they go after the net person that net person is going to be a little bit uptight
5093440 maybe theyre both disappointed that they didnt get the singles medal but it doesnt show both look extremely excited to have this gold the only tennis medals for the u s
5093441 growing up we watched the olympics watching people like greg louganis and everyone that was so great jackie joyner kersee it was like a dream for us to get here let alone win a gold it was like a dream for us so awesome
5093442 the olympics is really about participation but its also about having your moment in time with my sister someone who i love and support almost more than anyone in the world i would say its just amazing to think that we could participate in a medal for our country and bring home a gold medal im so excited cant even speak
5093443 to be honest it does mean more for me to win it with serena when you can share this kind of moment with your sister were practically joined at the hip its really unexplainable i have chill bumps
5093444 we really wanted to win a medal for our country
5093445 i have an idea actually you know how you have a retractable roof at many of the major league stadiums we need a retractable fence out there when the u s is up because theyre hitting these low line drives and theyre going out so for the opposing team maybe they need to press a button or something
5093446 i think the opposing teams need a go go gadget arm that can reach up and catch those balls because ill tell you what team usa if you play deep they hit it in front of you if you play in they hit it over your head they just have so many powers so many abilities offensively so many weapons to beat you with

5093450 and saluting the great badminton fans and the chinese who are here to win this the greatness of super dan lin dan owns olympic gold
5093451 tremendous tremendous play by lin dan complete control of this match from the beginning to the end there is no question who is the gold medal winner in this

5093471 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
5093472 the jhelum valley route was until the partition the easiest route from the punjab to kashmir it was also convenient for those who wished to proceed towards attock and peshawar from kashmir it also must have been used for kashmirs trade with persia and western turkistan hiuen tsiang and entered kashmir from the west by this route and it is by this route that many learned scholars and sufis from persia and turkistan came to the valley
5093473 we would see the red army in ladakh the green army in the valley and the saffron army in jammu
5093474 fourteen people died in the agitation of 1953 and the slogan was one constitution one flag and one head
5093475 it also said that if all points are met with jammu will still feel discontent since their is a political disparity
5093476 these were pakistan president pervez musharrafs words in an independence day eve function on wednesday shortly after india firmly asked islamabad to stay out of the jammu and kashmir issue
5093477 my address will be incomplete if i dont speak about what is happening in srinagar or indian held kashmir i know and all of you know as well that in the past few days 22 innocent civilians have died including sheikh abdul aziz i condemn this act of human rights violation there is no doubt that every pakistani is with their brothers and sisters in kashmir on this occasion i have no doubt that kashmir beats in the heart of every pakistani and that kashmir runs through pakistans veins therefore every pakistani is with the people of kashmir
5093478 the aim of raw is to keep internal disturbances flaring up and the isi preoccupied so that pakistan can lend no worthwhile resistance to indian designs in the region
5093479 i was speechless yesterday for a while today i cried

5093481 were getting a pretty good taste of what its like to be at the bottom
5093482 the place that has suffered most is south ossetia which is home to both ethnic ossetians and georgians the latter accounting for about a third of the population
5093483 ossetians fleeing the conflict zone talk of georgian atrocities and the indiscriminate killing of civilians
5093484 on august 7 after days of shooting incidents in the south ossetian conflict zone georgian president mikheil saakashvili made a speech in which he said that he had given the georgian villagers orders not to fire that he wanted to offer south ossetia unlimited autonomy within the georgian state with russia to be a guarantor of the arrangement
5093485 both sides said they were discussing a meeting the next day to discuss how to defuse the clashes
5093486 that evening however saakashvili went for the military option the georgian military launched a massive artillery attack on tskhinvali followed the next day by a ground assault involving tanks
5093487 this was a city with no pure military targets full of civilians who had been given no warning and were expecting peace talks at any moment
5093488 the attack looked designed to take everybody by surprise perhaps because much of the russian leadership was in beijing for the opening of the olympic games it also unilaterally destroyed the negotiating and peacekeeping arrangements under the aegis of the organization for security and cooperation in europe that have been in place for 16 years russian peacekeeping troops based in south ossetia were among those killed in the georgian assault

5093499 ossetians fleeing the conflict zone talk of georgian atrocities and the indiscriminate killing of civilians
5093500 on august 7 after days of shooting incidents in the south ossetian conflict zone georgian president mikheil saakashvili made a speech in which he said that he had given the georgian villagers orders not to fire that he wanted to offer south ossetia unlimited autonomy within the georgian state with russia to be a guarantor of the arrangement
5093501 both sides said they were discussing a meeting the next day to discuss how to defuse the clashes
5093502 that evening however saakashvili went for the military option the georgian military launched a massive artillery attack on tskhinvali followed the next day by a ground assault involving tanks

5093548 colors are used as tools of communication to teach reading and math
5093549 books and worksheets come in a rainbow of colors counting beads chalk maps and other activities all include color theres no way that kids who cant see the material will be able to learn it children who are colorblind are easily misdiagnosed with learning disabilities inattentiveness or laziness in school
5093550 the dazzling experience of color begins when light strikes a canvas of tightly packed nerve cells in the back of the eye
5093551 these rods and cones as they are commonly called fire a storm of nerve impulses in response to the light which then travel down the optic nerve to the visual centers of the brain
5093552 we humans are all born colorblind the cones dont begin functioning until a baby is about four months old at that time the baby undergoes a gradual transformation that is as remarkable as the scene in the wizard of oz when dorothy leaves the black and white world of kansas for the brilliant colors of oz
5093553 there is no known way to restore color vision in those who have hereditary colorblindness by being aware of their condition we can help our children learn other ways to distinguish between red and green the position of traffic lights for instance
5093554 we could think of the arctic as the refrigerator of the northern hemisphere climate system
5093555 what were doing by getting rid of that sea ice is radically changing the nature of that refrigerator were making it much less efficient but everything is connected together so what happens up there eventually influences what happens in other parts of the globe
5093556 i think people see the contradiction but i think in the globalised economics of oil and its consumption and demand and the fact that you see record prices for oil that energy companies until the rules of the game change are going to follow the oil even to previously hostile environments and terrains like the arctic youll find energy companies and countries going to all kinds of the ends of the earth in search of these resources

5093570 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it
5093571 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5093572 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5093573 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5093574 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5093575 i think maybe what it said is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution

5093581 at the onset we felt that the governor created the commission in order to build a community effort as we navigate the issues that affect the latino community of rhode island but that has not been the case
5093582 all of us are invested in the rhode island latino community and we would have eagerly embraced the opportunity to advise the governor and his staff on issues important to latinos but we were not given this opportunity
5093583 the state of rhode island needs to look for solutions to our problems in a sensitive way by working together even though the commission was unable to contribute to this effort my peers and i are hopeful that we will be able to create a new more effective political forum for latinos in rhode island
5093584 they said no problem you can send somebody by to pick them up and then we get another call and its whoops we dont have them
5093585 there is apparently no court order authorizing destruction of the property or any record of what happened to the property

5093593 and it was a very important and serious thing that involved national interests and an order from a state leader from the politburo
5093594 it was about presenting the nations music and cultural image especially because it was as the national flag entered the birds nest
5093595 the girl shown on television had to have the most perfect voice and be perfect looking it was fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi
5093596 i have an obligation to make this explanation to the chinese audience
5093597 clever child with indeed a beautiful voice and painting and singing talents
5093598 she is a good child kind hearted cute friendly and low profile with a very calm heart she loves performing peking opera and has participated in shows on international volunteers day
5093599 its harmful to both girls and it is discomforting to know that a girl was instructed to mime while the other had no chance to show her face due to an allegedly unattractive appearance
5093600 why do we have to compromise honesty for these so called national interests
5093601 we received two orders in a row yesterday morning urging us to delete the article immediately and not to allow any publicity on this issue

5093610 we didnt expect miaoke to become so popular overnight and it would be a big embarrassment if miaoke was shaped into a singing star but later it was discovered that she had no musical talent
5093611 this is a smarter way of letting the public know something that it will know sooner or later but i dont think this thing was a big thing to start with
5093612 embarrassed that their beautiful dream of the patriotic song had burst
5093613 there were a number of candidates to sing the song and the artistic directors just picked the best voice and the best performer
5093614 you have to make sure the performance and the song are at the highest level it is a casting or a technical decision by the producer
5093615 you can have different opinions but sport is exactly the same
5093616 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing that hes going to stay on the bench
5093617 i think maybe on this one some people would believe that maybe it was not appropriate but the others would have said its fantastic because the performance was great thats what it is in sport and in life
5093618 we were very pleased with its outcome of one of the most complicated events to organise in the world
5093619 later it was discovered that she had no musical talent
5093620 they made us sign and chop a document saying we would not allow black people in during the olympics
5093621 but no one is willing to say so because well all get deported and have our business shut
5093622 we simply cant let them in during the olympics its what i was told
5093623 its the restrictions on blacks definitely happening it will all happen in 24 hours
5093624 they local police call meetings and everyone has to go or else if you dont go theyll come back and shut you down
5093625 black guys can come in and drink as long as they have valid visas
5093626 but we have been told to watch out for black guys acting suspiciously such as constantly talking on their mobile phones the aim is to crack down on drug dealing
5093627 if this is policy then it is a very bad policy more so for a country holding an olympics
5093628 uniformed public security bureau officers came into the bar recently and told me not to serve black people or mongolians
5093629 i understand that the government is trying to stop certain illegal activities but i dont think blanket discrimination is going about it the right way
5093630 chinese people are prejudiced but i would have hoped that the government would set a better example as it debuts on the world stage
5093631 the officials told me to inform my customers that they must at all times carry their passports or id cards
5093632 security is important but beijing is becoming a fortress and thats not attractive
5093633 the local police told us to get rid of the tables because theyre scared that if too many foreigners congregate outside there could be trouble
5093634 the whole music scene is angry and bewildered it is impossible to understand how keeping tourists from seeing an open culturally vibrant and diverse beijing is possibly a good thing for anyone
5093635 it appears the local government is trying to control every aspect of the experience that foreigners get when they come here
5093636 everything is aimed at creating stability but they dont understand that is precisely the unfounded prejudice that foreigners have of chinese society that it is a highly controlled and not a very cultural place it seems completely self defeating
5093637 width of the nose and the length of the face
5093638 it is a tradition in china that at events costumes of the different ethnic groups are worn to symbolize that they live together peacefully and in happiness

5093648 mick davis is a very clever man he has very cleverly put a bid on the table reflecting a movement of metals prices generally but we are in a different niche and it is a very good niche
5093649 there is an awful lot of doom and gloom in the stock markets and cash is king you cannot expect people not to take a pile of cash when it is on the table
5093650 we are concerned that shareholders because of the general state of the markets may be tempted to accept an offer that would deprive them of exposure to a hugely attractive business in a hugely attractive industry
5093651 platinum group metals should be disconnected from all other metals two months ago the stronger for longer price scenario based on infrastructure growth in china and india was to a certain extent exploded and metals prices fell off a cliff and platinum was no exception
5093652 but the dynamics that drive the platinum price are completely different to those that drive copper steel and iron ore
5093653 the platinum price is driven by the number of cars put on the road and the ever tightening emissions regulations in every country in the world
5093654 over the last several years i have expected mick davis to come calling i always thought that when that happened seeing as there are only three major platinum producers in the world there would be a feeding frenzy

5093729 she is a good child kind hearted cute friendly and low profile with a very calm heart she loves performing peking opera and has participated in shows on international volunteers day
5093730 its harmful to both girls and it is discomforting to know that a girl was instructed to mime while the other had no chance to show her face due to an allegedly unattractive appearance
5093731 why do we have to compromise honesty for these so called national interests

5093743 embarrassed that their beautiful dream of the patriotic song had burst
5093744 there were a number of candidates to sing the song and the artistic directors just picked the best voice and the best performer
5093745 you have to make sure the performance and the song are at the highest level it is a casting or a technical decision by the producer
5093746 you can have different opinions but sport is exactly the same
5093747 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing that hes going to stay on the bench
5093748 i think maybe on this one some people would believe that maybe it was not appropriate but the others would have said its fantastic because the performance was great thats what it is in sport and in life
5093749 we were very pleased with its outcome of one of the most complicated events to organise in the world

5093752 but no one is willing to say so because well all get deported and have our business shut
5093753 we simply cant let them in during the olympics its what i was told
5093754 its the restrictions on blacks definitely happening it will all happen in 24 hours
5093755 they local police call meetings and everyone has to go or else if you dont go theyll come back and shut you down
5093756 black guys can come in and drink as long as they have valid visas
5093757 but we have been told to watch out for black guys acting suspiciously such as constantly talking on their mobile phones the aim is to crack down on drug dealing
5093758 if this is policy then it is a very bad policy more so for a country holding an olympics
5093759 uniformed public security bureau officers came into the bar recently and told me not to serve black people or mongolians

5093778 before traveling here from baltimore phelps mother debbie received a letter from a teacher barbara kines who had taught phelps in the third grade before he found an outlet for his energies in swimming phelps had immense difficulties concentrating and sitting still leading one of his grade school teachers to wonder if he would ever be able to focus on anything kines wrote about how proud she was of phelps and how perhaps it had never been focus he lacked but rather a goal worthy of his focus
5093779 it is a fantastic feeling to win the olympics and im glad that i managed to repeat it
5093780 i feel excellent i have trained for this all my life
5093781 i hope i will have a chance to compete in the olympics in london in 2012

5093783 due to heavy rain the organisers postponed finals in the canoe double and semi finals as well as finals in the kayak single category for august 15
5093784 after the successes of brothers peter and pavol hochschorner and elena kalisk in qualifications on august 13 semi finals and finals were on the programme but only the semi finals in double canoe took place the brothers finished second
5093785 this complicates the lives of athletes as well as their coaches they not only need to tune up again for another competition day but they also have to solve organisational things as they had planned to leave beijing on friday

5093793 people are cleaning out their closets so we get a lot of inventory at a time when there is a lot of demand for school clothes
5093794 i think everyone is taking a step back trying to figure out ways to save money
5093795 people are also into recycling more and are finding they can get some trendy quality clothes
5093796 this is the busiest time of year for buying then in december it gets busy again as consigners get their cash from previous sales to do some holiday shopping
5093797 recycling has been a big part of this neighborhood since we first started
5093798 whats fun is seeing people who came here as kids come in with their own kids
5093799 at first we had trouble keeping those clothes in stock but that trend has stuck around so we get a lot of those clothes coming in and going out
5093800 everyone wants them these days so thats something thats hard to keep in stock
5093801 its busy enough right now even when were not thinking about the move
5093802 were probably better off putting off the move while people are doing their back to school shopping

5093890 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5093891 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

5093896 to develop an effective approach to informing young women about this risk factor for breast cancer we need a better understanding of young women
5093897 as part of a study funded by the canadian breast cancer research alliance we are consulting young women age 15 to 24 from across the country on this topic to do this we have been conducting focus groups and are implementing an online survey to reach other women
5093898 the locations were chosen because of the provinces different smoking rates b c has the lowest provincial prevalence rate for smoking 15 per cent with new brunswick among the provinces with the highest rates 22 per cent the web based survey is intended to build on the knowledge gathered through focus groups by reaching out to a wider audience of young women the results of the survey will be used to prepare for a larger national study
5093899 the beetle has a one year life cycle so you wont be able to tell that theres been damage most of the trees that are being attacked right for up to 9 12 months
5093900 sometimes after the tree has been compromised woodpeckers will come in and strip the bark off its then you start to see trees turning yellow and red
5093901 the beetles are carried by the wind but they also fly most of the bug infestations are on the westside in the lodge pole pine populations at high elevations i expect thats where theyre coming from
5093902 a lot is dependent on weather i think a lot of the beetles would prefer to stay up in the high elevation forests where there is a lot of food the unpredictable factor is how quickly they will build up in the city
5093903 its pretty much run its course in the north and central interior sometime over the next five years we expect the beetles will have run out of food theyll either be dispersed into new areas or just die out he says b c experienced a pine beetle infestation in the early 1900s paula findlay of edmonton won the female junior elite matt vierula of ottawa was the male winner photo contributed by contributed story 41197 aug 16 2008 8 29 pm paula findlay of edmonton repeated her 2007 performance by winning the female junior elite category in the 2008 canadian national triathlon championships in the pushor mitchell apple triathlon in kelowna despite temperatures exceeding 35 c on the day paula improved her time of last year in 58 07 matt vierula of ottawa was the male winner and finished the 750m swim 20km cycle and 5km run in 54 53 competition was very strong in the male category with matt sharpe of victoria in second place in 54 57 third place went to cole stewart of langley in 55 08 one of saturdays competitors at the finish line photo rachael kimola apple try a tri results by contributed story 41196 kelowna and westbank first time triathletes competed in the pushor mitchell kelowna apple triathlon saturday completing the try a tri 300 m swim 15 km bike 3 km run in good spirit and sunny weather results were females 1st 49 33 laura ransom kelowna 2nd 50 03 jodi walsh westbank 3rd 53 28 anna page lumby males 1st 50 04 jared verstaete kelowna 2nd 50 08 aaron wells westbank 3rd 50 54 jim faulkner enderby the kids of steel showed determination and endurance in the 500 m swim 15 km bike and 4 km run in the age group 8 9 years desirae ridenour of cowichan finished first in 21 58 with jordan hopkins of victoria winning the boys 8 9 in 23 13 age group 10 11 was won by cordell dickie of kelowna in 31 30 and courtney chanin of queen charlotte winning the girls in 33 42 spencer burns of powell river 44 40 was the winner in the boys 12 13 section and robynne shannon of vancouver in the girls in 44 44 winner for boys 14 15 was riley maccharles in 47 00 and gabrielle edwards of saskatoon in girls 52 21 the 16 19 age group race of 750 m swim 20 km bike and a 5 km run was won by fraser cashion of port coquitlam in 1 03 39 and allegra rogers of westbank was first female in with 1 11 35 results of the junior elite races will be made available soon with temperatures of mid 30s expected sunday the age group sprint elite and olympic distance races are expected to be very tough by rcmp story 41195 aug 16 2008 7 20 pm rcmp are looking for a suspect after a early morning rape in kelownas downtown core police say that a lone female was walking near the 1400 block of richter street at approximately 2 00 am saturday she was approached by an unknown male and after a brief conversation was attacked and assaulted the male suspect is described as follows caucasian male approx age between 21 25 years of age approx height 5 6

5093907 we had been ramping up and we were throwing human resources at our growth and then we hit the wall in late fall
5093908 weve had to pull back this year just for the sake of trying to be smart about expansion
5093909 almost universally business spending is being scaled down to the absolute bare minimum
5093910 a few months ago all those people were talking about a second half recovery if theres a second half recovery its the second half of 09
5093911 you had record high profits but hiring remained very lean throughout this expansion
5093912 an economic slowdown is always going to choke off business investment but this time we could get several quarters of very low spending
5093913 given the current environment it simply does not make economic sense for us to grow our capacity in 2009
5093914 if you want to continue to do business with us in 2009 your rates had better be flat or well find another vendor

5093994 der durchbruch ist geschafft wie stefan sich behauptet hat war gnadenlos gut
5093995 der titel ist weg 60 punkte bei sechs rennen sind zu viel
5093996 aber in diesem jahr bleibt das ziel in jedem rennen aufs podium zu fahren und n chstes jahr wollen wir in der wm unter die ersten drei und vielleicht sogar weltmeister werden
5093997 denn wir hatten in jedem training kleine technische probleme und dann kamen auch noch die kritischen wetterbedingungen dazu im warmup hatten wir daher einiges zu testen und es funktionierte wirklich gut nach dem start habe ich alles gegeben und sofort versucht an die spitze zu kommen leider konnte ich mich nicht sofort von den anderen absetzen was aber sp ter gelang zum schluss konnte ich den abstand nach hinten etwas kontrollieren und ich fuhr den sieg nach hause ein gro artiges gef hl
5093998 schon im warmup hatten wir bemerkt dass hier mehr gehen kann als bisher
5093999 stefan hatte sich sehr wohl gef hlt und sichtlich spa am fahren wir waren f r das rennen sehr zuversichtlich im rennen selbst haben wir definitiv die richtige reifenwahl getroffen hatten einen super motor und stefan behielt bei der harten konkurrenz im r cken die nerven

5094134 the petroleum group has the best chance of bringing home some big numbers this year following record high oil prices wiseowl com senior equities analyst simon guzowski said
5094135 the other major commodity earner for them is copper and while prices have fallen away in the last few weeks to a six month low up to june 30 prices were not far off record highs so that has to be a positive for bhps earnings he said
5094136 if bhp is able to demonstrate stronger growth in its production numbers than rio it would look to use these to try to convince asian buyers and european regulators that commodity supply is more likely to rise under a merged group he said
5094137 a number of miners have been hit quite hard by rising fuel processing machinery and labour costs mr guzowski said
5094138 were expecting a great result but because youve had so much change over the last month particularly in these commodity prices coming off the market will be more focused on those issues going forward stock resource managing director stephen bartrop said
5094139 the fact that the oil price is coming off its highs is a negative in the sense that the increase in earnings momentum for bhp is going to be diminished

5094184 we ran our two minute offense the entire game in stephenville
5094185 ive gotten so accustomed to calling the no huddle hurry up spread offense it would seem slow and mundane to call any other style
5094186 on the flip side it might have been the best thing for my career
5094187 i remember running play after play after play in the first practice after i got home i went to bed and slept half the day
5094188 in our offense last year we might have five seconds left on the clock when wed run a play
5094189 this year we probably wont even use five seconds before we run the next play
5094190 anything less than another state title would be a disappointment
5094191 ive traveled everywhere and i cant stay put kirkland said

5094195 people say what they have to say but we dont let it affect us said texas cornerback ryan palmer
5094196 the last team that fired us up the results spoke for themselves its happened before but we cant get into all of that we know that on aug 30 we will be ready to play
5094197 i havent called anybody out in 56 years he said
5094198 designed to protect bald and golden eagle populations while providing the flexibility necessary for people to manage their land and businesses this program would allow issuance of permits under the bald and golden eagle protection act authorizing activities that may disturb eagles require nest removal or otherwise result in the death of or injury to a bird
5094199 the u s fish and wildlife service is developing new measures to ensure that eagle populations continue to thrive while providing a way to manage the impacts of development such a permit structure will enable the service to reduce the risk to eagles since it allows biologists to work with permit applicants to reduce potential threats
5094200 the draft environmental assessment lays out the biological foundation for a proposed nationwide permit program and examines the impacts of the new permit proposal within the context of all threats to eagles it proposes upper limits to how many eagles can be taken conditioned on increasing or stable populations under the preferred alternative the issuance of any permit authorizing the disturbance of eagles removal of nests or activities that could otherwise take an eagle would be based on the eagle population of the area

5094217 i know some people turn their nose down a bit at the prospect that people could save 10 or so on a tank of petrol but we dont
5094218 we think its a very important part of having a more competitive petrol market and we intend to fight for it in the senate
5094219 if mr swan thinks fuelwatch will save motorists 10 a tank hes deluding himself and misleading the australian people
5094220 all of the evidence is that fuelwatch will reduce competition and our most price sensitive motorists will end up paying more for their petrol
5094221 if mr swan cant get his sums right on this how can we have any confidence in his management of our 1 trillion economy

5094224 the safir ambassador rocket was successfully launched all its systems are iranian made
5094225 we have paved the way for placing a satellite in space in the future
5094226 the second launch of the safir rocket carrying the first satellite omid was conducted successfully
5094227 the iranian media is mistaken it was the launch of a rocket capable of carrying a satellite the omid satellite was not launched itself
5094228 the achievement has drawn much attention from around the world especially from among muslim nations as iran is under sanctions by the west and the security council making it develop the technology and build all parts and equipment needed in the field of aerospace
5094229 this satellite the rocket and the launch station are entirely iranian built achieved by particularly talented scientists and technicians
5094230 we have succeeded in upgrading the capabilities of our planes and have increased the range of these planes to 3 000 kilometers without refuelling

5094239 its what we wanted to have tonight it was great when spain made their run and at the end of the first half were sitting there with a five point lead we hadnt been tested like that
5094240 it was good that we got tested and things didnt go our way
5094241 we got into the locker room and there was no sense of panic at some point we were going to go through a stretch like that and its better we faced it now so that were prepared for later
5094242 stuff like that happens during a game when both teams are playing physical you just step up hit your free throws and move on
5094243 theyve made some strides during the offseason learning our offense and getting stronger and getting prepared for the season
5094244 it was the same last year we had little experience on the offensive line but everyone here is willing to step up for the good of the team
5094245 if you take us all somewhere we can wreck a buffet
5094246 if you do good theyll also look at you and youll get your opportunities to shine at your position
5094247 it almost puts the spotlight more on us to get the job done but then at the same time it also motivates you to get it done
5094248 we may have all that talent but if we dont execute were going to fall into mediocrity
5094249 we have not accepted these patients they are brought here we are mandated by law federal law to provide care a medical assessment and treatment
5094250 we need the help of all of our elected official on all levels of the united states to help turn the tide of violence in mexico and the violence in juarez this is a trend that is disturbing it is a trend that we need to bring attention to so we can get help from federal and local agencies
5094251 bordering on juarez the most violent city in mexico and one of the most violent cities anywhere besides iraq youre always vigilant

5094272 im going to be as radical a social reformer as mrs thatcher was an economic reformer and radical social reform is what this country needs right now margaret thatcher in her time realised that the big challenge was reviving britains economy and we should recognise that the challenge for the modern conservatives is reviving our society its dealing with the issues of family breakdown welfare dependency failing schools crime and the problems that we see in too many of our communities that will be our priority
5094273 had we been capitalized or had we been the offshoot of a large corporation the way i wanted to be we might not ever have tried the harrisons or the rogers or the springdales and all those other little towns we went into in the early days it turned out that the first big lesson we learned was that there was much much more business out there in small town america than anybody including me had ever dreamed of
5094274 we are not authorized to when i talked already with beijing authorities we agreed its not for us to go out and make public air quality data in my view its a perfectly normal agreement as a scientist you do not publish data obtained by others i have a very great difficulty understanding all the fuss around this

5094312 as long as they are not found guilty they remain only accused and there is nothing authorities can do about the couple
5094313 it is exceptional the degree to which the militarys currently relying on such contractors
5094314 were of a much smaller scale than what we are seeing in iraq
5094315 the cost of having an army contingent provide the same services as blackwater appears to be roughly the same as the cost of the contract itself
5094316 the augusteum in rome warns us not to get attached to any obsolete ideas of who we are what we represent whom we belong to or what function we may once have intended to serve

5094323 we are going to open diplomatic relations with our cuban brothers and their government
5094324 you are correct in identifying the shrinking of humanitarian space and the problems of confusions between the military and humanitarian purposes of foreigners who are here
5094325 the international rescue committee is firmly committed to protecting humanitarian space and distinguishing humanitarian workers from any military employees

5094328 we will work on accomplishing it within the coming weeks
5094329 such a decision will be followed by some logistical measures which need to be taken by both countries in order to put the agreement into effect
5094330 the ones we know about have committed criminal offenses in syria
5094331 we inquired about other people and we are still waiting for a response from syrian officials
5094332 later the cabinet will issue a separate decree for an embassy in syria
5094333 then all that remains in front of us are procedural steps which the two foreign ministries will be tasked with taking
5094334 the syrians do not need an embassy to operate in lebanon they have their intelligence as well as their allies
5094335 referring the issue of lebanese prisoners in syrian jails to committees is equivalent to killing it we all know that forming committees will not help in resolving the issue
5094336 demarcating borders in the shebaa farms area will help liberate the occupied territory whereas excluding it aims at creating pretexts for hizbullah to hold on to its arms
5094337 we are not saying that to turn our back to discussing a defense strategy for lebanon but to say that there are other important issues which need to be discussed during national dialogue sessions
5094338 we need to address economic and social issues as well as ways to implement the decisions that were taken during earlier dialogue sessions
5094339 we shouldnt criminalize the health care decisions of doctors and women to fight abortion
5094340 my church teaches and i do believe that human rights begin early in life at conception or shortly thereafter and that is my personal belief
5094341 i dont believe the force of criminal law should compel others to necessarily follow that to the greatest degree
5094342 we take john mccain for his word and his record
5094343 i do not follow paul or apollos or of spurgeon but christ
5094344 driscoll is remarkably open in a way that would shame some people i like him
5094345 well can i remember the manner in which i learned the doctrines of grace in a single instant born as all of us are by nature an arminian i still believed the old things i had heard continually from the pulpit and did not see the grace of god
5094346 he died on the cross and was buried to be a sacrifice both for original sincand for all human transgressions and to reconcile us to god
5094347 we sure are close to the field seattle vs chicago
5094348 hey youre at the cool table so you better be ready to party it up
5094349 today is a joyous one for looks down at his book fumbling briefly for the names john and emily
5094350 im just a hot guy who others like to watch for inspiration
5094351 i notice you watching me did you want my autograph
5094352 ela apesar de emocionada manteve os nervos no lugar e disse apenas coisas bonitas e tocantes mas se fosse eu o galv o seria convidado a tomar naquele lugar
5094353 aw man theyre not here anymore woo hoo free bed
5094354 ya know i havent been to tb in a while and ive really wanted to
5094355 please put me on your email by doing this you are creating a service and maintaining the
5094356 go ahead and stay home for the rest of the week i dont want you to push yourself too hard
5094357 the speed and weight of money behind this move has been quite breathtaking
5094358 commodity booms end ugly they always do and there has never been an exception
5094359 this downswing is more consistent with the global economic fundamentals
5094360 the commodity markets are more central to australian national income than either credit markets or share markets
5094361 prices for our commodity exports are still at generational highs and ongoing demand from emerging economies give us some cause for optimism despite slowing global growth
5094362 buyers reacted positively to speculation about a drop in interest rates by the reserve bank leading to an improvement in the clearance rate
5094363 they may not be out there bidding strongly yet but they are starting to think this is the end
5094364 buyers and sellers still seem to be sitting on the fence a bit it seems to be a given that the rba will reduce rates next month but the big question on everyones lips is will the banks pass on the full rate cut
5094365 there is a lot of stock about to hit the market in september and october and this rate cut would certainly be very pleasing and greeted warmly by people it will be the spark that we need for the rest of the year
5094366 we want freedom indians go home and kashmir is ours
5094367 were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5094368 the greatest part is we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle
5094369 hes just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us thats what we have to keep doing is to try and win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground
5094370 he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5094371 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5094372 what were doing here is a little bit of practicing for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car carl edwards did a great job the pit crew did a great job
5094373 it just came down to when he beat us off of pit road
5094374 that was it for us we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys we were good on that one run that one set of tires but that was pretty much what we had
5094375 we just didnt have enough for the no 99 there at the end we werent able to get through the corners as fast as carl was
5094376 we were a nine out of a 10 it seems like and those other guys were a 10 out of a 10
5094377 just to gamble a little bit on staying on track we knew at worst that we would still finish in the top five it was something to take a shot we certainly learned from it if we had to do it all over again wed probably still do it again
5094378 as they have every day since they arrived a week ago only to come back a few hours later
5094379 are always coming out in small groups and we dont know how many are inside
5094380 any notion that russia was the kind of responsible state ready to integrate into international institutions
5094381 i think that there has been an effort by three successive american presidents to try and coax russia into an integrated role in the international community
5094382 we thought that they were headed in that direction we now have to reevaluate all that
5094383 it wants to be part of these institutions that are so essential to the international economy and the international order
5094384 it wants to engage in kind of soviet style behavior of intimidating and invading allies or neighbors
5094385 what the president has done is to open a path for russia that would have been different than the path of the soviet union
5094386 russia that has misjudged what would happen if it did not take that path
5094387 it has nothing to do obviously with the conflict that began in south ossetia
5094388 i think that the whole world is looking at russia through a different set of lenses the longer they take to get out and to observe the cease fire thats been declared and the arrangements that have been worked out i think the greater those consequences will be
5094389 russia has given continuous promises to hold to the ceasefire but in fact they are continuing their actions they are widening their zone of occupation
5094390 sooner or later yes but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave
5094391 began to ring like a political campaign instead of principled and strong diplomacy
5094392 presumptuous is to try to undercut in any way the very difficult and tricky work that president bush and secretary rice are trying to do right now
5094393 he called for an international peacekeeping force he called for humanitarian aid he called it exactly what it is unprovoked aggression
5094394 if we were georgians and the russians were invading our country and killing our people wed bet in a state of war
5094395 john sometimes is given to this kind of bellicose rhetoric which has a tendency to inflame conflicts rather than to diffuse them
5094396 senator obama to this day to this day denies the value and the strategic benefit of the surge
5094397 because the bush mccain approach has been to focus almost exclusively on iraq over the last five years a lot of these issues have gone without the kind of attention they deserve
5094398 we thought that the russians were headed in the direction of an integrated role in the international community we now have to reevaluate all that
5094399 do not lie do not participate in a lie do not support a lie
5094400 theres a real concern that russia has turned a corner here and is headed back to its past rather than its future
5094401 stick the long and hard one up the collective keisters of little bush amp co

5094416 i dont think you can control all the world from one centre
5094417 there are big nations there are huge populations there is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world so what we have to do is instead of unilateral actions act all together make common decisions and have consultations with the world a new world order if i can say it should emerge
5094418 there are so many important issues like the nuclear issue iraq the caucasus afghanistan
5094419 iran is definitely having some influence of these issues so we are talking
5094420 we dont want to see weapons of mass destruction in this region
5094421 if its in our neighbourhood we definitely dont want to see it
5094422 i dont want to think about that everybody should take a lesson from what happened in iraq
5094423 i wish to see turkey as an island where the european standard of democracy is being fulfilled and the free market economy is functioning very well
5094424 this will be a real gift to the region to the world for peace
5094425 as we are transforming ourselves in that direction we will not forget our natural links and relationships and advantages with other countries muslim countries central asian countries caucasus countries middle eastern and other countries
5094426 turkey is having a positive impact on them spreading the values of democracy freedom rule of law also the economic changes here are admired maybe that is the indirect influence of this country
5094427 in the last two years we spent our energy on domestic issues and the reforms slowed down
5094428 now after the court case there is a new era this is a big opportunity for turkey everybody realises that reforms are necessary
5094429 turkey has great capacity to influence the region indirectly very peacefully being an inspiration for changes turkey has been playing this role already this has not been appreciated enough
5094430 europe should realise that turkey can do more for the stability and security of the region
5094431 start with the caucasus last month the problem was not serious but suddenly we found ourselves in a war situation
5094432 europe should encourage turkey and not create some artificial problems during the negotiation process with us some member countries or some politicians should not mix domestic issues and strategic issues domestic issues are conjunctural today its there and tomorrow its not but the strategic issues are always there and we cannot sacrifice strategic issues for domestic issues unfortunately nowadays we see this kind of shortsighted policies in some countries
5094433 some call it terror some call it the south east problem some call it the kurdish problem whatever you call it we will find a solution
5094434 there are other problems secularism and anti secularism those things will also find solutions in this climate that is why i focus on the reform process the problem was this the lack of democracy the standard of democracy that was creating problems not only in the south east but in other issues that is when we upgrade the standards these problems will find solutions
5094435 ive been poly for a whole two years so i can tell you all about it
5094436 la democracia es el gobierno del pueblo por el pueblo para el pueblo

5094440 or do you not know that your body is a temple of the holy spirit within you whom you have from god you are not your own
5094441 while we are looking at god we do not see ourselves blessed riddance the man who has struggled to purify himself and has had nothing but repeated failures will experience real relief when he stops tinkering with his soul and looks away to the perfect one while he looks at christ the very thing he has so long been trying to do will be getting done within him
5094442 there are obviously several provisions of the moa that contradict the constitution
5094443 on its face is patently illegal under our present laws
5094444 fr joaquin bernas may be right the moa is just a scrap of paper
5094445 youre giving me the impression this is mere fear of the unknown how can you fear something that does not exist
5094446 the discussion whether we need to be here should have taken place two days ago
5094447 as has been stated we have a constitutional obligation when we are here to do what needs to be done
5094448 that constitutional obligation should go past politics the politics shold be left behind whether we can agree on it or not
5094449 i havent always been a favorite of the fourth floor but were here we are hare we have an obligation to the people of this great state whether we like to be here or not is not the issue forget the politics for a while

5094451 theres an immediate need to bring all parties to a common consensus to take the country forward
5094452 we have already finished destroying the roots of feudalism in nepal
5094453 under prachandas leadership the main agenda of the new administration will be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation
5094454 prachanda said the new government will be forming economic policies based on suggestions by business people and industrialists
5094455 he also said there would be no curtailing of profits and that the party is eager to work with the private sector
5094456 weve lots of challenges ahead of us but we also have a whole new spirit to confront them
5094457 while i was shopping just across the street i heard a huge explosion
5094458 body parts were flying through the air i immediately realized that farooqs party was targeted and he was probably dead
5094459 we had received information that we would be targeted by groups within azamiyah and within the awakening movement itself
5094460 to err is human and to blame it on a computer is even more so
5094461 ohh boys the most irritating thing on the face of the planet

5094463 compared to last year tennessee continues to see job losses in manufacturing professional business services and financial activities employment
5094464 at the same time we are experiencing year to year gains in educational and health services employment and in local government educational services
5094465 the usa is engaged in an anti missile defence for its own government and not for poland and poland in deploying elements of the system opens itself to a military strike that is 100 percent
5094466 it is written clearly we will use it in instances against governments that have nuclear weapons against allies of countries with nuclear weapons if they somehow enable them
5094467 becomes an actionable object those targets are destroyed in the first order
5094468 in view of americas determination to set up a missile defence shield in europe the military is reviewing all its plans to give washington an adequate response
5094469 it is really unfortunate that russia chooses to react by putting nuclear warheads in different places if indeed it does that when the rest of the world is not looking at some kind of old fashioned superpower conflict
5094470 african countries are not using alternative power supplies since international combines do not encourage the switch indeed the use of such technologies may damage their business
5094471 i recognize that my results are caused by my past mindsets my new mindsets are bringing me now the desired results meaning i am control and i create the circumstances
5094472 but apparently my thumb is beyond the limits of science
5094473 i spent a lot of time thinking about how the brain should work if i had designed it
5094474 you cant have all these cells interacting with each other unless theres some logic to the interaction
5094475 it just looked like noise though no one could crack the code
5094476 there are so many different ways to describe what the brain does
5094477 you can talk about what a particular cell is doing or look at brain regions with fmri or observe behavior but how do these things connect because you know they are connected you just dont know how
5094478 you cant really understand the brain until you understand how these social behaviors happen or what happens when they go haywire
5094479 at first i thought it was unlikely that an individual cell could represent anything so complicated
5094480 it just seemed like too much information for one neuron
5094481 only in retrospect can i appreciate just how lucky we were
5094482 it was very very tough to figure out what these cells were encoding
5094483 it was just so clearly the most efficient way to learn
5094484 he was very excited and shoved these figures from some new paper in my face
5094485 he kept on saying to me what does this look like
5094486 dayan was a big prankster and i assumed hed photocopied some of our own figures on tdrl just to tease me it looked too good to be true
5094487 is because we came at it from this theoretical angle if you were an experimentalist seeing this data it would have been extremely confusing what the hell are these cells doing why arent they just responding to the juice
5094488 it got bounced from every journal i came this close to leaving the field i realized that neuroscience just wasnt ready for theory even if the theory made sense
5094489 they just didnt understand how these funny looking equations could explain their data they told us we need more data but whats the point of data if you cant figure it out
5094490 you learn how the world works by focusing on the prediction errors on the events that you didnt expect
5094491 heres this elegant learning system but how does it fit with the rest of the brain and can we take this beyond apple juice
5094492 one of the distinguishing traits of human beings is that we chase ideas not just primary rewards
5094493 what other animal goes on hunger strike or abstains from sex or blows itself up in a cafe in the name of god
5094494 the guy whos on hunger strike for some political cause is still relying on his midbrain dopamine neurons just like a monkey getting a treat
5094495 his brain simply values the cause more than it values dinner
5094496 its clear that you need some way to compare your options even if your options come from very different categories
5094497 you dont have to dig very far before it all comes back to your loins
5094498 the most unrealistic element of fmri experiments is that we could only study the brain by itself
5094499 youd be updating your expectations based not just on what happened but on what might have happened if youd done something differently
5094500 i just assumed that evolution would use this approach because its too good an idea not to use
5094501 when youre addicted to a drug your brain is basically convinced that this expensive white powder is worth more than your marriage or life
5094502 a mob or a market is not just a collection of discrete individuals
5094503 its something else entirely you would do things in a group that you would never do by yourself but whats happening in your brain weve got all these sociological studies but no hard data
5094504 stunning shocking even for me the lesson has been that people act very badly in groups and now we can see why
5094505 i want the largest birds with the fullest bellies to constantly be flying overhead the fans of the bronze fonz
5094506 its a truly symbiotic relationship i give a present to the birds and the birds give a present to the bronze fonz fans
5094507 you just dont pick up things you like doing by chance
5094508 by deploying poland is exposing itself to a strike 100
5094509 wasnt he the guy who did that i have a dream speech
5094510 i am confident in this that he who began a good work in you shall finish it
5094511 i dont see the need for a new kind of christian instead i see a need for believers who will seek after the heart of god standing without compromise on the hills to die on many seek to dilute the gospel trying to drown it with a flood of uncertainty and looking to negate mans need for atonement from sin they will not succeed
5094512 if your dear heart is wounded my wild heart bleeds with yours in the rapture of my enormous humiliation i live in your warm life and you shall die die sweetly die into mine listen de world
5094513 due to a person under a train the central line is closed
5094514 in 1998 i found myself watching baseball history in the making as mark mcgwire and sammy sosa battled it out for the top spot in the home run race the closer they got to the record set by roger maris the angrier i found myself getting after all roger maris went through hell to set that record in 1961 the powers that be thought that no one would ever surpass babe ruths record of 60 home runs in one season and here was maris about to break that record while playing for the very same team in an attempt to keep ruths record alive they placed an asterisk next to maris record to explain that he hit the home runs in a season that contained more games than ruths record season
5094515 when it comes to american history there are a few subjects that have grabbed my attention to the extent that i decided to research them on my own the civil war and the vietnam war these wars fascinated me
5094516 esp has super parallel write and read operations that are coupled with an accelerated flash data bus architecture to allow data to be transferred at twice the rate of most competitive cards in addition the esp architecture streamlines every aspect of read and write data transfer operations through advanced hardware automation the esp architecture effectively removes the card as the bottleneck in data storage applications

5094545 we stayed in touch with visionshares feikema over a six month period of time
5094546 we got to the point when we looked at the business the most important question we asked and which really stopped john was what would you do if someone gave you 10 million how would you invest 10 million to grow this business
5094547 his first reaction was i dont know what i would do with 10 million
5094548 okay im scared this person is losing it on me
5094549 am i going to take this or not does this feel peaceful or not can i change this situation or not do i need some help to help me change this situation
5094550 if i asked you to meet me in a hotel room in denver tomorrow night would you do that
5094551 sir were packed up we could use a hand carrying everything back to the gate
5094552 let me set up the place im good at stuff like that
5094553 you keep that up this partys gonna be over really soon
5094554 go ahead and come okay thats what i want now
5094555 i couldnt believe you would actually do this i still cant really believe it
5094556 pretty believable just now doesnt get much realer than this
5094557 god you feel so good we should clean up but i cant move
5094558 good thing about a hotel right somebody else does the laundry
5094559 i have a very clear and detailed version of you giving that speech in my head you know
5094560 if you hadnt noticed your record of talking me into crazy wacked out things is pretty much unbroken
5094561 listen daniel youve always had this available are you just now figuring out that i always do pretty much whatever you ask reasonable or unreasonable
5094562 okay i guess i did know that and its still scary
5094563 you just hate the responsibility of making the date being the one to ask
5094564 jack jack how you look how it looks you doing that
5094565 and again with the not believing you would let me do anything certainly never let me jack have you ever even been with another man before at all
5094566 im im what surprised embarrassingly turned on at the notion of getting to do that for you god jack
5094567 you remember when i went to moscow with paul to try to negotiate for their dhd this is like that
5094568 what youre saying that having sex with me is like negotiating with the russians
5094569 or if what you mean is you had wild russian hotel sex with davis i really dont want to know
5094570 no no nothing like that what i mean is i had to skip a lot of steps with them i had the chance to ask them to put everything on the table jump right to giving us their dhd and i did
5094571 yeah well thats kind of what im afraid of here
5094572 but my point is its all on the table now with us isnt it
5094573 well im no negotiator as you well know but i do know something about poker
5094574 the way i see it you had the nerve to call the bluff on this flirtation thing weve had simmering and in poker you know when the hand is called thats it everyone has to show their cards
5094575 and then the winners collect and the deals over and a new game starts and this night will end and well go home tomorrow go back to work go out in the field
5094576 we put it all on the table here some of us more literally than others
5094577 your ass i think it was and a mighty fine ass it is too
5094578 but will we do this again or is the game over now after this one hand
5094579 no you asked me if we will i asked if you want to

5094857 well so much for that i am surprised that the press corp didnt hang these guys for wasting their time this means the next time some legitimate story is in the offering they may well pass it by
5094858 there are plenty of things we can take away from the incident to use in a positive way for instance does every researcher group or organization have a notification protocol does everyone know who theyre going to call when they actually find a body how theyre going to document it and move it where theyre going to take it since theyll probably be in a remote area how are they going to make that notification cell phone radio or smoke signals in law enforcement wherever our investigations took us we could rely on the assistance and brotherhood of the other agencies throughout the county the state the country even the world id like to think we can have that kind of brotherhood within this community

5094860 there is a great myth that the republican party has perpetuated that they are better for defense than the democratic party and that they are good for veterans nothing could be further from the truth said retired u s army major general
5094861 we have suffered eight years of significant underfunding and underfocus from this administration and my great fear is a mccain administration would continue that process

5094871 man kann aus der anthropologie keine ethik ableiten annahmen beeinflussen das handeln reflektiert oder unreflektiert
5094872 ich habe nicht mal gesagt dass ich eines habe sollten wir eines haben ich bin da sehr zur ckhaltend was mein menschenbild betrifft
5094873 sind geistig behinderte menschen wirklich personen und kommt ihnen menschenw rde zu deswegen bin ich der meinung man sollte sich m glichst kein menschenbild machen ich finde es wichtig wie man mit menschen umgeht
5094874 kann man eine wesensaussage ber den menschen machen ich sage nein
5094875 hegel meinte man k nnte zu einem absoluten wissen kommen ein absolutes wissen ist f r den menschen unerreichbar wir k nnen uns nie sicher sein ob unsere hypothesen richtig sind in der wissenschaftlichen theorie gibt es keine absolute sicherheit w ir haben ein provisorisches wissen all unser wissen bleibt st ckwerk wir kommen nie zur wirklichkeit wenn wir zu wesensaussagen kommen w rden dann w rde das wesen ja erfasst wie wollen anthropologen ber sich wesensaussagen machen das schwierigste ist sich selbst zu erkennen jedes mal wenn ich mir vorstelle was ist der mensch komme ich ins zweifeln

5094879 anthropologie bietet keine begr ndung f r menschenrechte normen sind aus dem menschenbild nicht ableitbar
5094880 gibt es das menschenbild oder nur heterogene menschenbilder menschenbilder bergen die gefahr des dogmatismus
5094881 ich habe kein pessimistisches aber auch kein optimistisches es gibt bestimmte situationen in denen der mensch b se sein muss
5094882 wir k nnen ja nicht ohne ethik auskommen wenn es nicht aus der anthropologie abgeleitet werden kann wie kann man es dann begr nden
5094883 wenn wir wissen was der mensch ist folgt daraus nicht was er tun soll ich kann nur sagen der mensch hat vernunft aus ist aussagen folgen keine soll aussagen das w re ein fehlschluss
5094884 ethische und juristische normen werden nicht in der menschlichen natur gefunden sie werden erfunden andere k nnen sagen die sind von gott vom himmel gefallen es sind positive setzungen von menschen geschaffen was menschenrechte sind erkannte man aus dem gegenteil ich finde sie eine hervorragende erfindung

5094889 weve found that octopuses effectively have six arms and two legs
5094890 observations showed that they use the rearmost two to get around over rocks and the seabed

5094921 no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempt to legalize ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to its knees and undermine our democratic system

5094950 a government cannot be premised on the belief that all persons are created equal when it asserts that god prefers some
5094951 the bible tells us to be like god and then on page after page it describes god as a mass murderer this may be the single most important key to the political behavior of western civilization
5094952 women should not be enlightened or educated in any way they should in fact be segregated as they are the cause of hideous and involuntary erections in holy men
5094953 ethical people will do what is right no matter what they are told religious people will do what they are told no matter what is right
5094954 the idea that god is an oversized white male with a flowing beard who sits in the sky and tallies the fall of every sparrow is ludicrous but if by god one means the set of physical laws that govern the universe then clearly there is such a god this god is emotionally unsatisfying it does not make much sense to pray to the law of gravity
5094955 power corrupts absolute power corrupts absolutely god is all powerful draw your own conclusions
5094956 we must question the story logic of having an all knowing all powerful god who creates faulty humans and then blames them for his own mistakes

5094966 muchos de esos compatriotas tiene la oportunidad de legalizarse y obtener un documento de identidad o licencia de conducir pero no lo pueden hacer por no poder obtener su pasaporte cuando lo requieren
5094967 en la actualidad obtener un pasaporte en un consulado en el exterior esta demorando de cuatro a seis meses para ello es necesario tener el dni cuya expedici n demora de tres a cinco meses esta demora en la emisi n de los pasaportes perjudica a muchos peruanos
5094968 el ministerio de relaciones exteriores tiene varios planes pilotos para expedir los pasaportes en tiempo real y uno similar para los dni sin embargo carece de las partidas necesarias para poder implementarlas

5094982 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5094983 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5094984 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5094985 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5094995 were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5094996 the greatest part is we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle
5094997 hes just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us thats what we have to keep doing is to try and win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground
5094998 he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5094999 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5095000 what were doing here is a little bit of practising for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car carl edwards did a great job the pit crew did a great job
5095001 it just came down to when he beat us off of pit road
5095002 that was it for us we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys we were good on that one run that one set of tires but that was pretty much what we had
5095003 we just didnt have enough for the no 99 there at the end we werent able to get through the corners as fast as carl was
5095004 we were a nine out of a 10 it seems like and those other guys were a 10 out of a 10
5095005 just to gamble a little bit on staying on track we knew at worst that we would still finish in the top five it was something to take a shot we certainly learned from it if we had to do it all over again wed probably still do it again
5095006 there was an innocence and an excitement to the shows of this era that can never be replicated its like the first season of the real world it was genuinely interesting because no one knew what was going to happen the participants of every subsequent season and every reality show that followed knew they could get famous from it so it became fake everyone knows that there is money or a hollywood deal to be made on the web now so theres no sense of danger the thrill is gone replaced by a careful eye on playcounts cpms and creating a brand

5095030 as a commodity exporting nation australia is highly dependent on both the outlook for global growth and commodity prices
5095031 the data gave the us dollar some support but i think people are starting to worry that maybe we will see a little bit of a breather in the us dollar rally
5095032 there have been a mixed bag of factors going on affecting the australian dollar but i do think it is really in a consolidation phase and it will wait for the rba minutes for direction
5095033 people and news media tend to focus on what is considered to be controversial rather than focus on the issues that are relevant to a lot of the countries in the region
5095034 a singular focus is not good for anybody and certainly not good for the people that we are trying to be responsible for
5095035 these couples are mainly from poor communities and could not afford the big costs of a normal wedding
5095036 she takes me to hospital and to see the doctor it would be impossible for me to get to these places if she didnt take me and i really appreciate that
5095037 i go to the gym for a couple of hours once a week
5095038 theres usually a group of about 20 elderly people there so i find that quite sociable
5095039 this is the first wave of men coming out of the divorce generation
5095040 some of these men have experienced a family breakdown or were not given custody rights after a divorce
5095041 as a result weve found that many enter the later stages in life with difficult family relationships or weaker ties with their children
5095042 men tend to have weaker social links and contact with family and friends
5095043 less comfortable with planning social interactions and knowing how to integrate themselves fully into society
5095044 many older people experience loneliness but men over the age of 80 who live alone as well as those who are recently bereaved are particularly at risk
5095045 i never did much around the house mainly a bit of hoovering and washing the car it was quite a challenge at first but i can do it all now
5095046 my wife who had to go out to work because we didnt have much money did all the washing cooking and cleaning as well like all blokes do i took that for granted only now do i appreciate the work she did
5095047 but im always glad when they have time for a chat
5095048 but now and then i do think wouldnt it be nice to walk into the kitchen and have a nice cup of tea waiting for me but no if i want one ill have to get it myself
5095049 there are two different eras of sport in t amp t whereas in the past sport was simply a means of taking a sweat it is now a means of nation building regional integration and getting ahead
5095050 elitism must begin at the bottom up you can pump how much money you want into it sport at the end but you will always fail
5095051 i can assure you that before my career is over we will start winning again
5095052 if you dont fall hard enough you dont reach to the next level
5095053 you cant take anything lightly everyones fighting for places and everyones fighting to get ready to go
5095054 by the very nature of that it will be a proper game
5095055 what i know about scotland is that when they played against sussex they were always massively up for the game so you have to be up for the game as well
5095056 were trying to set trends for how we go about our cricket kevin pietersen has said he wants everybody up for it every time they play a game for england so that will be no different on monday
5095057 hes done it for 14 months so its not a flash in the pan
5095058 hes gone away to have treatment and physical work and get himself ready to play again were hoping he comes back into the one day series feeling refreshed and ready to go
5095059 you can get into your head that its only the associate countries
5095060 there are a lot of county cricketers and ex pros who play there are a lot of experienced cricketers
5095061 one thing that sticks out for me is the hunger and the intensity
5095062 county cricket can sometimes be the same thing every day here everyone wants to win they have aims
5095063 for me its a very good level and there are things i can learn and take back to england and the county championship with warwickshire
5095064 whoever you are you want to be playing test cricket and to do that you have to be playing for england
5095065 ill be sitting there wanting to beat them but at the same time thinking in a few years i want to be there
5095066 obviously you still love your roots but you want to be playing international cricket earning the money whatever motivates the person
5095067 but you want to be on the other side youre still proud of playing for scotland but theres a bigger picture
5095068 we believe this squad is very capable of doing justice to its selection to the stanford superstars squad to face england for the unprecedented purse of us 20million
5095069 there are several familiar faces in this stanford superstars squad but there are some exciting new additions such as lindon james lionel baker and chad hampson and this was due to the fact that there were some high quality performances from these individuals in the stanford 20 20 tournaments and they were also very impressive in the just concluded stanford superstars camp
5095070 destiny is not a matter of chance it is a matter of choice it

5095075 this place has to be pretty damn good because i ended up finishing both slices
5095076 where exactly did the taste go did someone steal it or did it just pack its bags and disappear
5095077 if you cant make a good margherita you have no bitnitz being in bitnitz
5095078 this trendy cafe is hidden in a super industrial neighborhood without the typical hustle bustle in the city
5095079 the food was great i especially like the handmade pasta it is thick and chewy
5095080 i know some people turn their nose down a bit at the prospect that people could save 10 or so on a tank of petrol but we dont he told abc tv
5095081 we think its a very important part of having a more competitive petrol market and we intend to fight for it in the senate
5095082 well we do so we are going to get up there and fight for this measure
5095083 its an important measure and we think its important because it can help people save a small amount of money admittedly from time to time
5095084 but thats important to a lot of people who are under financial pressure
5095085 jumped the gun in supporting moves to introduce fuelwatch to south australia four years ago
5095086 but then i set up a parliamentary inquiry he told channel 9
5095087 i was part of that inquiry process and it became quite clear that if you want to tackle the whole issue of fuel prices effectively the best way to do that is to tackle the issue of competition amongst the big four oil companies
5095088 what horse trading implies is that youll support something you dont believe in in order to get something else through
5095089 the problem with horse trading is sometimes youll end up with a donkey or even worse a trojan horse so i need to decide things on their merit and issues have to be taken on their merits
5095090 i cant in good conscience support a law that i just dont agree with
5095091 these couples are mainly from poor communities and could not afford the big costs of a normal wedding
5095092 and so how does this concern me i am not playing any sort of game in fact i have taken time from instructing my employees and dealing with clients and speaking to my latest beau just to read your rubbish ordinal this had best be good
5095093 the smallest minds and the selfishest souls and the cowardliest hearts that god makes
5095094 im not sure what happened either my leg cramped or i was protecting it but i felt i couldnt use my leg any more
5095095 it felt like someone was stepping on it but when i turned round there was nobody there it was the same leg as the fracture but it wasnt a sharp pain more a tightening up
5095096 i was trying to achieve the impossible because the amount of running i had done wasnt enough and you cant take short cuts in the marathon
5095097 its not the end well keep fingers crossed for 2012 maybe the olympics wont happen for me but how hold is constantina 38
5095098 maybe my body will hold out i know in london i will have all that support
5095099 i dont know what to feel so many emotions so much excitement i just want to see my mum
5095100 its been nothing but an upwards rollercoaster but its been nothing but fun
5095101 the biggest thing is nothing is impossible with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination
5095102 i wanted to put my mind to it and wanted to do something that no one ever did in sport
5095103 this means a lot to my country it means a lot to me
5095104 the first thing i thought of doing was to give all the nutritional supplements i have consumed my vitamins for testing
5095105 unfortunately the olympic spirit is not being respected at all by chinese officials in tibet
5095106 civilians are often arrested violently tortured to the point where they die its really very very sad
5095107 it was a bit like new york city suddenly coming online overnight
5095108 someone lifted a curtain and there was this gleaming city full of people who wanted to spend money on wine
5095109 i came over in march which was just just after the duty cut and thought well heres an opportunity lets do it now
5095110 i would actually argue that hong kong is already the wine trading centre for asia up to 23 percent of all wine sold at auction internationally is sold to hong kong buyers but the effect of the duty cut has been dramatic
5095111 within the first three or four days we had 10 container loads of rare and fine wine confirmed to be shipped over we had prepared by opening a second facility and are currently opening our third to cater for wines coming in
5095112 hong kong just adds an extra stop youre still going to have to go into china and deal with all the bureaucracy
5095113 thats fine if youre importing 200 cases of standard wine but not if its six bottles of 96 lafite
5095114 the net result is the fine wine market in mainland china is not going to develop at all apart from consumption
5095115 theyre huge buyers of classified growth of the latours and the lafites but theyre not saving it
5095116 that markets all about showing off going out with your friends and saying look ive got an 82 latour here lets drink it
5095117 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5095118 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5095119 no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempt to legalize ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to its knees and undermine our democratic system
5095120 georgia is a sovereign state and the territorial integrity of the state must be provided for
5095121 i wish peace for my country and for our children we do not want to live in fear
5095122 i thought there might be chinese fireworks or chinese food but its really lacking
5095123 it the chinese government has failed by acting in this way it has shown the world this is a country that does not respect human rights
5095124 ive had a wonderful trip this week i started off by having a chance to go to the olympic games opening ceremony and see a lot of those games which were fantastically managed
5095125 it was a surprise for me where was all the pollution i have read about in the newspapers
5095126 its a situation that i am not totally comfortable with playing seven matches in eight days but i guess it is something we will have to live with i will ask for a lot from the girls and i hope they can give a good account of themselves
5095127 on paper we are third best but that doesnt say that we cant come out on top all you girls need to do is stay focused work as a team and remain disciplined
5095128 i am amazed that four players and the manager of the team are still in barbados and yet still we were asked to play a match one day before the scheduled start of the tournament
5095129 it sounds like a lot of runs in baseball but in cricket you have these big scores
5095130 we have permission from the city to play here and each of the teams makes a volunteer donation
5095131 team sports like cricket should not be included in the olympics olympics is a personal game where sportsman tries to excel within himself
5095132 it would be unfair to include cricket in the olympics as the players of other sports especially of individual events wait for the single day to happen and show their talents
5095133 seek to be in my will and in the place i have prepared for you and all your needs will be provided for

5095136 the thin and precarious crust of decency is all that separates any civilization however impressive from the hell of anarchy or systematic tyranny which lie in wait beneath the surface
5095137 it is said that the sea is the most unforgiving of creatures
5095138 it is because of this that you will find crew of vessels who prefer the emptiness of the oceans to the chaos of the lives on land
5095139 no ships captain is born in the ocean but thats where they live because no philosopher has discovered any more truth than a sailor on the open ocean
5095140 of course i would like to think that when ships sink into the ocean they dont fall to the depths where they curse the sea floor with their ghostly carcases
5095141 and when a ship sinks it falls into the blue suspended in the timeless deep

5095153 as a commodity exporting nation australia is highly dependent on both the outlook for global growth and commodity prices ms hampton said from wellington
5095154 the data gave the us dollar some support but i think people are starting to worry that maybe we will see a little bit of a breather in the us dollar rally ms hampton said
5095155 there have been a mixed bag of factors going on affecting the australian dollar but i do think it is really in a consolidation phase and it will wait for the rba minutes for direction ms hampton said
5095156 on the evening of july 25th 1914 a meeting of the general staff took place at which it was decided to declare at once a preparatory mobilization period and further to declare a state of war over all fortresses and frontier stations war was already decided on and the whole flood of telegrams between the governments of russia and germany represented mere the stage setting mis en scene of an historical drama
5095157 at seven in the evening july 25th i went to the warsaw station to bid farewell to isvolsky who was leaving to rejoin his station great activity at the terminus the trains crowded with officers and troops all this points to mobilization we hurriedly exchanged our views of the situation and both arrive at the same conclusion this time it is war
5095158 on july 25 in company with several serbian officers i arrived at warsaw from berlin as far as the german frontier not the slightest indications were seen of military measures but immediately after crossing the german frontier into russian poland we noticed mobilization steps being taken on a grand scale assembly of freight cars in all the stations military occupation of the railway stations massing of troops in several cities transport of troops at night mobilization signalling when we arrived at brest litovsk july 25th the state of siege had already been proclaimed
5095159 berlin has tried to mediate between petersburg and vienna on the appeal of the czar but his majesty silently had already mobilized before the appeal so that the mediator germany is placed en demeure and his work becomes illusory

5095165 ive been coming down here since the 60s two or three times a week

5095167 to be honest id say greyhound racing is dying everywhere
5095168 i used to work with a trainer in sydney and when i went back to australia recently there was only a tiny crowd there too its very sad
5095169 its a real shame to see it go as it means so much to the area
5095170 even though i havent lived in the east end for many years i have great memories of walthamstow and i know many people will miss it including me
5095171 he was a quiet lad i used to lock him in the lift for a laugh
5095172 im getting really quite emotional about the track but they wont be able to save it its gone i think in a years time itll all be houses and flats here
5095173 im a window fitter so my only hope now is that i get the contract to fit out the houses
5095174 we are incredibly proud to be able to work with sustainability in this way
5095175 when we go overseas now a dollar denominated price is something much more competitive if you are competing against companies that are selling in euros for instance
5095176 so there is an advantage as we set up and try to get product into europe or southeast asia
5095177 weve always wanted to be the best environmental citizen we could be
5095178 where we can be leaders is in the social space and now more and more of our peer organizations are thinking about this it gives nau a whole other social responsibility venture

5095181 i was really interested in the surprising and unimaginable forms in the deep sea and used that idea to create my pieces the garments mimic some of the elements of swaying coral and hiding fish or fish changing to frighten predators

5095207 i am not sure how much longer i will play for it depends on whether i get a new contract
5095208 i am getting onto the level four coaching course this winter i am coming to the end of my career so we will just see what happens
5095209 i am not a big strong hitter of the ball so i have to find other ways of manipulating it
5095210 it is a big part of my game to rotate the strike and run as hard as i can so hitting a few boundary balls was a bonus
5095211 as i got in i thought that if i stayed until the end we would have a good chance of winning
5095212 all the build up you turn up and bat like that
5095213 so far it hasnt been a distraction because its been through a process
5095214 the idea for us is to try and get it cleared up
5095215 its a chance to listen to haroon lorgat about what the situation is so all the players are fully informed knowing that the board are then going to meet on tuesday and make a decision on whether were going or not

5095273 you shall not be afraid of the terrors of the night nor of the arrow the evil plots and slanders of the wicked that flies by day nor of the pestilence that stalks in darkness nor of the destruction and sudden death that surprise and lay waste at noonday

5095276 for i know whom i have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which ive committed unto him against that day

5095285 you cant preach the gospel to a man with toothache
5095286 hypocrisy is the gap between your aspirations and your actions greens have high aspirations they want to live more ethically and they will always fall short but the alternative to hypocrisy isnt moral purity no one manages that but cynicism

5095318 honey you do realize that we are n ot doing it tonight right
5095319 its pretty bad when 28 five year olds wear you out and i dont even get a chance
5095320 delighted to see that tom harris mp has made a return to blogging
5095321 personally i dont see how that is any of your business or anyone elses for that matter
5095322 im done with you and your tude im going to be in the office doing paperwork go home and get laid or something just stop being a bitch bitch
5095323 i had a few interviews today now im in for some discounted lunch but were not talking about me what about you and jason
5095324 i never in a million years thought that being jasons sponsor was going to be so taxing on both of us i broke up with him due to his drinking problem so i guess he thinks that if i think hes stopped drinking that i will go running back into his arms or something
5095325 you need to come clean with him you are indeed pushing him into a deeper and darker realm of alcoholism you need to tell him straight up that it is over between you two and set the relationship boundaries or he will die from this debilitating mental disease
5095326 will he kill himself it sounds to me like hes just being a little child vying for your utmost attention most suicidal tendencies are listen im gonna be frank here and i hope this doesnt hinder our friendship but i think you need to hear this
5095327 when you took on the responsibility of making sure he stopped drinking usually the best sponsor is a third party observer like a pastor or therapist or a close family member or friend not the person you went into rehab for think about it the less progress he sees with you two the less progress he will make with his quitting drinking in your case you acted as the instigator
5095328 its not your fault you thought you were helping out a friend but and this is my professional opinion helping out your friend this time will be not being there for him
5095329 do you want to grab a coffee after i get out of work
5095330 well after coffee he walked me back to my car and we set a date for wednesday night no im no longer going to go with jason to his a a meetings because im being the instigator its complicated mom ill explain it to you later of course he needs to find a new sponsor sooner than later tonight right after i hang up with you in fact but seriously mom im super excited about charles i think he and i have a connection well ill keep you posted i know mom clock is ticking even though im only 26 what does that mean your clock whatever mom listen i gotta go ill talk to you later ok love you too bye
5095331 ohhhh thats always the solution to your problems isnt it blame it all on jasons drinking problem
5095332 did you ever stop and think that maybe you have a problem bitch like a dick sucking problem

5095334 i dont know him youre new fuck toy that guy you work with
5095335 thats my own personal business which has nothing to do with you and besides how do you know about him

5095337 i am not going to do this any more i am not helping you any more because you are not helping yourself the a a meetings the breakdowns the butting into my personal life
5095338 its over between us its been over between us from now on it will only be us as friends and nothing more

5095369 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5095370 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5095371 no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempt to legalize ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to its knees and undermine our democratic system
5095372 georgia is a sovereign state and the territorial integrity of the state must be provided for

5095379 said foster who bounced back from a horrific diving accident 10 years ago to become an olympian
5095380 thats true whether you win a gold medal or whether you get eighth place
5095381 just coming to the olympic games has been a great experience and theres so much i can take away from this
5095382 first round i was a little scared i was tense
5095383 tonight i felt great i went all out i gave it everything i had it didnt happen quite the way i wouldve liked it to but i have no regrets
5095384 i was like oh my gosh im in the finals at the olympic games
5095385 in rome i mean that would be a great place to visit
5095386 a full investigation will be carried out and our sympathies are with the families of the killed and injured civilians at this time
5095387 the patrol identified insurgents with weapons on the roof of the compound preparing to attack and in order to protect themselves launched three rockets all of which hit the target
5095388 unbeknown to the patrol the civilians were inside the compound at the time the casualties were treated at a nearby isaf medical facility where two of them children remain seriously ill
5095389 isaf deeply regrets the tragedy of this incident when women and children were killed and injured as a result of an imminent insurgent attack from a position where they would have known women and children were present
5095390 a young art curator finding herself aggressively pursued by a band of wannabe lovers after she steals coins from a roman fountain
5095391 president medvedev agreed but we cannot postpone and we cannot delay with these tasks
5095392 assured that georgians will not continue to use military force
5095393 if i would ask you in response to the same question how fast the american forces can leave iraq for example the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5095394 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5095395 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5095396 i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not
5095397 however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5095398 along comes mccain who not only has he doesnt like to talk about his religion very much and then he talks about it openly but he has a very powerful story thats emotionally connected to the audience
5095399 its the candidate who can connect emotionally to middle america who will have the big advantage going down the stretch
5095400 it was far less about religion and a lot more about values
5095401 on this particular issue if you believe that life begins at conception and you are consistent then i cant argue with you on that
5095402 what i can do is say are there ways we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies
5095403 for me as a christian it is a sacred union gods in the mix
5095404 i can afford those civil rights to others even if i dont have that view
5095405 i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5095406 john mccains going to be a much tougher opponent for barack obama in the debates than anybody ever might have imagined just a few weeks ago
5095407 for a minute there we were just two christians worshipping together
5095408 hes a man of few words but when he tells stories he connects
5095409 i thought barack obamas answer tonight was helpful to him and addressed a couple of things because theres been a lot of doubt about his christian faith
5095410 i think he also helped to dispel the myth that hes such an elitist and hes arrogant he was quite humble in that answer and many others
5095411 i dont think he was a strong enough jurist or a legal thinker at the time for that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation
5095412 those are the judges that the evangelicals that social conservative voters want to hear from john mccains own lips that he opposes and that he would not support because the issue of judges is perhaps one of the most if not the most important issue for many social conservatives
5095413 the voters out there who went out in large numbers for george w bush that is one of the things that they want to hear from john mccain because that is something that gives them a lot more faith in john mccain
5095414 i am just waiting to hold them in my arms and breast feed them
5095415 i dont know if i can do it to all but i will try
5095416 they are doing well but they still need a lot of care
5095417 what they need most is a dwelling to live in i hope the government will give them an apartment
5095418 with the help of allah they will make it but i think it will be difficult
5095419 one of the great lies about american politics is that democrats genuinely subscribe to a set of core convictions that make democrats different from republicans and the same thing of course applies to the other party its not true i happen to define myself as a conservative well what do conservatives say they stand for well conservatives say they stand for balanced budgets small government the so called traditional values well when you look back over the past 30 or so years since the rise of ronald reagan which we in many respects has been a conservative era in american politics well did we get small government do we get balanced budgets do we get serious as opposed to simply rhetorical attention to traditional social values the answers no because all of that really has simply been part of a package of tactics that republicans have employed to get elected and to and then to stay in office

5095433 one of my favorite people of all time is ms ellen degeneres
5095434 so i wish all the best all the happiness all the joy that comes with that certificate just the joy of being able to stand up and say that in front of everyone you love and care about in front of each other and to walk away legal is huge
5095435 i love ellen degeneres i watch her show all the time
5095436 i just want to say congratulations and i am really sorry you didnt invite me to your wedding
5095437 dude i just met you and you may be my friends best friend but youre a selfish asshole
5095438 any notion that russia was the kind of responsible state ready to integrate into international institutions
5095439 i think that there has been an effort by three successive american presidents to try and coax russia into an integrated role in the international community
5095440 we thought that they were headed in that direction we now have to reevaluate all that
5095441 it wants to be part of these institutions that are so essential to the international economy and the international order
5095442 it wants to engage in kind of soviet style behavior of intimidating and invading allies or neighbors
5095443 what the president has done is to open a path for russia that would have been different than the path of the soviet union
5095444 russia that has misjudged what would happen if it did not take that path
5095445 it has nothing to do obviously with the conflict that began in south ossetia
5095446 i think that the whole world is looking at russia through a different set of lenses the longer they take to get out and to observe the cease fire thats been declared and the arrangements that have been worked out i think the greater those consequences will be
5095447 russia has given continuous promises to hold to the ceasefire but in fact they are continuing their actions they are widening their zone of occupation
5095448 sooner or later yes but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave
5095449 began to ring like a political campaign instead of principled and strong diplomacy
5095450 presumptuous is to try to undercut in any way the very difficult and tricky work that president bush and secretary rice are trying to do right now
5095451 he called for an international peacekeeping force he called for humanitarian aid he called it exactly what it is unprovoked aggression
5095452 if we were georgians and the russians were invading our country and killing our people wed bet in a state of war
5095453 john sometimes is given to this kind of bellicose rhetoric which has a tendency to inflame conflicts rather than to diffuse them
5095454 senator obama to this day to this day denies the value and the strategic benefit of the surge
5095455 because the bush mccain approach has been to focus almost exclusively on iraq over the last five years a lot of these issues have gone without the kind of attention they deserve
5095456 we thought that the russians were headed in the direction of an integrated role in the international community we now have to reevaluate all that
5095457 do not lie do not participate in a lie do not support a lie
5095458 theres a real concern that russia has turned a corner here and is headed back to its past rather than its future
5095459 stick the long and hard one up the collective keisters of little bush amp co
5095460 hmmm now where can i find an affordable place to open another nice southern style restaurant where in this great borough is the population most suffering from a lack of comfort food where do they not have so much as one non fast food kitchen that allows its patrons to sit and enjoy their food who most needs the love
5095461 flatbush could it be flatbush let me do some research lets see the word on the street is that in flatbush there are huge hords of comfort deprived folks who must eat their food standing up hmmm are commercial rents reasonable check whats this the biggest culinary promise east of the q train is is applebees oh no i have to get down there to rent a place this is an emergency the residents of flatbush need me comfort food to the rescue

5095479 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
5095480 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
5095481 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
5095482 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
5095483 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
5095484 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government

5095490 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
5095491 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
5095492 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
5095493 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
5095494 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
5095495 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
5095496 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american

5095521 after giving hillary clinton a speaking role on tuesday night and bill clinton a speaking role on wednesday night now hillary clintons going to get her name placed in nomination and to have a roll call question is that the way president obama would negotiate to just keep caving in
5095522 obama has agreed and from what im told from people in the obama camp this wasnt something they were happy about claire mccaskill to the contrary not withstanding to have hillary clintons name placed in nomination and to have a roll call vote smart politics or a show of weakness

5095599 you know it seemed i would make a birdie and then id make a bogey
5095600 i couldnt really get on a momentum at all this week
5095601 but i feel that im encouraged by what im seeing on the golf course and im going to take all the fan support i had this week and take it to the next tournament ill be getting myself in the winners circle soon
5095602 making that put on the last hole in front of the hometown crowd was amazing
5095603 i probably threw it a little harder than i should have
5095604 its a hard week playing as a canadian at the canadian open
5095605 its so nice to have everybody pulling for you you feel like you disappoint them a little bit but im just very happy that the tournament is done and i finished it the way i did
5095606 im pretty happy i was pretty nervous coming up here
5095607 i felt pressure and i was nervous but i felt like i handled it well
5095608 it helps to play the same course as all these great players its been pretty neat to be around all the crowds
5095609 i kept hitting into the rough and when you do that its tough to get on track
5095610 once youre on the bogey train its hard to get off
5095611 sangyay lingba compl te cette proph tie au xvi si cle
5095612 i feel like i gained a lot of confidence in myself again this year
5095613 being pain free in the later part of the year i started feeling confident from may on its getting better and better and now in the off season i know what to work on for next year
5095614 nothing would make me happier or prouder than to win the cn canadian open
5095615 and priddis next year in calgary that golf course sets my eye already
5095616 i struggle to play my best golf when theres no pressure
5095617 the next level for me is about accepting im a three time major winner taking the confidence from that and that will help me earlier in tournaments so i dont have to put myself through the mill
5095618 ive got a deep down confidence that i can battle through anything
5095619 i need to have more flamboyant confidence at the start
5095620 obviously ive been the no 1 european player for six years it is interesting that it has taken these major wins to get that across
5095621 theres no doubt ill always make myself available to help anybody else but in that sense winning a couple of majors may make people seek advice from me during that week
5095622 its such a high in my career it very easily could be the last high and many players have failed at this point in the past
5095623 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5095624 this is unbelievable were winning races were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5095625 ten points is 10 points the beauty of it is keeping kyle from getting 10 points hes so fast you cant give him any room
5095626 what were doing here is a little bit of practicing for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car carl edwards did a great job the pit crew did a great job
5095627 it just came down to when he beat us off of pit road
5095628 that was it for us we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys we were good on that one run that one set of tires but that was pretty much what we had
5095629 we just didnt have enough for the no 99 there at the end we werent able to get through the corners as fast as carl was
5095630 carls right there he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5095631 we were a nine out of a 10 it seems like and those other guys were a 10 out of a 10
5095632 just to gamble a little bit on staying on track we knew at worst that we would still finish in the top five it was something to take a shot we certainly learned from it if we had to do it all over again wed probably still do it again
5095633 to have your number retired its one of the greatest things that could ever happen to you
5095634 i knew the significance of it so i was nervous i havent been this nervous in a long time
5095635 i played the game i dearly loved to play since i was a kid
5095636 they gave me a number and now its hanging from the rafters

5095684 until we screened in palestine it didnt feel like we were finished yet
5095685 over 4000 people came out to nablus to see the show i couldnt get the gaza rappers out for the screening and i couldnt get into gaza myself the shows in ramallah and jenin were awesome
5095686 i was in gaza in 2003 for the first hip hop show there ever we just decided to make a movie
5095687 i didnt know anything about filmmaking and there were lots of production problems i didnt even bother reading the manual before i picked up the camera we were working on graphics and the sound right up to sundance
5095688 but basically i paid for the film on my credit cards
5095689 even in the production i left cameras with dam and abeer and pr i wanted the film to speak with their voices as much as possible
5095690 they did start getting impatient after a couple of years it was hard to convince them that taking a bit of extra time would make it that much better
5095691 but they were very loyal to me plenty of other filmmakers approached them in those years but they told them no jackie will make the first movie they even turned down al jazeera thats a big sacrifice
5095692 what really changed dams music was the second intifada thats when they released meen irhabi the intifada made the zionist rapper worse he sings death to arabs you never hear palestinian rappers singing death to jews
5095693 i have so much respect for their integrity coca cola is a big player in israel and they approached dam about doing an ad for them they offered them a lot of money but the guys told them no you hear about that and you realize these guys really have principals even though theyre broke
5095694 the hip hop is different in different parts of palestine in gaza its harder to have shows because its more religious even though all the rappers believe in god yet it took off there more than anywhere else
5095695 taking images and placing them next to each other and setting them to music that all comes pretty naturally to me when i heard sundance wanted to screen it and i had no idea what it meant
5095696 people have told me that slingshot is the first palestine film theyve seen that doesnt make them depressed
5095697 were all on the left here so youre just preaching to the choir

5095700 a woman walked into an exhibition that had one of my gumball machines
5095701 she put in a quarter and one of my rings dropped out she came back with a roll of quarters and kept feeding them in one after the other
5095702 i asked her what are you doing i was a little irritated i guess because a lot of time and energy goes into each one of those items she told me i just liked to collect rings
5095703 i dont think my work is going to change the world that people will want to overthrow israel after seeing my film but if im going to work it has to be meaningful with slingshot i also want to help the artists
5095704 one of the problems palestinians face is how theyre represented in the media that means we have to make different media media is our strongest weapon i think

5095707 it took a lot of courage for shaun to tell the employees of sparks that we arent going to give them a raise this year
5095708 i knew that hurt him a lot because we have great staff he loves our staff and works well with them
5095709 his contract is not up until next summer and thats when i would like to take a look at it
5095710 between now and summer well have to sit down and talk about a new contract

5095713 im the chairman of the truckee meadows water authority and neither the mayor nor our city manager sat me down and briefed me on what was planned
5095714 if there is somebody to be at blame for what happened with tmwa and the way that thing went down it should be myself
5095715 the city of reno mainly mayor bob cashell approached me about this to talk about it
5095716 i talked with shaun to set up some meetings so we could discuss this shaun really wasnt keen on the idea but because of my suggestion we proceeded with it
5095717 if anyone is to blame for the thing that happened with tmwa and that going south it should be me and not shaun
5095718 i just felt that i didnt care to look at extending his contract another year until the next year 2009
5095719 we havent seen eye to eye throughout the year on some issues but i want to give my public commitment to be able to work hand in hand with you this next year to make sure that our communication level increases

5096031 for the past two years crude has followed the dollar almost lock step
5096032 the strength weve seen in the dollar is almost certainly helping bring crude down at this point as you move backward it actually acts as a stimulus on the economy
5096033 as for housing starts i think everyone is expecting them to remain soft ppi wont be much of a market mover as commodities have been moving lower which makes last months numbers irrelevant
5096034 i dont think were out of the woods yet on financials because i dont think were out of the woods on housing

5096039 you set that bar so high for so long that when you do lose everbodys like what just happened even for us were like what the hells going on but in reality thats just baseball wed been riding that wave for so long were going to get back on and soon
5096040 that hurts when your middle guys cant get nothing going
5096041 their pitchers did a good job cliff lee pitched a gem friday fausto carmona saturdays starter is tough on righties were like sacrificial lambs against him i dont know what happened today jeremy sowers pitched well
5096042 we didnt swing the bats well at all this series we were fortunate to come out with a win
5096043 its not very often youre going to see the middle of our lineup controlled like that but they did it this series
5096044 i was playing over to left center and he hit it to right center so i had a long run i thought i had a shot i felt like i had my glove on it then when i hit the wall it shot out of my glove

5096048 el principal escollo que nos impide continuar al frente de aerol neas es la actual conducci n sindical de los pilotos hasta que dichas personas no sean reveladas por otras m s afines a la empresa el problema no tiene salida

5096056 some children particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds do not experience risks in such positive challenging or exciting ways for them risk taking can refer to threats to their safety including the threat of violence
5096057 risk taking can also refer to young people experimenting with drugs and alcohol public parks are sometimes the sites where this activity takes place
5096058 the ambiguity which results from this could lead to misinterpretation and misunderstanding particularly given recent reports and media concerns about cotton wool kids
5096059 its government talk for we have to be seen to make sure this happens
5096060 some questions might be raised about finding space for this in central london boroughs for instance it might be difficult but that is very much a council by council issue

5096067 lampard is not brazilian hes english but he touched the ball very well it was his style the same with ballack we have a style its impossible to say to deco foul people thats not his style
5096068 i only give the players the freedom to play and allow them to express their style this is a chelsea performance not a scolari performance
5096069 hell have an examination on monday after this if we have a problem with ballack well discuss with the german federation about his situation
5096070 manchester united will not be scared they are not our opponents next week maybe wigan will be
5096071 they were just too bright their movement was too much and we couldnt stay with them
5096072 hopefully what were going to bring at brand design is a seamless experience there are lots of digital companies that do customer up communication and a lot of branding agencies that do brand down communication which results in a 400 page book sitting on somebodys desk that youve got to follow what were trying to do now is form an idea and an expression of an idea in one place

5096084 the world is as round as a football we all live on this football climate change does not need a visa it travels freely when we play with the football it will deflate anyway but we can give it air again but if we ignore the ball while he is lying in the corner it will shrink totally
5096085 yes the north is doing efforts but if you look at the kind of funds they invest in you know that their priority is reducing greenhouse gas emissions quotas per capita often by buying clean air abroad and only a small percentage of their budget goes towards investment in adaptation incentives and innovative technologies
5096086 it is all very nice that european countries are showing off their willingness to give 0 7 of their gdp to development but the truth is that this percentage is based on information from the sixties back then the studies showed that 1 of the gdp of the wealthiest countries could help the development of the developing countries the consensus was that 30 of the investment had to come from private sources thus the other 70 would be provided by the governments we are now 2007 and only from 2012 on some of the countries will spend 0 70 of their gdp on development even though that percentage is not up to date anymore and is not taking into account new emerging economies such as china india and brazil

5096108 to continue achieving positive performance for shareholders and other stakeholders subject to business factors beyond its control
5096109 the increased cost of fuel has had a significant impact despite this and other cost pressures including the governments surprise increase to road user charges freightways continues to make decisions for the long term good of the business
5096110 which is a credit to the strength and flexibility of the freightways model and to the team who delivered this result
5096111 an emerging growth opportunity as evidenced by its recent acquisitions the groups information management businesses currently contribute around 15 of freightways annual revenue and earnings and are experiencing strong growth on both sides of the tasman
5096112 in recent years freightways has successfully embarked on diversifying its activities both geographically and deeper into the informational management market
5096113 we will continue to seek out and develop growth opportunities that complement our existing capabilities to support this strategy
5096114 just because a person has the right to free speech does not mean he is obligated to let every thought that wanders into his mind fall out of his mouth
5096115 why not give the pitchers only three balls instead of four
5096116 why not let the fielders tackle the runner if necessary but then give the base runner blockers that would be cool
5096117 the region of south ossetia was always remarkable for its unique monuments of history and culture now we can only remember that the residents of now destroyed tskhinvali used to have 2 museums a theatre and a library apart from this there were hundreds of unique archaeological and architectural monuments there some of them going back several centuries and now as a result of the georgian invasion everything is lost forever how cruel and cynical it was to destroy the cultural heritage and memory of a whole nation in a few days
5096118 this tournament generally helped us prepare for the fiba asia championships in terms of building the teams confidence and exposing the players to different opponents outside southeast asia

5096122 people and news media tend to focus on what is considered to be controversial rather than focus on the issues that are relevant to a lot of the countries in the region

5096142 it was supposed to come out at the same time in australia
5096143 but unfortunately whats the best way of putting it the people responsible for actually physically getting it into the shops didnt realise that australia was such a long way away and it might take a bit longer to get it it was the same in ireland as well theres so much stuff on the actual thing itself that to get it certificated and produced and whatever else just took a bit longer than was anticipated i e seven months
5096144 it meant that i got to the point where i was comfortable enough on stage going on and actually genuinely talking and genuinely being funny without relying on jokes
5096145 that was the hardest thing about the whole process just going well hang on when is the best time to catch it so basically i didnt the release is actually a two disc set there are two shows filmed three months apart
5096146 where they do shakespeare and its all a bit la di da
5096147 theyre two different shows but they were basically recorded at the same time
5096148 well ones indoors and ones outdoors thats the main one
5096149 its got no roof on it and all the rest of it
5096150 just cause of the nature of being outside theres a ton of stuff about picnics and cheese and theres a bit about a fight that kicked off on a moped just up the road from where the gig was it was the sort of thing where everyone was going well this is a bit weird were watching a stand up show but were essentially in a park
5096151 is a bit darker its a bit more about whats going on in my head than whats going on in the room

5096180 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5096181 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5096182 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5096183 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5096235 people and news media tend to focus on what is considered to be controversial rather than focus on the issues that are relevant to a lot of the countries in the region
5096236 a singular focus is not good for anybody and certainly not good for the people that we are trying to be responsible for
5096237 as more and more information is collected and kept on all of us we are very concerned that appropriate safeguards go along with that
5096238 people should know what is happening with their information and have a choice
5096239 our concern is that what is kept with the justification of preventing and detecting terrorism can then be used for minor purposes such as pursuing people for parking fines

5096272 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

5096332 hes clearly a deserving champion and a very worthy champion courier said of cash
5096333 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop robin pemberton vice president of competition for nascar said sunday
5096334 it was magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 percent wide open
5096335 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5096336 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet pemberton said when asked if the penalties were likely to be severe
5096337 we historically dont make our decisions within a 24 hour period it takes time to get everybody in a group and talk about it
5096338 let me just say that first and foremost that that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys there at jgr gibbs said
5096339 i want to apologize to nascar to our partners to toyota guys a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5096340 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were gibbs said
5096341 for us we kind of feel like in the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and chief engine builder mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5096342 the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped to come back and win it again thats awesome gibbs noted
5096343 thats a great story that wasnt able to be told
5096344 well figure out exactly what happened and those that were responsible gibbs said
5096345 theres going to be punishment for that thats just part of life you cant do that
5096346 if this alleged incident proves true it goes against everything we stand for as an organization the former washington redskins coach said
5096347 we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us
5096348 i found out about it halfway through the day session last night when i went over there to see what was going on white said
5096349 i was surprised to see what was happening and astonished and frankly incredulous i couldnt believe it was happening because its clearly defined in the entry forms that you dont do this sort of thing
5096350 but im sure joe and j d will take care of that internally and whatever fans think theyre going to think were just going to keep working on our stuff
5096351 its not something that you like to hear about and you have to just question every chassis dyno thats ever been run on every toyota suhy said
5096352 you look at the no 32 car of brian vickers and red bull racing the 32 and the 18 and the 20 made about the same power the first run on the dyno when they took the magnet or whatever this device was out of the 18 and the 20 they both came up
5096353 what i dont know is if its a toyota problem if its a joe gibbs thing how widespread is it and how long has it been going on because a lot of whats been done by nascar has been based on the chassis dyno results
5096354 its disappointing to hear that anybody whether its a manufacturer or a team or an individual on a team would go to any length to do that suhy added
5096355 if theyre going to make decisions based on parity after theyve given toyota what theyve given them with regard to parameters on their engine based on flawed data that a team or the manufacturer one of the other had kited or shaved that certainly is detrimental to my interests
5096356 were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5096357 the greatest part is we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle
5096358 hes just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us thats what we have to keep doing is to try and win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground
5096359 he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5096360 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5096361 what were doing here is a little bit of practicing for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car carl edwards did a great job the pit crew did a great job
5096362 it just came down to when he beat us off of pit road
5096363 were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for

5096373 yes many prominent greens are posh gits like me the same can be said of journalists politicians artists academics business leaders in fact of just about anyone in public life but it is always the greens who are singled out

5096414 ich wollte ihn f r immer halten damit alle die ihn kannten kommen und um ihn trauern k nnen
5096415 ich ging aus dem haus um den soldaten brot zu bringen mein bruder seine frau und ihr sohn blieben zu hause
5096416 als ich bei den soldaten stand h rte ich die russischen flugzeuge
5096417 wir warfen uns alle in deckung dann fielen die bomben die erde bebte wir sind eine gl ubige familie ich habe gebetet
5096418 als sie weg waren stand ich auf und sah schwarzen rauch beim haus meines bruders aufsteigen

5096427 once i found a woman who was nine months pregnant but did not have a birth allowed certificate according to the policy she was forced to undergo an abortion surgery in the operation room i saw how the aborted childs lips were sucking how its limbs were stretching a physician injected poison into its skull and the child died and it was thrown into the trash can i was a monster in the daytime injuring others by the chinese communist authorities barbaric planned birth policy but in the evening i was like all other women and mothers enjoying my life with my children t o all those injured women to all those children who were killed i want to repent and say sincerely that im sorry
5096428 china has every reason to feel proud of and pleased with its remarkable achievements made in its family planning policy the country could offer its experiences and special expertise to help other countries
5096429 the unfpa firmly believes and so does the government of the peoples republic of china that their program is a totally voluntary program
5096430 in strictly quantitative terms it was the most successful family planning policy ever developed
5096431 supports or participates in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization
5096432 regrettably the prc has in place a regime of severe penalties on women who have unapproved births
5096433 unfpas support of and involvement in chinas population planning activities allows the chinese government to implement more effectively its program of coercive abortion therefore it is not permissible to continue funding unfpa at this time
5096434 china continues to employ coercion in its birth planning program including through severe penalties for out of plan births unfpa continues its support and involvement in chinas coercive birth limitation program in counties where chinas restrictive law and penalties are enforced by government officials

5096443 the reason science does manage to be astonishingly effective is not because large groups are automatically wiser or less prone to self deception than individuals history adequately demonstrates that if anything the opposite is more nearly the case science works because its core dynamics not its methods or techniques per se are rooted in pitting intellects against one another science eventually yields impressive answers because it compels smart people to incessantly try to disprove the ideas generated by other smart people
5096444 on what basis do we chose between the authority informed by the scientific method and the authority informed by revelation
5096445 what accounts for the effectiveness and utility of a worldview informed by the scientific method in terms of technology and its lack of utility in religion
5096446 why is authority founded on revelation relatively ineffective in producing useful models of the natural world
5096447 scientific beliefs in my opinion rest on appeals to authority and empirical appeals with the latter trumping the former anglican beliefs in my opinion rest on a balanced application of scripture to experience interpreted through the lens of tradition by means of reason
5096448 the scope of christianity is therefore bigger than the scope of science we know that we have access to some data which does not conform to objectivism uniformity and repeatability
5096449 it is assumed that any person with sufficient training and experience could become an authority and would then hold similar opinions
5096450 even the poet of genesis 1 and 2 was simply putting to words his observation of the physical world

5096458 honestly we werent all that prepared we didnt have a crib or anything
5096459 weve got some pretty crafty dads we converted some cupboards we got at a garage sale into a change table
5096460 the no 1 issue for most parents is safety when buying products for their children
5096461 however parents are way more aware of the environmental impact their choices are making i think the two really go hand in hand choosing safe and sustainable products leads to a safe world for our children to live in
5096462 both matt and i are conscious of buying things that are used to avoid the whole packaging issue and unnecessary production of products that already exist

5096555 when i came back to work on monday i sat down and wrote a new paper as fast as i could

5096675 surgery seems to help somewhat but it is pretty risky and thus not suitable for any situation less extreme than morbid obesity
5096676 not an 800 calorie diet for a month but a 1800 calorie diet for life and increased exercise also for life has anyone studied whether this works on the population level

5096678 bad outcomes of roux en y or banding procedures are some of the worst
5096679 my impression from what i remember from reading on these procedures years ago was that in general the risk benefit ratio was pretty decent for patients with severe or morbid obesity however i would be much less confident that the numbers would come out well for an overweight patient particularly one without other risk factors i e normotensive no diabetes normal cholesterol particularly given the risk that they might end up with malabsorption sydromes from the surgery
5096680 particularly given the risk that they might end up with malabsorption sydromes from the surgery
5096681 how do we undo the social changes that have led to increased obesity
5096682 a surgical procedure with a 0 5 30 day mortality is ridiculously dangerous for a condition that has an essentially nil 30 day mortality
5096683 i suggest that we need to do something similar to smoking cessation with obesity that is that
5096684 but the percentage of patients who stop smoking has increased over the years because of improved interventions and social changes banning smoking in bars higher taxes on tobacco i havent seen similar efforts going forward in the area of weight loss at least not successfully

5096692 we use some of it but most of it we bag up three four five pieces and let them take home what they need

5096703 we have assumed that for the first 72 hours we should rely on no one but ourselves because thats how long it takes for help to come
5096704 we hope this storm does not turn into a hurricane but if it does the damage will be minimal
5096705 as more and more information is collected and kept on all of us we are very concerned that appropriate safeguards go along with that
5096706 people should know what is happening with their information and have a choice
5096707 our concern is that what is kept with the justification of preventing and detecting terrorism can then be used for minor purposes such as pursuing people for parking fines

5096744 rick warren is at the forefront of a kind of younger generation of evangelical protestant leaders who want to have a christian public presence in the culture but who are less tied to the republican politics of their predecessors
5096745 theyre values oriented guys but less convinced that either their own principles or the best politics lies in a total commitment to the republican party

5096752 barack obama is going to get the same percentage of the religious vote that john kerry and al gore got

5096761 this is the equivalent for south africa and losing this match will hurt them
5096762 i think the guys have played enough cricket to understand the difference in intensity between warm up games and international cricket

5096867 you will never know when you will die whereas you always know today you are still alive
5096868 hindi ko kailangang magmakaawa sa inyong lahat para sabihing may talent naman ako
5096869 ive done modeling jobs in italy japan thailand hong kong china and here in the philippines it is only here in manila that i stayed for such a long time why i decided to stay because i love the people here i love the working here with my friends
5096870 some people ask me why i like it here whereas a lot of filipinos are wanting to leave the country i simply say that i have this certain connection with the country i feel very much at home here and there is so much to see in this country would you believe that i dont get bothered by the traffic here its one of the reasons why i stay because theres so much character in this country
5096871 its so funny because im living here for the past two years but i havent been to boracay
5096872 ive been hearing great stories about boracay from other tourists and i am always eager to go
5096873 but my chances to go to boracay have always been cancelled because of work ive cancelled my boracay trip twice because a modeling project suddenly comes up i cant afford to not do my work so i have to rebook and eventually cancel hopefully i would be able to go just as soon as my schedule is free
5096874 when i arrived here i speak very little english i only spoke portuguese spanish and a little french i need someone to translate tagalog for me pero ngayon marunong na ako
5096875 i tried reading local newspapers magazines and tabloids i practiced it by myself at first there are similar words in the spanish language that are also in tagalog kaya madali ng konti
5096876 i want to enroll in a language school to further hone my tagalog speaking skills i want to work with more people here and i dont want to have this language barrier gusto ko mag tagalog para maintindihan nila ako
5096877 i used to have one before pero wala na siya she was a filipina we were okay but i think we werent meant to be besides i want to concentrate on my work i can date anyone but no serious commitment
5096878 im happy that i was given an opportunity to explore other things aside from modeling singing and dancing i like to improve on my acting skills if its needed im open to a lot of possibilities im still young and i dont want to waste any chances to improve and get noticed
5096879 nilinaw ko na yun na walang intriga roon kung yun ang inaakala nila
5096880 when i signed up with bench stipulated sa contract na hindi ako basta lalabas sa underwear show wearing just underwear o yung tipong sexy
5096881 kasi based na rin yun sa personal convictions ko nagkataon lang kasi na kasunod niyon itong launching ng pure passion its not mainly the reason why i wasnt part of last months
5096882 before signing the contract personal request ko yun na sana hindi na ako part pa ng underwear show pinagbigyan naman nila at naiintindihan nila
5096883 tuloy pa rin yun inaayos na lang ang lahat and definitely it will be very different from lobo
5096884 may pagka mature pa rin yung roles namin ni angel bahala na roon ang direktor naming si rory quintos kung paano ang magiging execution sa gagawing movie if ever
5096885 super lakas sa takilya ang movie nila ni john lloyd cruz and shes already a box office star if you will look at it nang sabihin niya yun ang sabi ko sa mga taga star cinema fix na our schedules gusto kong gumawa agad ng movie with her
5096886 i find her very good hindi lang as a singer very versatile im very sure maggu grow pa siya given the opportunity to do a movie with her it will be my pride and pleasure
5096887 yeah i did some baring before maski sa movies baka gawin ko pa rin yan pero iba yung sa rampa hindi ko pa nagagawang rumampa nang nakahubad
5096888 i did ramp modeling before for inno sotto pero hindi naman ako nakahubad doon naka suit nga ako
5096889 sa commercials depende pa rin yan sa storyboard like sa san mig i have to do that kasi ang ini endorse ko sugar free its not naman ramp modelling di ba
5096890 lets see where god will take me pagdating sa bagay na yan bahala na ang diyos sa akin kung ano ba ang plano niya
5096891 kung saan niya ako dalhin i will just go there sa ngayon sa mga ginagawa ko sa showbiz i see to it na kasama ang panginoon doon kaya maingat ako and i have convictions to protect at sana respetuhin din yun ng ibang tao

5096894 but every time i think of her i fantasize about knives her impending death fire smothering or sexual abuse i know this isnt me and id never hurt my child and yet the thought keeps coming in am i going crazy
5096895 what does happen though are spells of obsessing over child abuse an only slightly less nightmarish version of foreseeing sakya die in a concentration camp which is what i visualized when i was carrying him at these times im driven to read everything i can about child abuse which leaves me with horrific and recurrent images i cant keep away and which arrive most clearly when hes at play it isnt all the time but its ugly when it happens
5096896 id really appreciate it if someone could talk me through this
5096897 you can know the name of a bird in all the languages of the world but when youre finished youll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird so lets look at the bird and see what its doing thats what counts i learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something

5096901 hindi naman sa napagod na ako pero siguro time out muna kasi masakit ang procedure ng in vitro
5096902 sa may puson ako ini inject ng gamot at nagkakapasa na nga ako noong mga unang months okey lang because desidido kami ni johnnny wong her husband to have our own baby pero sometimes its frustrating lalo na kung negative ang results
5096903 now nag decide muna kami to stop dahil gusto ko namang mag work siguro nga by working maaalis sa isipan ko ang pagbubuntis nakaka stress din because people always ask you about it lalo na ang family ko na excited na magkaroon na ako ng baby
5096904 for now trabaho naman muna ako i want to enjoy naman working again sa tv and even sa movies kaya nga i accepted the role in ploning kasi na miss ko ang maging busy sa showbiz and who knows kung kelan ako maging busy baka bigla na lang akong mabuntis di ba
5096905 four weeks tatakbo ang story na ito and tamang tama lang na may dumating na trabaho wala na kasi akong makakasama sa bahay kapag nasa trabaho si johnny
5096906 ngayon kasi yung mga anak ni johnny ay nasa guam na ulit because mag i start na ang classes nila kaya ang lungkut lungkot na naman sa bahay namin sobrang tahimik kasi wala na ang mga bata mabuti na lang at nagkaroon ako ng show to keep me busy
5096907 i would have stayed longer doon sa show kaso my doctor advised me na once i take invitro i should not stress myself with work at kailangan relaxed ako para maging effective ang procedure sinunod ko naman siya pero siguro nga hindi pa meant na magkaroon ako ng baby
5096908 but i am not giving up because i know that god has great plans for everyone alam ko na he has a baby for us hintayin na lang namin kung kelan niya gustong iregalo ito sa amin ni johnny
5096909 mommy yayo nga ang tawag niya sa akin up to now ang sa akin lang naman i know what baron is going through at alam ko na marami siyang problema sa sarili niya at sa pamilya niya ayokong magalit sa kanya nang todo kasi alam kong naiipit din siya
5096910 but im a mother and i have a daughter who was disrespected natural na mas kakampihan ko ang anak ko whatever transpires sa nangyayari ngayon sana ay walang masaktan sa amin alam ni baron na mahal ko siya bilang kaibigan but i love my family more maintindihan naman sana niya iyon
5096911 this is all a legal battle alam kong hindi madali lalo na for baron pero if this is the way para maitama ang isang maling bagay im all for it i stand by my daughter patrizhia and my husband william martinez we are a family at sama sama kaming lalaban
5096912 hindi ko alam ang tungkol diyan may nagsabi na sa akin about that pero ayokong mag assume na totoo yon mga abogado na lang namin siguro ang mag usap tungkol diyan
5096913 hindi ko talaga plinano na isunod but i spoke with mr ben chan kanina and i really apologized about not joining bench blackout because even before i signed up with them that was my only request
5096914 parang its really my conviction not to join and so i didnt want to offend also parang i just want to parang mas okay na rin na wala ako sa show kasi from the very beginning talaga hindi ako comfortable sa fashion show hindi ako comfortable na magrampa ng siguro nakahubad
5096915 never naman ako nag ramp nang nakahubad e i was doing ramp for inno sotto and hindi naman talaga ako nakahubad and with my commercials and the characters that i do its part of the campaign its not part of something na kailangan mo lang gawin just because you wanna show off
5096916 gusto ko muna i test yong waters sa independent films because its more broad and its more challenging
5096917 i dont wanna go head to head naman with star cinema because sila yong nag groom sa akin i believe that magkaiba naman ang market ng indie sa mainstream and im exclusive with star cinema and i signed up for three movies in three years with them you know if they let me co produce with them well its good
5096918 kapag na pack up kami medyo malaki rin ang gastos pero im learning how to do it to do the business
5096919 as much as possible hindi ako nakikialam sa expenses but there was a time na na pack up kami sa malabon dumpsite because it was raining so hard also last night we were short because it rained again
5096920 ang hirap birth pains because i never thought na ganun pala kahirap mag taping kapag napa pack up ka but you know wed like to provide more jobs for a lot of people and kasama ng trabaho yon e
5096921 sobrang taas noon hindi ko na maabot baka mapiyok ako
5096922 o sige grace ibuna na lang pasalamat ka hindi ko pa alam yung iba
5096923 marami akong pagkukulang sa kanila ito ang pagkakataon ko para makabawi ako sa kanila
5096924 dati magkasama kami ng anak niyang si ruffa noon ngayon sina richard gutierrez at kc concepcion na ang magkasama sa movie kaya puwede nang balae ang itawag ko sa kanya pero pag naghiwalay balik ulit sa tita annabelle
5096925 hindi ako papatol sa mga isyu na yan luma na yan tapos na yung mga birthdays nila dingdong and marian ang tagal tagal na sinasadya talaga at pinagplanuhan
5096926 wala okey lang sa akin yun natutuwa ako sa kanila tuwang tuwa ako natutuwa ako sa ginawa ninyo hindi ko alam kung bakit ninyo ginawa yan pero okey lang sa akin wala tayong magagawa kasi nandiyan na yan maraming salamat sa lahat
5096927 tsaka sa akin ang importante ay yung dalawa richard and kc nagtatrabaho sila tinatapos nila yung pelikula nila at maganda yung movie sinisigurado ko yun lahat ng tao manonood nito kasi unang una bagong chemistry first time nila nagsama magandang maganda yung pelikula kaya lahat talaga magugustuhan nila ito
5096928 sa mga fans nila kc at richard sana suportahan nila yung for the first time kasi napakaganda ng pelikulang ito at pag napanood na nila puwede nilang ulit ulitin kasi napakaganda
5096929 i consider piolo as part of the family wala namang problema sa akin kasi bench yan were not just working for bench kasama kami sa isang malaking pamilya kaya dapat hindi na iniisip yung sarili lang kapakanan
5096930 im here to support all of them maski sina dingdong dantes at richard gutierrez kahit sino sa kanila ang mayroong ganitong event kung welcome ang presence ko why not pupunta at pupunta ako
5096931 ang stand ko pa rin diyan yung pabayaan na lang natin sila ang mag solve niyan let annabelle rama and ben chan settle whatever there is to settle yeah its true i told richard to talk to his mom regarding the issue
5096932 ang concern ko kasi yung sa bench mismo wala akong intention na makialam i know annabelle mabait naman yan kaya lang naging emotional kaya kung may lumabas mang issue that richard is staying with bench hindi na ako magtataka dahil kailangan lang talaga riyan mag usap usap sila at hindi dapat magpadala sa intriga
5096933 wala na sa akin yan kasi ini enjoy ko na lang yung hard work na ginugol ko all through the years ito na yung balik sa akin sila naman ang kailangang magtrabaho nang husto para tumagal din sila sa business na ito at patuloy na mag survive
5096934 kailangan kasi ng maturity para harapin ang ganyang mga bagay ang sa akin lang sa mga nagawa ko na sa mga na achieve ko kahit paano i should be secure na sa ngayon palagay ko hindi naman ako basta maitutumba lang
5096935 kasi trabaho yan as an actor hindi naman puwedeng palaging leading man ang roles ko i should do character roles like right now enjoy akong gawin yung role ko sa
5096936 may pagkakataon na babalik uli ako sa pagbibida depende na lang sa project sa rami ng papel na bidang nagawa ko na nagugustuhan ko ring mag tackle ng character or villain roles na i find challenging din naman
5096937 hiyang hiya nga ako dahil naroon pa si kiko senator francis pangilinan
5096938 wala akong magawa dahil kasama ko si lucy torres gomez his wife and she told me to go up the stage dahil yung ibang leading men ni sharon umakyat din doon
5096939 wala naman sigurong masama pero happy ako sa reaction ng mga tao that only means na hanggang ngayon marami pa rin kaming napapaligaya ni sharon
5096940 wala pang formal negotation between star cinema and douglas quijano his manager pero most likely kung magsasama kami ni sharon sa pelikula it will be with star cinema sa gma films kasi hindi ko alam kung ano ang priority nila roon

5096949 the pain specialists in pain research it has been assumed that most nociceptive neurons are polymodal responding to different damaging stimuli by means of a repertoire of cell surface receptors specialized for the detection of particular types of insult attempts to ascribe pain modalities and behavior to individual sensory neuron receptors have been problematic probably because of the existence of multiple damage sensing molecules now however by genetically ablating subsets of nociceptors followed by behavioral and eletrophysiological assays abrahamsen et al p 702 have found that sensory neurons expressing a specific type of sodium channel na v 1 8 have a modality specific function in pain transmission na v 1 8 expressing sensory neurons are essential for cold mechanical and inflammatory pain behavior strikingly neuropathic and heat pain behavior do not require na v 1 8 expressing neurons

5097032 i want to apologize to nascar to our partners to toyota guys a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5097033 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were
5097034 for us we kind of feel like in the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and chief engine builder mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5097035 the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped to come back and win it again thats awesome
5097036 thats a great story that wasnt able to be told
5097037 well figure out exactly what happened and those that were responsible
5097038 theres going to be punishment for that thats just part of life you cant do that
5097039 if this alleged incident proves true it goes against everything we stand for as an organization
5097040 we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us
5097041 i found out about it halfway through the day session last night when i went over there to see what was going on
5097042 i was surprised to see what was happening and astonished and frankly incredulous i couldnt believe it was happening because its clearly defined in the entry forms that you dont do this sort of thing
5097043 but im sure joe and j d will take care of that internally and whatever fans think theyre going to think were just going to keep working on our stuff
5097044 its not something that you like to hear about and you have to just question every chassis dyno thats ever been run on every toyota
5097045 you look at the no 32 car of brian vickers and red bull racing the 32 and the 18 and the 20 made about the same power the first run on the dyno when they took the magnet or whatever this device was out of the 18 and the 20 they both came up
5097046 what i dont know is if its a toyota problem if its a joe gibbs thing how widespread is it and how long has it been going on because a lot of whats been done by nascar has been based on the chassis dyno results
5097047 its disappointing to hear that anybody whether its a manufacturer or a team or an individual on a team would go to any length to do that
5097048 if theyre going to make decisions based on parity after theyve given toyota what theyve given them with regard to parameters on their engine based on flawed data that a team or the manufacturer one of the other had kited or shaved that certainly is detrimental to my interests
5097049 last month home secretary jacqui smith unveiled plans for crime maps to be published across britain prompting claims that she had taken the idea from mayor boris johnson who had pledged to introduce them in london in his manifesto
5097050 anyone who promotes their own blogs should be exterminated is anybody interested really who cares i got out of bed today i had food i performed bodily functions i walked the dogs i had food i went back to bed i sneezed how fascinating is that
5097051 i am so in love with you and i just cant sic stop imagining you in that ss uniform with your ridding crop glistening with my own blood after you have given me a beating because i really deserve it
5097052 y ou half wit if she wants to have a child with you lets hope it doesnt inherit your moronic stupidity and shallowness wipe the drool from this imbeciles face please

5097057 i know where you live and im going to get you c nt
5097058 im just hoping that i can get the word out so that it doesnt happen to anyone else
5097059 every four years for the last who knows how long
5097060 they dont have something positive to say about what theyre going to do for america what they try to do is they say well this other guy hes unpatriotic or this other guy he likes french people thats what they said about kerry or you know they try to make it out like somehow democrats arent tough enough or arent macho enough
5097061 thats their strategy and they do it every four years and then you end up with what weve got right now i have news for john mccain my plans not gonna bring about economic disaster we already have economic disaster from john mccains president george w bush and we cant afford another four years or eight years of george bush policies and thats why we are gonna beat john mccain in this election to put america on a new path
5097062 now everything that he talks about is how much he suffered he was the fattest prisoner that got off the plane
5097063 respectfully im gonna disagree with you when it comes to mccain and his service i think his policies are terrible i think his service was honorable and i think he deserves respect for that
5097064 but i think your general point about his policies though are absolutely right i mean look john mccain wants to present himself as a maverick right he always says im a maverick im a maverick im a maverick let me tell you something every single one of his top people are all lobbyists for the very special interests that have been dominating washington all these years

5097085 this feeds into their idea that this is a religious war and its not
5097086 they want it to be a war of religions but we have said very clearly that this is not a war on islam its not christianity vs islam in some way its about radicals its about extremists who are using violence

5097097 no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempt to legalize ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to its knees and undermine our democratic system
5097098 georgia is a sovereign state and the territorial integrity of the state must be provided for

5097119 the patient must utilise the technology usefully in the correct perspective instead of dissection discussion and hair splitting
5097120 the internet which is very useful to most of us can supply ideas to the patient to gain knowledge to pose intelligent questions to the urologist and forget the actual purpose of the visit to the doctor
5097121 the urologist may have a tough time treating such patients successfully and satisfactorily
5097122 the way i look at it if you get something from a doctor you dont like you find a doctor that gives you better options i found another doctor who said id live seven to 20 years so i like that doctor better
5097123 ive missed two of the three games with richmond senior since andrew has been on the varsity
5097124 he tries to be involved as much as he can without being intrusive
5097125 i aspire to be as strong as him and tough in all areas of life
5097126 i knew it drove him crazy to be as uninvolved as he was just going to the games i was happy for him that hes found a way to get a little more satisfaction feeling a part of the team
5097127 he could play linebacker for us but hes sacrificed for the team to play offensive line
5097128 hes a little undersized to be a lineman 6 1 220 but hes tough as nails
5097129 i dont know what level of football he can play but he would be a valuable member of any team because hes that kind of kid
5097130 its important for our family as much as it is for the team
5097131 its a last chance to get a ring im just ready to get going

5097133 for a long time people kind of got use to going to the doctors and filing a claim now its like we want the whole bill upfront
5097134 we are like any other business we have to collect our money to pay our bills its far easier to collect upfront than to go after someone on the back end

5097158 im always blown away by the amount of discipline and hard work it takes for those olympians to get where theyre at

5097191 what i am proud of is the performance of the new zealand team three medals for rowing is just fantastic the platform was set and they performed but i dont take any credit for that i didnt expect any less from them

5097198 the doctor said well it looks like hes got all the symptoms of west nile virus
5097199 i called the state health department because i needed to know how long he was going to be sick
5097200 i was just bawling i thought he was going to die
5097201 he was diagnosed with epstein barr virus which is pretty much the same thing but you dont die from it
5097202 i dont blame him because all the doctors are doing it
5097203 id like to know how many people have been told they have west nile
5097204 this has been going on since west nile came into utah some doctors will base things on symptoms and not do tests
5097205 like any medical test they can be expensive and if people dont have insurance then sometimes the doctor will go ahead and try to help the patient
5097206 whether theyre helping or not may be something of a question
5097207 he said well it sounds like youve got west nile
5097208 it was really strange it was just contradictory to what we had heard on the news and what seemed to be happening everywhere
5097209 i ended up going to the doctor in the springtime
5097210 they found out that i was really anemic the question i have now is did i ever really have it am i immune to it am i going to get it again
5097211 people who have been told they have it are out on the lake not really worrying about it
5097212 i cant imagine how many people have been told that
5097213 maybe theres something seriously wrong that they dont know about and they say nah its west nile
5097214 we try to do education for physicians and stuff like that thats the best we can do is try to educate people of what tests to draw and those kinds of things
5097215 thats the only way to tell for sure if theres west nile
5097216 this is the first case that ive seen in my 12 years in a situation where you have patients with legitimate and serious problems who are receiving a drug that is not authorized by the food drug and administration

5097220 to be loved in this place is to be lashed firmly to the mast with eyes rolling and tongue lolling and body resisting the ties and thrusting full force against that which spares an early grave and once loved he finds himself secured to the posts in the old game of struggle where a tangle of submission and conquering proves ones being absolute and possession comes in a fervent claiming of places exotic and tight and warm and wet and wanting and once loved she finds herself fastened to the chains of a dream world where one might hide in the promise of a fast and jarring entrance and the security of orgasm comes in an impassioned release and the union of flesh and fluid and function

5097263 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5097264 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5097265 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

5097321 the last thing we need in tower hamlets is a questionable organisation getting its claws stuck into our communities
5097322 destruction of the islamic khilafah state over 80 years ago
5097323 the beginning of dividing the muslim world into countless nation states governed by a plethora of kings dictators and western backed democrats
5097324 its an organisation that preaches intolerance and division and there should be no place for it
5097325 so its disappointing that theyre coming to tower hamlets when so many people are working hard to build up community relations
5097326 its quite frankly disgusting that this organisation will be holding a conference in tower hamlets
5097327 it is hard to understand how a conference which is discussing the political future of the muslim world and presenting a positive series of solutions is divisive
5097328 is there any particular timeline you need to adhere to

5097335 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5097336 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5097337 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza

5097340 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5097341 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5097342 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5097343 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5097344 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5097345 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5097346 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5097347 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5097348 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n

5097350 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5097351 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5097352 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5097353 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5097354 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5097355 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5097356 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5097357 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5097358 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5097359 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5097360 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5097361 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5097362 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5097363 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5097364 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5097365 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5097366 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5097367 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5097368 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
5097369 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
5097370 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5097371 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5097372 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5097373 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad

5097375 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5097376 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii

5097381 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5097382 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5097383 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5097384 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance

5097388 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5097389 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5097390 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5097391 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5097392 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5097393 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5097394 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5097395 the university is top heavy with management countless hours are wasted with paperwork with attending mind numbing training sessions on this that or the other and on seminars which for the most part are a complete waste of time
5097396 more could be done to make the toilets and urinals more efficient in our building we often find the urinals run constantly or two flush simultaneously when the button is pressed
5097397 the university should strive to enforce the non smoking regulations on campus more effectively people are still smoking they are annoying me
5097398 i am sharing a room with others in an award winning building the air con does not work when the temp is comfortable and there is only one power button for 18 lights
5097399 something simply has to be done about our current email system it is just so unreliable
5097400 let me explain something to you the people on these sites theyre the cast of one flew over the cuckoos nest im telling you to open the ward room window and climb on out before they give you a pre frontal lobotomy and i have to smother you with a pillow
5097401 to turn a new page in australias history by righting the wrongs of the past and so moving forward with confidence to the future
5097402 australians of this generation should not be required to accept guilt and blame for past actions and policies over which they had no control
5097403 i wanted to know that i would have the ability to call the shots
5097404 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5097405 but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave
5097406 have to call an extraordinary meeting of the council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5097407 this is not a problem we can drill our way out of
5097408 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it
5097409 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5097410 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5097411 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5097412 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5097413 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution
5097414 nazario said that he was asked are they dead yet
5097415 ive put in applications everywhere for everything but nobody wants to hire you if you have been indicted
5097416 my faith in the system is shaken theres no doubt about that
5097417 there are no bodies no forensic evidence no crime scene and no identities
5097418 its been such an unbelievable ride with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it took was a little imagination
5097419 i dont know what to feel right now its so emotional all i want to do is go see my mom
5097420 to be honest i was thinking not to blow the lead
5097421 i was really nervous going into this race i just wanted to take it out as hard as i could and hold on as strong as i could
5097422 without the help of my relay teammates this isnt possible
5097423 if youve got to have a train derailment this is the type to have
5097424 i mean were not dealing with any pressurized containers were very minor on the hazmat our guys were quick to get in there and stabilize the hazardous materials that were at the water treatment plant

5097431 tambi n es el reflejo de lo que est pasando en espa a
5097432 ha sido la consecuencia primero del desarrollo econ mico que hemos experimentado en las ltimas d cadas
5097433 un crecimiento vertiginoso de empresas productoras de conciertos y en general de gesti n cultural en los ltimos 15 a os
5097434 se ha creado a lo largo de estos ltimos 15 a os p blico para los conciertos y ha crecido por inercia la demanda y por tanto la oferta
5097435 antes el concierto era casi una promoci n del disco y hoy el disco es casi una promoci n del concierto con lo que los artistas se han visto obligados con toda seguridad a estar m s en directos porque sus ingresos de la venta de discos se han mermado
5097436 no es habitual que los artistas hagan giras todos los a os sino cada dos cada tres o m s a os
5097437 el a o que viene habr menos conciertos con toda probabilidad
5097438 la programaci n de conciertos grandes se hace casi con un a o de antelaci n
5097439 ha cogido de sopet n a mucha gente que hab a firmado contratos y que se ve obligada a hacer el concierto como sea para no quedar en mal lugar
5097440 la crisis se nota hasta en el bolsillo del p blico
5097441 los patrocinios son los mismos y los cach s de los artistas no han bajado
5097442 se va a autorregular el mercado y la oferta se reducir a una expresi n m s racional
5097443 en agenda pol tica en prioridad pol tica y en objetivo pol tico del gobierno
5097444 la cultura no vende su alma si reconoce que tiene efectos en otros mbitos como el industrial el tur stico o el social
5097445 los conciertos en canarias requieren un apoyo de patrocinio p blico
5097446 de que las ayudas necesarias para acometer los concierto hayan provenido de la ue

5097450 the good news is obviously no state is better prepared or organized to deal with whatever comes this way than the state of florida

5097455 obama said that had he been in the u s senate two years ago he would have voted for the born alive infants protection act even though he voted against a state version of the proposal the federal version was approved the state version was not the difference between the state and federal versions obama explained was that the state measure lacked the federal language clarifying that the act would not be used to undermine roe vs wade the 1973 u s supreme court opinion that legalized abortion

5097464 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5097465 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
5097466 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
5097467 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
5097468 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
5097469 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
5097470 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
5097471 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

5097475 la ruta est clara lo que viene a decir en palabra de brujo
5097476 now i think the behavior recently suggests that perhaps russia has not taken that route or that they would like to have it both ways that is that you behave in a 1968 way toward your neighbors by invading them and at the same time you continue to integrate into the political and diplomatic and economic and security structures of the international community and i think the fact is you cant have it both ways

5097483 this is not the end i knew i was pushing it coming in with 3 weeks of running you cant take shortcuts in the marathon
5097484 the match has struck the fuse has been lit and four or five years from now opec producers are going to be drinking their own oil and choking on it
5097485 i would ask all the fundamental guys why oil was 147 a month ago and 114 today
5097486 their opinion that crude moves purely on real demand is bs when the fast money comes out theres a giant sucking sound
5097487 you had a perfect storm of pre olympics demand in china a plunging dollar speculation cold weather and fear of supply disruptions in nigeria and iran pushing it up and now theyve all swung around on a dime
5097488 people who dont trade the futures markets dont realize that this is typical for commodities which always trade on emotion look at silver in the late 1970s which went from 4 to 50 and back to 4 in two years
5097489 we never base our view on energy industry stocks on the direction of oil prices
5097490 we are buying growth companies in a growth industry and always have at least a five year horizon the fundamentals of the business increasing demand and decreasing supply over the long term favor higher stock values over time
5097491 to get to that level while supply from the best and biggest fields in the middle east north sea and gulf of mexico is shrinking will be very tough
5097492 oil prices are going up to ration supply short of a total global economic meltdown
5097493 this is multicultural britain and one of its fault lines runs straight through our childrens classrooms how do we reconcile scientific truth with the deeply held convictions that bind religious communities
5097494 cant get in to the business of knocking down kids religions and the religions of families

5097498 the windows security log is extremely important to monitoring all aspects of windows security but its safe to say the windows security log is also the most poorly documented area of windows 2000 and windows server 2003
5097499 for most events microsoft s documentation simply restates the static text of the events description while some information does exist its riddled with inaccuracies most important there is insufficient guidance and very little background information for individual events nor are events described in context with other events there are no suggested courses of action
5097500 security log event ids and codes vary from one windows version to the next making security log knowledge even more arcane this complicates the design of programs that monitor the security log
5097501 due to the lack of accurate documentation ive reverse engineered every event id in the security log along with the codes and other detailed fields within each event along the way ive developed an understanding of events in relation to each other and been able to link user and administrator level actions with patterns of events the security log tells a lot of stories if you know how to read the tea leaves
5097502 one of the most challenging factors in effectively monitoring windows is the fact that each system has its own security log containing its discrete portion of your networks overall security activity

5097534 i always read your column and then the daily tail piece one of the many things that caught my attention was that marriage is not two people in one boat but two people each person in his or her own boat i think my husband would like us to be joined together and have us share a brain his brain of course he asks my opinion and then always improves on what i say when im on the phone he tells me what to say and corrects me sometimes he even shouts at me and the person on the other end can hear because we work together i try to ignore it to avoid having a bad day but every now and then i explode then it gets nasty and he hurls verbal abuse at me bringing up my family and poor upbringing

5097539 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5097540 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5097541 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
5097542 in 1998 i found myself watching baseball history in the making as mark mcgwire and sammy sosa battled it out for the top spot in the home run race the closer they got to the record set by roger maris the angrier i found myself getting after all roger maris went through hell to set that record in 1961 the powers that be thought that no one would ever surpass babe ruths record of 60 home runs in one season and here was maris about to break that record while playing for the very same team in an attempt to keep ruths record alive they placed an asterisk next to maris record to explain that he hit the home runs in a season that contained more games than ruths record season
5097543 when it comes to american history there are a few subjects that have grabbed my attention to the extent that i decided to research them on my own the civil war and the vietnam war these wars fascinated me
5097544 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5097545 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
5097546 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
5097547 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
5097548 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5097549 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5097550 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5097551 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
5097552 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
5097553 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
5097554 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5097555 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5097556 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5097557 im happy for crouch because now he can play more games its very important for him because its better
5097558 if a player plays only one game a month its not enough you lose the confidence this is very important for everything
5097559 i saw him in pre season against villarreal and he was fit enough
5097560 dietmar hopp grew up here in hoffenheim this is his club and his town
5097561 he wants to develop and support our youth teams its absolutely not comparable with chelsea
5097562 sooner or later hoffenheim are going to become a superpower in german football
5097563 obviously as a newly promoted side anything more than just staying up this season would be good but we are honestly not thinking beyond our next match
5097564 they have exposed a very limited set of capabilities that this architecture is capable of
5097565 next generation fibre channel storage systems market forecast 2007 2011
5097566 in addition to supporting multiple active controllers clustered systems virtualize the individual controllers and make the entire set of controllers appear as one single storage system to hosts
5097567 i believe the architecture has these features but ibm didnt feel comfortable presenting them to the market yet
5097568 weird nothing from ibm other than the announcement letters posted to ibm com world wide not even a press release no customer stories
5097569 maybe this whole xiv thing wasnt really all that big a deal after all
5097570 theyve taken a very conservative step in presenting this product to the market
5097571 on the contrary i think its because ibm is ibm and they like to do things in a conservative fashion

5097577 my brother hes operating in this area and yes me n graybush go way back and i have older hardware than you guys because its more resilient to electromagnetic pulse anything else
5097578 yeah how much of you is still flesh and blood
5097579 why did you answer smalls when he asked you that but not me
5097580 c3i says hot lz so lock and load switch to cyber comm encryption seven two alpha channel two
5097581 he has had a terrible spell with injury we are all disappointed for him but he will have to come back again
5097582 it shows we can expect a reasonable season but its only the start it is satisfying to beat a club like rennes who are playing in europe the club is growing and we are building
5097583 we had a few good opportunities but they failed we hit the bar and we were up against a really good keeper fabien audard who made some reflex saves
5097584 obviously being an american playing for germany traitor is the first thing that comes to your mind
5097585 he said when youre playing the u s a im going for u s a basically he didnt want to support me when i played the u s a he said i hope the u s a beats you

5097610 shows once again how political the sponsorship of the olympics is for the chinese
5097611 bring some sanity and proportion back to both the opening ceremony and the games themselves
5097612 and it was a very important and serious thing that involved national interests and an order from a state leader from the politburo
5097613 it was about presenting the nations music and cultural image especially because it was as the national flag entered the birds nest
5097614 the girl shown on television had to have the most perfect voice and be perfect looking it was fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi
5097615 i have an obligation to make this explanation to the chinese audience
5097616 clever child with indeed a beautiful voice and painting and singing talents
5097617 she is a good child kind hearted cute friendly and low profile with a very calm heart she loves performing peking opera and has participated in shows on international volunteers day
5097618 its harmful to both girls and it is discomforting to know that a girl was instructed to mime while the other had no chance to show her face due to an allegedly unattractive appearance
5097619 why do we have to compromise honesty for these so called national interests
5097620 we received two orders in a row yesterday morning urging us to delete the article immediately and not to allow any publicity on this issue
5097621 wed been through several inspections theyre all very strict when we rehearsed at the spot there were several spectators from various divisions especially leaders from the politburo who gave the opinion it must change
5097622 shows once again how political the sponsorship of the olympics is for the chinese
5097623 bring some sanity and proportion back to both the opening ceremony and the games themselves
5097624 either the view or the country dont match the affiliation of the reporter then that country has had it at least in the hysterical english language press that standard bearer of self righteous morality and sole arbiter of universal taste
5097625 the page was removed by china com cn however there was a baidu cached page no mention of crooked teeth and chubby fat face
5097626 either the view or the country dont match the affiliation of the reporter then that country has had it at least in the hysterical english language press that standard bearer of self righteous morality and sole arbiter of universal taste
5097627 that papers are biased useless as far as most things are concerned but not sourav
5097628 mr chen disclosed in interviews that producers had pulled peiyi a seven year old beijing girl with a
5097629 we didnt expect miaoke to become so popular overnight and it would be a big embarrassment if miaoke was shaped into a singing star but later it was discovered that she had no musical talent
5097630 this is a smarter way of letting the public know something that it will know sooner or later but i dont think this thing was a big thing to start with
5097631 embarrassed that their beautiful dream of the patriotic song had burst
5097632 there were a number of candidates to sing the song and the artistic directors just picked the best voice and the best performer
5097633 you have to make sure the performance and the song are at the highest level it is a casting or a technical decision by the producer
5097634 you can have different opinions but sport is exactly the same
5097635 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing that hes going to stay on the bench
5097636 i think maybe on this one some people would believe that maybe it was not appropriate but the others would have said its fantastic because the performance was great thats what it is in sport and in life
5097637 we were very pleased with its outcome of one of the most complicated events to organise in the world
5097638 later it was discovered that she had no musical talent
5097639 they made us sign and chop a document saying we would not allow black people in during the olympics
5097640 but no one is willing to say so because well all get deported and have our business shut
5097641 we simply cant let them in during the olympics its what i was told
5097642 its the restrictions on blacks definitely happening it will all happen in 24 hours
5097643 they local police call meetings and everyone has to go or else if you dont go theyll come back and shut you down
5097644 black guys can come in and drink as long as they have valid visas
5097645 but we have been told to watch out for black guys acting suspiciously such as constantly talking on their mobile phones the aim is to crack down on drug dealing
5097646 if this is policy then it is a very bad policy more so for a country holding an olympics
5097647 uniformed public security bureau officers came into the bar recently and told me not to serve black people or mongolians
5097648 i understand that the government is trying to stop certain illegal activities but i dont think blanket discrimination is going about it the right way
5097649 chinese people are prejudiced but i would have hoped that the government would set a better example as it debuts on the world stage
5097650 the officials told me to inform my customers that they must at all times carry their passports or id cards
5097651 security is important but beijing is becoming a fortress and thats not attractive
5097652 the local police told us to get rid of the tables because theyre scared that if too many foreigners congregate outside there could be trouble

5097686 we didnt expect miaoke to become so popular overnight and it would be a big embarrassment if miaoke was shaped into a singing star but later it was discovered that she had no musical talent

5097688 embarrassed that their beautiful dream of the patriotic song had burst
5097689 there were a number of candidates to sing the song and the artistic directors just picked the best voice and the best performer
5097690 you have to make sure the performance and the song are at the highest level it is a casting or a technical decision by the producer

5097702 but we have been told to watch out for black guys acting suspiciously such as constantly talking on their mobile phones the aim is to crack down on drug dealing

5097842 reading up on how the anglo american tradition of free speech came about i came across many examples of one man proprietorships in the early days the fellow who owned the gutenberg was also reporter editor publisher printer delivery boy and business manager no surprise these people did what they did because they had a point to make generally it was a religious one and parenthetically one of the things least understood now is how large is the blood debt owed by the secular right of free speech to stubborn protestant printers of the 16th and 17th centuries who fought authorities to present truth as they saw it

5097844 we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately 4 8 million no outstanding long term debt and 10 715 130 common shares outstanding the company estimates that it presently has sufficient funds to meet its cash requirements through march 31 2009 however the companys cash needs could change as a result of potential payments that the company may be required to make to allergan which could be material under the allergan agreement and other matters the company will need to obtain additional capital through the issuance of its securities debt financings licensing arrangements joint ventures or other transactions management also believes that it could reduce or delay certain variable of discretionary costs to help meet its working capital needs

5097846 these changes are designed to streamline management and refocus the company in the cardiovascular space where we believe we will have the greatest growth potential while we continue our presence and seek opportunities in the wound care post surgical and pain areas which have been our historical areas of concentration the cardiovascular area will represent the key future focus and investment priority of the company

5097850 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5097851 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

5097865 the only way to get the water out of the valley next to the highway is through pumps and hoses going across the road and every time a car passes over it stops the flow
5097866 its just a matter of getting it cleared out so the rain thats coming throughout this evening and overnight can flow freely and not cause any further trouble
5097867 if we can get those opened up itll greatly diminish the amount of water up there
5097868 people are talking about runs they havent seen for a decade or more
5097869 what were seeing this year is an increase in marine survival we dont know why theres a whole new international research program gearing up to try and find answers about whats happening to the fish in the ocean but whatever has changed the grilse are back this year the numbers of salmon are consistent with other years and what we should see is a big increase in large salmon next year
5097870 theres usually a good relationship between grilse returns one year and salmon returns the following year

5097876 our speaker got up and just praised brian we were all excited about it
5097877 she was almost running on the spot she was so excited
5097878 weve been very much praying for him and his team
5097879 she was yelling and they were all screaming in the background and they were having a great time and totally celebrating and taking it all in
5097880 they were a much much stronger boat this year theyre such a solid group and theyre determined thats all it takes
5097881 we know its a lot of stress and anything can happen for him to hang on and have a little bit of kick left in there is just incredible

5097893 people and news media tend to focus on what is considered to be controversial rather than focus on the issues that are relevant to a lot of the countries in the region

5097941 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5097942 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5097943 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5097944 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5097945 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5097946 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5097947 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5097948 shell be substantially rewarded and deservedly so the phone has been ringing there is no doubt about that

5097951 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5097952 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5097953 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5097954 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5097955 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5097956 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5097957 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5097958 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5097959 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5097960 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5097961 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5097962 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5097963 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5097964 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

5097991 a equipe sentiu o segundo gol e a possibilidade de rea o fica reduzida a se precipita as jogadas estivemos muito abaixo do normal

5098028 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5098029 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

5098043 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5098044 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5098045 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5098046 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5098047 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5098048 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5098049 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5098050 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5098051 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5098052 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5098053 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5098054 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5098055 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5098056 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

5098060 it was startling to see that small acknowledgment of sexuality and femininity peeking out of the conservative aesthetically speaking environment of congress after all it wasnt until the early 90s that women were even allowed to wear pants on the senate floor it was even more surprising to note that it was coming from clinton someone who has been so publicly ambivalent about style image and the burdens of both

5098071 the world has failed to effectively end genocide in darfur chinese and russian vetoes in the u n foiled efforts to impose sanctions on zimbabwe the world has failed to implement effective measures to deter irans nuclear ambitions
5098072 the logic is the same groups with a strong narrow interest are able to block larger groups with a diffuse interest the narrow chinese interest in sudanese oil blocks the worlds general interest in preventing genocide irans narrow interest in nuclear weapons trumps the worlds general interest in preventing a middle east arms race diplomacy goes assymetric and the small defeat the large

5098287 but he said to me i want to play and that was good enough for me
5098288 i had no option in the end because we lost claudio cacapa to injury and i just told him to enjoy it
5098289 he came in and played very well and will get better and better for us
5098290 we havent signed that many but what we have got is real quality and that showed against man united
5098291 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5098292 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5098293 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5098294 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5098295 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5098296 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5098297 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5098298 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5098299 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5098300 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5098301 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5098302 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5098303 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5098304 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5098305 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5098306 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5098307 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5098308 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5098309 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5098310 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5098311 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5098312 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5098313 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5098314 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5098315 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5098316 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5098317 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5098318 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5098319 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5098320 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5098321 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5098322 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5098323 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5098324 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5098325 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5098326 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5098327 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5098328 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5098329 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5098330 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5098331 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5098332 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5098333 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5098334 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5098335 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5098336 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5098337 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5098338 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5098339 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5098340 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5098341 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5098342 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5098343 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5098344 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5098345 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5098346 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5098347 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5098348 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5098349 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5098350 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5098351 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5098352 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5098353 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5098354 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5098355 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
5098356 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5098357 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5098358 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5098359 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5098360 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5098361 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5098362 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5098363 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5098364 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5098365 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5098366 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5098367 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5098368 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5098369 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5098370 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5098371 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5098372 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5098373 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5098374 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5098375 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5098376 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5098377 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
5098378 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
5098379 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
5098380 happy mulatto and negative darkie how michelle is ruining our
5098381 house negro and field hand how michelle obama is the bad colored

5098388 the amount senoia proposed for the operation of the branch library was insufficient as a result i can not approve the contract as written
5098389 i think we may have reached a tentative way to work this out
5098390 neither theron nor paul could deny that it wasnt fair for different areas to pay different rates for the libraries
5098391 i think it is up to the library board to approve from there
5098392 basically agreed that ultimately this needs to be totally funded by the county
5098393 for a certain length of time to help the transition in the budget process
5098394 everybody realizes that this is a county library system and that it should be county funded
5098395 were doing this to help the county get some time to adjust their budgeting process to it
5098396 i think the simplest way to do that is to have the library board handle the whole process and we can contribute the impact fee money
5098397 that way the library board is running the whole process and its not different people

5098662 in your judgment how serious to us national security is the threat of radical islam in the 21
5098663 even though we were fighting in vietnam our real threat was the soviet union but i would say to you joel that the threat that radical islam presents to not only america but to the world today is an even more serious threat than when we were in a nuclear standoff during the cold war and its more concerning to me because this is an enemy that is hard to understand it is an enemy that is easy to ignore and it is an enemy that is absolutely relentless
5098664 i think the worst case scenario is that they continue in their pursuit of weapons of mass destruction
5098665 weapons of mass destruction are available to them now particularly chemical and biological and those are not hard to make but the worst case scenario is i think that they have nuclear capabilities that within these terrorist organizations within the jihadist movement that they intimidate europe to the point that europe is no longer capable of standing against them as they have done historically and that they take their extremism to the entire world and people start to buckle under the intimidation and pressure of really what i would see as a huge islamic movement
5098666 we know that he ahmadinejad has centrifuges spinning we know that he has the technology he has the scientists and he certainly has the determination ahmadinejad is a very very dangerous man in my view i believe that the world should pay close attention to what he has said some would say well thats just rhetoric but lets go back and look at hitlers rhetoric in 1933 and what ultimately occurred
5098667 i think ahmadinejad is far more dangerous than the ayatollah khomeini because given that he now has more resources
5098668 certainly has more money as a result of the oil in iran he has greater weapons capabilities he has a more sophisticated army and military in general and regardless of what the 2007 national intelligence estimate says he is developing nuclear capabilities

5098681 i saw his lap times improve gradually and i think by the end of the day his lap times got a lot better
5098682 i saw his pit stops get better and better so there are a lot of little things he got better at and well build on them and get better from here on out
5098683 the biggest thing i told him that i couldnt prepare him for no matter how many times we talked was the difference between a nationwide series race and a sprint cup series race
5098684 the biggest difference is intensity when they drop the green in sprint cup those guys are out for blood where in the nationwide series it isnt that way they dont really run as hard as they do in cup in cup these guys all 43 of them run 99 percent every single lap in nationwide its not that way and so the intensity level is hugely different and how hard these guys push these cars its what makes it the sprint cup series
5098685 it was an honor to drive this dlp toyota and i think i can build on this
5098686 ive got to learn to help the team set up the car the way i want it i still dont know what i want its still a learning process and the rest of the year im going to be learning a lot
5098687 it was a great all around weekend for us we qualified third and ran ninth we were in the top 10 all day we just got loose in the middle part of the race and lost some track position but fought back there at the end of the race im proud of my stanley tools guys today im disappointed that we couldnt make the 1 million donation to charity the childrens miracle network i let stanley tools down with that it was a great day for everybody and im looking forward in moving on to bristol next week
5098688 we tried a little bit of this and a little of that and nothing really got it the car going there at the end we made some changes that we knew would help on a short run and was able to finish in the top 10 the car was good all weekend we just couldnt get it really good when we needed it
5098689 we changed everything on the car that we could today to try and get our alltel dodge to drive better not the greatest finish but a pretty good rebound after we started dead last we were a 38th place car at the start of the race and almost brought home a top 20 well take it and head to bristol
5098690 weve got some work to do im not real happy with the car right now we had to start in the back of the field because of an engine change on saturday during practice ryan newman did a great job compensating and getting something out of race day by finishing 21st well be testing this week and see if we can improve on our package
5098691 yeah lap two i went down in there and the thing didnt even turn its frustrating because we werent having any real problems with push in the car yesterday
5098692 its just the fact that the track pavement is pretty old its pretty worn out theres not a lot of grip its still a high speed racetrack so goodyear brings a pretty hard tire which gives you way less grip and what it does it makes the margin of error very small so when you make small adjustments you can go overboard and thats what we did before the race we went overboard with trying to fix what we thought was going to be our biggest problem today and we made the other way be the biggest problem and we about made it to where we couldnt fix it we adjusted on it all day long and finally in the last fourth of the race or maybe 20 percent of the race we got it pretty good but it still needed something changed that we couldnt do on pit road we werent the only ones sliding around like patrick carpentier he ran really good had a good practice good qualifying looked good yesterday looked good the first half of the race they probably made some little adjustments trying to fix it a little bit trying to make their car into an eighth place car instead of 12th place car and they did something obviously just a little bit wrong that hurt their car pretty bad and didnt have a very good finish man its all in experience and communication and chemistry and knowing how much to go and the crew chief knowing how much to listen to the driver or not listen to the driver and how much impact that is the drivers trying to learn how much to tell the crew chief and the pit crew and the engineers on how much he needs and so on and so forth its all part of the learning process its a tough place and california will be just as tough its a two mile racetrack big long turns and those long turns go into big long straightaways and when youre slower through the turns it just kills your straightaway time again the margin of error is not very big next weeks margin of error at bristol is going to be really small were looking forward to that its my hometown its great racing its like going to a december game at lambeau field even without brett favre
5098693 the car was amazing at the beginning of the race was really fast it was actually easy to keep up with these guys and just started getting looser and looser and looser and got so loose from entry of the corner to exit i was sideways so i was kind of dirt tracking the whole race its just sad we had a good start and held on it for quite a while and didnt finish where we wanted i dont know what happened
5098694 the first 80 percent of the race the car was out of control the last two or three runs we could actually race around people we made a lot of changes during the race whatever we did the last two stops helped because we were able to race with other cars around us
5098695 were already in the experimental mode trying stuff and hoping to learn from it what we had for the setup here today was quite different from what we ran here back in june we used a completely different baseline we ran pretty much top 10 for the first half of the race when we started making adjustments that made our miller lite dodge loose in tight in the center and loose off we just got behind when we put spring rubbers in and bled the shocks we got back there in four wide traffic on a restart and cut down the left rear tire we had to pit twice under green lag racing and that just put a fitting end to our day
5098696 a tough day for our jim beam dodge we had a very good car here all weekend and to finish where we did is a little disappointing we had an electrical fire inside the car that burned the wiring near the tachometer i looked down and saw smoke coming from the dash then a puff of flame i grabbed my water bottle and poured it on the fire to put it out it was crazy
5098697 yeah i had a problem right when i pulled into the pits it happened real quick i did all that i could do in the car to see if there was anything wrong with the switches all the gauges looked good we just had something break inside the engine something real small but big enough to take us out
5098698 i dont know where well end up but i dont think that well get hurt too bad well probably drop to 11th or 12th maybe 13th were not going to be far from 12th its going to be very attainable to get into the chase well just have to have some good races
5098699 no warning at all i havent had an engine problem in three years at gillett evernham gillett evernham does a great job but something broke inside the engine that ended our day
5098700 we struggled with the handling on both cars we finally got decent with the 43 in the middle of the race but lost it there at the end and finished 27th it wasnt a very good day for either car
5098701 its nice to be able to redeem yourself in a seven day period
5098702 its funny hawley comes up to me before the final and says jack i want you to completely get out of your mind what happened last weekend dont even think about that i said frank we dont teach mind games at the school were not supposed to be doing that
5098703 imagine being a little league player and you get to pitch against mickey mantle frank hawley has been all of that to the sport to have him come back in adds a whole other dimension to this and hell no i wasnt going to cut him any slack
5098704 like the last thing we needed was another tough funny car i was so happy for him when he won his rounds and he was happy for me all the way up to the final round so that was cool it was just a fairy tale weekend it really was
5098705 the valvoline mts dodge guys gave me such a great consistent race car
5098706 a couple of times it wanted to move over toward the centerline but it was a pretty smooth car all weekend long didnt throw us any curve balls out there
5098707 crew chief johnny west is a very conservative by nature type of guy so he and assistant crew chief tommy delago balance each other well and i think now that weve been consistent for a few races were starting to get quick and i think if we can take that to cold weather tracks we will be contending for the championship
5098708 theres a lot of mixed emotions the valvoline mts dodge has been running really good its like austin coil john forces crew chief told me a long time ago everybody tells you youve done a real good job when you win weve been doing the same job we just finally had good results the biggest part is the entire schumacher group and all the people at the shop and the guys who build the chassis thats the nucleus of the whole operation i just came in and brought a little continuity and thats what probably helped make this thing turn the corner outside of that i really havent done anything different than what ive normally done my whole life
5098709 it feels really good we know what it feels like to win early on in the year and we know what it feels like to struggle quite a bit and have a little bit of a slump since johnny west has come on board and started working with ed ace mcculloch napa crew chief and theyve been working together it seems like things are making a turn for the better
5098710 for both tony and jack to come out on top and the teams do what theyre supposed to do was terrific what a bunch of fantastic people im fortunate enough to have and to have sponsors like the u s army valvoline and mail terminal services on board and matco tools and all our other great sponsors its a great weekend
5098711 pretty much so not quite what we were hoping for the track was a lot slicker than last time here all week and it was for everybody we just didnt make very good adjustments to go along with what we needed to do before the race started i thought we made good adjustments during the race to get the car back more competitive it wasnt terrible but we had a little higher hopes right here for michigan its just another race on the schedule i think we did get raybestos rookie of the race so thats good and we gained a little bit there stayed in the top 35 in the points so thats the two priority goals that we covered and i think we did probably learn some to help us for the next time around at this type of racetrack which will be california in a couple weeks we stayed out of trouble and sam did a good job doing that we didnt have very good pit stops were really struggling with that department and we havent made much gain we need to get better at that or we cant race in this league
5098712 its just the fact that the track pavement is pretty old its pretty worn out theres not a lot of grip its still a high speed racetrack so goodyear bring a pretty hard tire which gives you way less grip and what it does it makes the margin of error very small so when you make small adjustments you can go overboard and thats what we did before the race we went overboard with trying to fix what we thought was going to be our biggest problem today and we made the other way be the biggest problem and we bout made it to where we couldnt fix it we adjusted on it all day long and finally in the last fourth of the race or maybe 20 percent of the race we got it pretty good but it still needed something changed that we couldnt do on pit road we werent the only ones sliding around like patrick carpentier he ran really good had a good practice good qualifying looked good yesterday looked good the first half of the race they probably made some little adjustments trying to fix it a little bit trying to make their car into an eighth place car instead of 12th place car and they did something obviously just a little bit wrong that hurt their car pretty bad and didnt have a very good finish man its all in experience and communication and chemistry and knowing how much to go and the crew chief knowing how much to listen to the driver or not listen to the driver and how much impact that is the driver trying to learn how much to tell the crew chief and the pit crew and the engineers on how much he needs and so on and so forth its all part of the learning process its a tough place and california will be just as tough its a two mile racetrack big long turns and those long turns go into big long straightaways and when youre slower through the turns it just kills your straightaway time again the margin of error is not very big next weeks margin of error at bristol is going to be really small were looking forward to that its my hometown its great racing its like going to a december game at lambeau field even without brett favre

5098725 after one failed attempt to steal lead from its porch and roof at the second attempt the thieves were successful in removing large strips of lead work from the sloping roof of the church
5098726 looking at the site and taking into account the type of property i suggested an unobtrusive wire free intruder system which has been our speciality for a number of years since we required the technology to give coverage over the front and the rear roofs we selected the optex vx402r the larger back box enabling us to install an 868 wireless transmitter and allow the unit to operate at 3 volts
5098727 using wire free technology meant that we did not have to run cables through and around a historical building but this was not without its problems
5098728 the thick walls meant we had a weak signal and so we had to incorporate methods to boost the signals
5098729 in total we installed four units along with a number of high output sounder units
5098730 im happy to say that we have not had any false activations from these units we are located in a very rural part of the country and due to the amount of churches that are suffering with the ongoing threat of theft we shall be attending more churches in order to help them
5098731 where budgets are tight but reliability is still essential boundarygard provides an excellent front line defence against intruders and the flexibility of having wireless detectors means that they can be installed even in the most challenging of environments
5098732 installers effectively now have a product that they can use outdoors that provides the same high performance detection they have come to expect from the detectors they use inside their homes
5098733 jag hoppas p en bra start p en hektisk vecka
5098734 i dreamt i went to the doctors and she gave me eight minutes to live id been sitting in the f ing waiting room half an hour
5098735 id been listening to mahlers third symphony which starts off by describing what the rocks tell me i loved the idea of speaking rocks
5098736 then each of the following movements ascends up the scale of being until we learn what love tells me all this inspired me to write a piece that has a similar evolutionary narrative
5098737 my piece starts with a sense of a paradisal innocence which is broken by a babys scream this is the moment of incarnation when the human spirit descends down to earth and takes on a bodily existence to begin with language hasnt yet become articulate its as if the instruments are cooing and gurgling
5098738 it comes out of ircams long running project to analyse speech and then digitally synthesise it
5098739 its a difficult task because the physics of consonants and vowels is hugely complex one spin off of this research is new software that can impose these speech formants as theyre called onto other sounds in my new piece ive used this software to create the sense that instruments are speaking and singing simultaneously
5098740 and what really interests me is combining those rhythms and melodies with the purely musical melodies ive composed its really a different way of thinking about polyphony
5098741 it becomes very calm and sustained as if all the instruments are singing the same chant im aiming at a state someone once described as a gregorian paradise its the moment of transcendence a loss of self when everything merges together
5098742 well i started as a christian and ive never officially left
5098743 i dont see a contradiction between them they both lead to the spiritual realm which music does too in its own way i often have the sense that in great music you can feel underneath the busy surface something still and calm which never changes you could call it the music behind the music thats what im searching for
5098744 an almost limitless amount of money could be spent in this case on the health system
5098745 when you limit it then you set up the need to make choices and sometimes those choices are very difficult and very painful
5098746 it is crushingly disappointing for anybody for whatever reason who has pinned their hopes on a new treatment and so we dont take these decisions lightly and its why we take great care and sometimes why we take longer than people would like to make those decisions
5098747 it shouldnt make any difference where you live there ought to be a common basis for making decisions about exceptional circumstances and i think anybody who uses the nhs for their care is entitled to expect that
5098748 what they need to do is to find out from those who are making the decision what the basis of that decision is and if they dont think its reasonable if they dont think it compares appropriately with decisions that are taken elsewhere ask why not
5098749 pharmaceutical companies have enjoyed double digit growth year on year and they are out to sustain that not least because their senior managements earnings are related to the share price
5098750 its not in their interests to take less profits personally as well as from the point of view of the business all these incentives drive the price up
5098751 the problem lies less with the fact of nice having to undertake cost effectiveness evaluations and more with the failure of the government to ensure that the price paid for new cancer drugs reflects their clinical value
5098752 it is really for the government to explain why new cancer drugs are far more available elsewhere in europe and america than they are through the nhs in this country
5098753 but it really didnt kind of get on the front burner until sometime within the last seven days
5098754 deadline must have been earlier than the decision than when we started to get serious about making the decision

5098760 some of the big carriers tout their ptt services but they have the carrier barrier limitation of locking their customers into their networks and only the handsets the carriers support

5098775 the rule of friendship means there should be mutual sympathy between them each supplying what the other lacks and trying to benefit the other always using friendly and sincere words

5098786 the pain started in my calf and seemed to come up into my quads i stopped to stretch it but it came back it wasnt sharp pain i would have stopped if it was but i just couldnt use it it was like running on one leg
5098787 i just really wanted to finish its frustrating because i was really comfortable i just couldnt go any quicker cardiovascularly i was ok
5098788 that was the real frustration we knew it was a gamble but i couldnt watch the olympic marathon on tv
5098789 i am absolutely going to carry on until london yes marathon is one event when you can continue when you are older constantina is 38 and the support i would have in london would really help
5098790 if i felt i was really doing damage i would have stopped
5098791 but it is horrible when you have to drop out especially when it is the olympic games so many people have worked hard to get me here and in some ways it is quicker to keep going because you are just left out there on your own if you stop somewhere i did as much as i could at every point i just needed more time
5098792 its clearly not possible to say when negotiations will be concluded
5098793 there are so many sides to it no 1 im excited as could be as any jets fan it certainly gives you a feeling that you could do almost anything theres a lot to be played out here and of course i want to see things go well believe me but its harder its gonna be awful hard for him
5098794 i really gave this a lot of thought the newness of the situation its hard to discard so much newness and the frenzy and so much focus on brett brett being the veteran he is and a great player maybe he can do that but theres so much newness going on that the mind doesnt get enough focus on the football part of course i question you know this team was a 4 12 team last year theyve got to play their butts off to help him he just left a team that the last two seasons was a mighty fine team he has to get a lot of help from his team to excel
5098795 its going to be a struggle for him its entirely on the team thats why its we win championships not i the jets have got to grow up as a team in order for him to excel this season
5098796 it could be a problem yes it is a problem its not second nature to him its going to be a while before he gets comfortable with the jets offense
5098797 is it to win a championship this year well i sure hope we do

5099135 the games are perverted the olympic ideal is sacrificed to propaganda that is utterly untrue the magnificent success of the berlin games served perfectly the idea of the olympics the fact that the games in 1936 are illuminated by hitler strength and discipline we should wish that the games would always be so well organized

5099140 we believe mac performance is due to several unique drivers that were not present in prior downturns we anticipate that apple will continue to grow at a multiple of the overall market for many years to come
5099141 first apple has successfully reduced the perceived and actual switching costs for windows users looking to adopt the mac platform second apples support of the intel architecture has levelled the playing field in terms of speeds and feeds comparisons between macs and pcs finally apples successful retail strategy has broadened the availability of mac products and given apple more control over the critical computer selling process users can now explore the advantages of the mac platform with highly trained apple sales reps

5099151 we were down in huntsville alabama we finished praying immediately the owners came out and changed the gas prices they brought it down we had marvellous success down in st louis missouri
5099152 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5099153 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5099154 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5099155 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5099156 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5099157 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5099158 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5099164 since i was 17 years old i have been performing on the opry circuit in texas
5099165 to be acknowledged by the grand ole opry and asked to perform is such an honor
5099166 which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity
5099167 i got a new album coming out in the later part of the year
5099168 because music is my life so i wasnt going to quit
5099169 we were like a big family and i would say above the mason dixon line motown got it
5099170 he got upset and struck the mother in the face one or two times on the left cheek which caused some bruising
5099171 i think a lot of people felt definitely for this particular ad it looked like loreal had pretty much whitewashed beyonce
5099172 a lot of african american celebrities dont want to speak out about this because they dont want to be seen as playing the race card
5099173 if beyonce wants to be silent on her personal life i can understand
5099174 if theres something that has been misconstrued set the record straight so we can learn from it

5099184 they arrived late friday night early saturday morning and immediately make a call to our undercover officer to make the meet
5099185 we had them come to a house and park the car they had driven up we call it a load car they wanted a place where they could dismantle the car where they had hidden the narcotics in the car
5099186 i think the club lost a bit of momentum last season which is understandable when youve had the same manager for eight years and he suddenly leaves
5099187 the club has grown and developed year on year and i see the money that i have been given to strengthen the squad as a vote of confidence in me to continue that development and a signal that we are all pulling in the same direction
5099188 i have been given money to try to take the club forward but there has never been any argument about the players i want to bring in there is a trust there that im thankful for
5099189 we were 3 0 down in the blink of an eye
5099190 but we got some pride back in the second half you dust yourself down try and correct a few little things and look forward to the next game
5099191 i said come on then lets go one better she didnt really react by that stage she was totally focused on the job i could have told her that her hair was on fire and she would have just sat there
5099192 im gutted for the crew truly gutted they deserved to win it did spur me on a little bit but at that point i was in the zone only concerned about my own performance
5099193 i was shouting to shane sutton britains chief coach was it me was it me when he said id won i still didnt believe it
5099194 to become olympic champion puts you on a different level to everyone else
5099195 when youre one of the best athletes in your country you feel great but when you come here youre mixing it with thousands of the best athletes in the world and youre nothing until you become olympic champion
5099196 i couldnt put myself through that stress again im happy with my lot besides i was never good at any sports i dont think im that good at riding a bike its just hard work and determination that has got me here at least ill be able to relax now i didnt want to carry on for another four years fighting and fighting for that one step further now ill just see what limits i can push myself to as a bike rider to see if i can be like bradley wiggins or chris hoy that would be the ultimate
5099197 dan has been with me from the beginning and has got me through the toughest times
5099198 i definitely wouldnt be in this position if it wasnt for him the thing i was most gutted about was not being able to share the experience with him at the very last hurdle
5099199 im going to be in a position where all the other athletes have medalled
5099200 my motivation will be to make sure that im not the loser in the team
5099201 we have a great model a great system theres good camaraderie in the squad and nobody wants to be a failure we have the best of everything and thats why it works ive been involved in two of the top sports and theyre worlds apart uk sport should look at the success were having and model it if other sports dont learn from us were not going to dominate at the london games
5099202 people have been writing things that just arent true trying to unsettle the whole club but all that crap weve had to suffer weve just dispelled in 90 minutes of football thats what makes it all the more sweet for me
5099203 i was disappointed with the fans reaction towards moyesy because people forget what a great man he has been for everton
5099204 he doesnt deserve that on the first game of the season
5099205 the whole city is buzzing and its a wonderful thing for anybody involved in sport to see what a positive impact a successful club can have on a once blighted city
5099206 its a tribute to the vision of the council who built the stadium and to the management of peter taylor who built a competitive side to get us promoted we found our level in the championship until some new money came in and that made the difference in getting promoted last year
5099207 weve got two quality strikers and that will help us through the season
5099208 its a 38 game season not a one game season and we go away and lick our wounds all this proves is that there are no easy games
5099209 you can see tottenham without berbatov are a different team
5099210 but i dont think his head is there anymore its not with spurs and i think he is looking for a move
5099211 if he leaves then tottenham will sign big strikers and big names because that is what they need to satisfy the supporters
5099212 but how do you replace berbatov its very difficult he is a class player plays his own game every game and he is not affected by anything around him it will be especially difficult for spurs after losing robbie keano is one of the best players i have ever played with losing him i think will turn out to be even more difficult for spurs
5099213 it is up to manchester united to make a bid and spurs to accept or decline it or whatever the ball is in our court really because he is our player the chairman will decide what to do if he stays or if he goes
5099214 he has shown that he is an intelligent player with a good technique who can integrate well with the rest of the team
5099215 im the type of person where i cant stop doing things one thing always leads to another
5099216 i was wrapped in bandages and everyone said great costume
5099217 i think the cuisine has a lot of potential here
5099218 there are no famous indonesian chefs here yet id like to be the first one
5099219 if all the world were to call you hermogenes that would not be your name

5099226 nunca he posado desnuda o en topless estoy segura de que si hay algunas fotos de m ser n en un bikini en vacaciones pero eso es todo
5099227 i uncritically quoted a source that may actually have been correct
5099228 mr mccain relies on his chief domestic policy adviser douglas holtz eakin the former
5099229 how significant was gramms role in formulating your economic plan and is there any chance that he would be your secretary of treasury or play a significant economic policy making role in a mccain administration
5099230 heres my chance to say im not at all surprised by this it was only a matter of time
5099231 the police are leaving too i guess it was not big deal after all
5099232 your cars not starting right your battery may be going out
5099233 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5099234 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5099235 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5099236 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5099237 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5099238 its better to have a large crew on scene to do the investigation in a timely manner
5099239 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5099240 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5099241 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5099242 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5099243 one small step for man one giant leap for mankind
5099244 there is no such notion anymore in georgia as russian peacekeepers
5099245 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5099246 mr de la hoya however has shown little interest by offering me a percentage that only an up and coming fighter rightly deserves
5099247 if he really wants the fight then he should at least at the very least give me what i truly deserve a fair share of the pie he should understand that we are both superstars in the game and our mere names will sell everything and we stand to break all existing records in the sport even the one that he established with floyd mayweather jr
5099248 i just want to tell him does he understand whats on the table and is the comparison between fighting oscar and junior lightweight humberto soto worth the risk

5099303 we just wanted to come out enjoy the day see a few golfers and see if we can get him a few autographs
5099304 it basically says that this was the right move the triad has responded very positively about our move back here and wanted to see what it was all about
5099305 they came bought their tickets and were happy to have them all out here
5099306 we figured that we were going to have more fans out here so we definitely beefed up our gallery patrol and security our folks in security are all over
5099307 the pga tour works with us very close and they have their own security team theyre very happy with the way weve handled this

5099309 was largely a retrospective construction something that would not have been recognizable to most people at the time
5099310 whats going on in the minds of the five million americans who have graduated college since hiroshima
5099311 the difficulty is that the same marginalization of the holocaust in consciousness took place in the yishuv the jewish community of palestine more than half of whose members had left europe since 1933
5099312 go into ecstasies about some local party political affair while the murder of the jews of europe is reported only in the inside pages
5099313 devoted 2 or 3 percent of his 1 200 page book to the murder of european jewry a proportion that to the best of my knowledge no critic commented on
5099314 the holocaust has proven to be an indispensable ideological weapon
5099315 holocaust awareness is an official propagandistic indoctrination a churning out of slogans and a false view of the world the real aim of which is not at all an understanding of the past but a manipulation of the present
5099316 the appearance of the holocaust as a guest subject on episodes of a wide array of american televisions series including the defenders star trek the fbi all in the family seventh heaven er the x files has made the subject a familiar element of the nations repertoire of moral issues
5099317 no other event in modern history looms so large in our nations moral landscape that did not either take place in this country or involve large numbers of americans abroad
5099318 those enjoying this immunity have not escaped the moral corruptions that typically attend it
5099319 economics by john mccain support george bush 95 percent of a time keep spending 10 billion a month for a war in iraq while a iraqis sell oil for record prices giving iraq a 79 billion oil surplus amp hurting our economy
5099320 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5099321 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5099322 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

5099326 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5099327 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5099328 your cars not starting right your battery may be going out
5099329 as more and more information is collected and kept on all of us we are very concerned that appropriate safeguards go along with that
5099330 people should know what is happening with their information and have a choice
5099331 our concern is that what is kept with the justification of preventing and detecting terrorism can then be used for minor purposes such as pursuing people for parking fines
5099332 the fact that engineers two cubicles apart send an e mail rather than get up and talk the whole nature of sitting down and hashing out ideas and collaborating is a bit stymied by the construct of the cubicles

5099363 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5099364 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5099365 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5099366 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5099367 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5099368 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5099369 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5099370 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5099371 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5099372 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5099373 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5099374 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5099375 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5099376 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5099377 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5099378 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5099379 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5099380 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5099381 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

5099390 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5099391 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5099392 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5099393 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5099394 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
5099395 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5099396 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5099397 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5099398 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5099399 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5099400 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5099401 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5099402 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5099403 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5099404 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5099405 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5099406 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5099407 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5099408 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5099409 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5099410 who are open to doing something on the production side
5099411 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5099412 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5099413 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5099414 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5099415 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5099416 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5099417 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5099418 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5099419 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5099420 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5099421 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5099422 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5099423 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5099424 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5099425 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5099426 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5099427 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5099428 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5099429 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5099430 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5099431 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5099432 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5099433 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5099434 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5099435 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5099436 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve

5099450 i dont think ed balls has any concept of how damaging he has been to this school he should have been in the hall last night when my staff were expecting 150 parents to the new year seven evening and got 50 he should have been in that hall when i had to tell the pupils their school wasnt going to shut down in 50 days
5099451 in my nigerian school i couldnt talk to a teacher you asked too many questions and they beat you
5099452 cynthia isnt one in a thousand most kids here have a story this school gets a rough ride but is getting better
5099453 there were very very dark days when my eldest boy was told hed come here i nearly had a nervous breakdown no way did i want him here there would be 10 to 15 police vans outside the school how could i let my boy go into that but now thats starting to change its very gradual
5099454 its not difficult you need three things to turn a school around sort the behaviour out sort the teaching out then give it some time you cant get these kids through english gcse in a year you need five years of sustained work thats what the government doesnt understand
5099455 i didnt have a specialist at that time and so i was a bit in limbo

5099457 its probably easier to get drugs off fat charlie round the back of the bus station than it is to get medicines but there we are
5099458 the evidence is absolutely clear that the extent of the benefits and the numbers of patients involved as such that it isnt the right decision for the health service to make treatment available until patients as they inevitably will move into the moderate stage of the disease
5099459 i feel particularly angry on behalf of early onset patients because it feels like an insult and the younger you are the more insulting it is
5099460 a lot of people with early onset have got dependents both younger and older and theyre trying to hold down a job
5099461 it is a really nasty disease and i cannot imagine cancer patients being denied a drug like this in similar circumstances

5099496 i would prefer to see a model which had smaller ethics commissions or anti corruption bodies with oversight over specific areas like police for example or perhaps even the conduct of executive government
5099497 my stay in iraq has opened my eyes to just how brutal a country we are we came into this country like a football player back handing a 2 year old for his lollipop we left nothing untouched that had even the slightest effect on the outcome of the war weapons of mass destruction yeah right whatever george
5099498 our products are not like other fish emulsions and do not have an offensive odor to them because the source is so fresh and our process is so thorough because we are growing catfish for food production we rigorously control how they are fed which ensures a stable source of quality and consistency required by consumers
5099499 we are very excited to be able to offer a concentrated organic fertilizer that has similar performance characteristics to synthetics or chemical fertilizers having 100 omri certified organic products that work well on almost every landscape and is safe for family and pets is something that our customers have been requesting for some time
5099500 a vote is like a rifle its usefulness depends upon the character of the user
5099501 there is a religious cultural dimension they are outcasts from their families and find succour in drugs ruffies rohypnol a date rape drug benzedrine an amphetamine cough syrup
5099502 i come from a religious family and i know what i am doing is a sin but i pray every day for god to create an opportunity for me to leave this business not just me but all the girls
5099503 grew up with it the idea is sold to you from six or eight its a way of life the girls see it as a rite of passage soon ill be on my own independent grown up
5099504 men made the vast majority of decisions in the household regarding not only major life issues such as large purchases but also more mundane matters such as daily purchases and meals sexual debut was often unwanted and traumatic for these young brides
5099505 a girl can be married at 12 and divorced at 18 with children to support
5099506 the way you change a car is the way you change a wife in kano you give birth to a few children and you can find yourself divorced for the slightest excuse
5099507 the north is a very traditional place to make inroads you must work with traditional religious leaders
5099508 what we dont have yet is many traditional leaders coming out to promote condoms a number of them have come to terms with the fact that people are having sex and were thankful that weve had some kind of silent support which hasnt opposed the intervention
5099509 i dont jump to conclusions only god will judge who goes to hell or heaven
5099510 how long do you think it would take to kill all 150 of us it would be a bloodbath
5099511 when you have good guys with guns the bad guys do less damage
5099512 weve had a very disturbing trend of school shootings in the us
5099513 it is my belief this is caused by making schools gun free zones when schools were made gun free zones they became targets for people who wanted to rack up the body count
5099514 its up there with the worst ideas in the history of education
5099515 you could have a gun accidentally taken away or a gun could be dislodged or discharged while a teachers breaking up a fight in the cafeteria
5099516 allowing armed staff and teachers will provide a last line of defence if other security measures at the school fail
5099517 officers cant be everywhere and in an emergency every second counts
5099518 when you hear about these shootings the reports always start out with this is a sleepy little place nobody thought this would ever happen here
5099519 there were kids running around and finally they got tired of that and just watched the film and were completely transfixed
5099520 i remember thinking where else are they going to see that not on tv and i thought how easy it would be to infiltrate that kind of stuff into childrens lives
5099521 a week later i got a prize and a bonus from a film studio that exactly covered it
5099522 and attention to the project itself people are taking it seriously
5099523 you can see films like this in paris and now you can see them in nairn
5099524 if you come in a kilt for powell and pressburgers i know where im going you can come in free
5099525 and when im off on sundays i miss all his undies
5099526 i would have switched it off if it had been on telly but actually i quite enjoyed it
5099527 usually going to the cinema now is all about guarantees did it get good reviews how is it doing at the box office will i get comfortable seats and be able to buy toxic waste sweets
5099528 going to a restaurant that you trust and saying feed me people are coming not because they know all the films we are showing but out of trust people have said its like going to the pictures as a child being taken and told you are going to love this and you know anyone can do this all you need is some dvds and a space
5099529 for once you can happily look around and actually make eye contact with people its the shared enthusiasm thats so compelling
5099530 people are mystified it makes it very much easier for selective schools which dont face the problems those in the national challenge face to get specialist status and extra funding
5099531 it is a new unfairness added to the wider unfairness of the 30 floor target in the national challenge
5099532 its undoubted that being in the national challenge will have damaged schools despite the best intentions the effect of being threatened with closure will impact on these schools for years to come
5099533 we recognise the concern the dcsfs decision will cause some schools but we are confident many of them will meet the floor target consideration will also be given to those that demonstrate good progress towards the target
5099534 we are not taking away these schools specialist status or the associated funding we have postponed their redesignation until after their 2008 gcse results are known but they remain part of the specialist schools programme weve never called these schools failing many are improving are on the right track and are doing a good job for their local communities
5099535 it definitely helped us being at the last olympics athens 2004 we knew what to do this time
5099536 now just as you accepted christ jesus as your lord you must continue to follow him let your roots grow down into him and let your lives be built on him then your faith will grow strong in the truth you were taught and you will overflow with thankfulness
5099537 dont let anyone capture you with empty philosophies and high sounding nonsense that come from human thinking and from the spiritual powers of this world rather than from christ
5099538 therefore take up the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done everything you can do to stand
5099539 for he knows how we are formed he remembers that we are dust
5099540 he does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities
5099541 all men will hate you because of me but he who stands firm to the end will be saved
5099542 in god whose word i praise in god i trust i will not be afraid what can mortal man do to me
5099543 as for me i watch in hope for the lord i wait for god my savior my god will hear me do not gloat over me my enemy though i have fallen i will rise though i sit in darkness the lord will be my light
5099544 no you havent seen oh my god until youve seen this

5099556 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5099557 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5099558 any of the various procedures including the prescription dispensing and administration of any drug or the performance of any procedure or any other action that results in the termination of life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth whether before or after implantation
5099559 the speed and weight of money behind this move has been quite breathtaking
5099560 commodity booms end ugly they always do and there has never been an exception
5099561 this downswing is more consistent with the global economic fundamentals
5099562 the commodity markets are more central to australian national income than either credit markets or share markets
5099563 prices for our commodity exports are still at generational highs and ongoing demand from emerging economies give us some cause for optimism despite slowing global growth
5099564 you hate the jazz critics dont you jack youre so militant about it i dont think you need to worry you know theyll get old and die soon and well be the new guard and itll be fine so fuck it
5099565 we freezed our arses solid and only made a fiver
5099566 wed spend friday nights in our flat with five or six laptops going with me painting the covers
5099567 it misleadingly suggests evolutionary development in fact the groups work is as traditionally hook based as anything from rock to hip hop to systems music and decisively downplays anything resembling unpredictably free associative playing
5099568 why would we after all we love hooks we recognise the same kind of things in a kings of leon record as we do in a branford marsalis quartet record thats an awesome melody thats a nice bassline thats a kicking beat
5099569 take us living together playing together its like an indie rock band formula in a lot of jazz youre a composer who picks the artists you want to work with were best mates which makes the chemistry between us really different
5099570 you get the best out of people theyre not coming to see you theyre not expecting to see you so when they stop ask questions and stick around it says everything
5099571 if you can make music for yourself that still communicates thats the ideal
5099572 and if buskings not direct communication i dont know what is
5099573 ellen and portia came out and posed for pictures with ellens mom and their two dogs they were hugging and kissing and looked ecstatic ellen was helping portia with the train of her dress which looked like a cinderella tutu
5099574 its is always in your mind from when you get up until you go to bed
5099575 no one will do anything for us we just have to make the best of it
5099576 i was given assurances when i bought my property that defences would be maintained
5099577 as we got there a twin engined aircraft came over our heads flying quite low enough for us to notice and look up
5099578 literally as we watched it come over our heads more or less like a flash what i almost thought was a microlight came across and the twin engined plane smashed into it straight on and totally destroyed it it just fell apart as if it was made of balsa wood it was unbelievable
5099579 the twin engined aircraft banked heavily to the left and i think its right propeller came off
5099580 we thought it was trying to recover you are just thinking go on it seemed to get its height back for a little bit but then it nose dived into the trees we heard a deep rumble as it obviously crashed
5099581 i saw a plane travelling east coming down sharply straight towards the woods
5099582 i immediately thought it looked like something was wrong then at the last minute just 50 feet up the pilot managed to pull up the nose of the plane it looked like he was trying to save the plane from the trees but then i realised the plane was going down
5099583 this is the most difficult issue we are going to face as an agency
5099584 we know the sea is eating away at the coast in quite a number of places primarily but not totally exclusively on the east and south coasts its a particularly huge issue in east anglia but in quite a number of other areas as well
5099585 level best to try to defend communities where there are significant numbers of properties under threat and where its possible to find engineering solutions
5099586 we are almost certainly not going to be able to defend absolutely every bit of coast it would simply be an impossible task both in financial terms and engineering terms
5099587 we will publish next year details of the work thats been done where we think the particular threats are where we think there is current defence in place we will begin to talk with communities where we think defence is not a viable option
5099588 we need to start having a serious discussion with government about what options can be put in place
5099589 the increases in volume of air traffic and the consequent increases in congestion on the ground are from the analysis that weve done pretty unavoidable
5099590 i think the government is making a mistake and i will carry on telling them that i think they are making a mistake
5099591 my view would be that we should not go ahead with the development of a new coal fired generation unless those clean coal technologies are in place and we can clean up the emissions
5099592 im arresting you on suspicion for assisting suicide and manslaughter
5099593 remarkable degree of mutual trust and expectation that characterises scandinavian social relations
5099594 hot wheels are better than real cars i can afford them
5099595 this has grown into something bigger than i ever dreamed
5099596 its like a family we all get together and have a good time
5099597 when i buy hot wheels i have to buy three of everything
5099598 this is a good family experience and a fairly inexpensive way to spend the afternoon
5099599 barcelona is the leading example of a city that has got its leaders together and focused on what it wants to be known for
5099600 to a lesser extent liverpool is doing this its decided it wants to be a hip city and it has a plan to achieve it on the other hand leeds and sheffield have similar brand potential but its yet to be developed in a coordinated way
5099601 all anthropologists who want to be part of the revolution in scholarly communication must do so outside of the aaa
5099602 the american anthropological association reminds me of the recording industry
5099603 weve come to a mutual conclusion on what we shall present to the leaders of the coalition government
5099604 once they have cleared it we will be presenting it as part of a resolution and charge sheet in the joint houses and god willing that should happen this week
5099605 this year the pilgrimage was nice except for the iskandariya incident
5099606 my greatest moral failing and i am a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
5099607 perhaps we have not devoted ourselves to causes greater than our self interest although weve been the best at it

5099610 tapi rabbku tidak akan menerimanya jika aku menangguhkan waktu shalat dari waktu yang telah ditentukan
5099611 laki laki yang tidak dilalaikan oleh perniagaan dan tidak pula oleh jual beli dari mengingat allah mendirikan shalat dan membayarkan zakat mereka takut pada suatu hari yang di hari itu hati dan penglihatan menjadi goncang mereka mengerjakan yang demikian itu supaya allah memberi balasan kepada mereka dengan balasan yang lebih baik dari apa yang telah mereka kerjakan dan supaya allah menambah karunia nya kepada mereka dan allah memberi rezki kepada siapa yang dikehendaki nya tanpa batas
5099612 kami sekali kali tidak mengutamakan kamu daripada bukti bukti yang nyata mujizat yang telah datang kepada kami dan daripada rabb yang menciptakan kami maka putuskanlah apa yang hendak kamu putuskan sesungguhnya kamu hanya akan dapat memutuskan pada kehidupan di dunia ini saja

5099615 being 3 000 miles away doing a film when someone gets sick
5099616 we really wanted an opportunity to not only get new audience here but to get audience s back so that was great we felt like it was a total success
5099617 we hope to draw six to ten thousand people down here and a lot of these folks have never been to downtown its all about introducing people to what we have down here so were really excited
5099618 i think more people than ever now are turning to concealed carry permits in the hope that no matter who gets in this election theyll still be allowed to keep their permits
5099619 there were kids running around and finally they got tired of that and just watched the film and were completely transfixed
5099620 i remember thinking where else are they going to see that not on tv and i thought how easy it would be to infiltrate that kind of stuff into childrens lives

5099634 we want him to defend himself not just dump us and leave once and for all he should answer all those questions
5099635 we want political stability and the governments focus should be on the peoples betterment
5099636 i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
5099637 would have serious consequences on relations between russia and the european union
5099638 people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
5099639 we have to invent a new language with regard to russia that is what the european union is trying to do
5099640 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since august 7
5099641 begin the withdrawal of the military contingent moved to reinforce russian peacekeepers after the georgian aggression against south ossetia
5099642 georgia will never give up a square kilometre of its territory
5099643 how long do you think it would take to kill all 150 of us it would be a bloodbath
5099644 when you have good guys with guns the bad guys do less damage
5099645 weve had a very disturbing trend of school shootings in the us

5099647 its up there with the worst ideas in the history of education

5099649 allowing armed staff and teachers will provide a last line of defence if other security measures at the school fail

5099651 when you hear about these shootings the reports always start out with this is a sleepy little place nobody thought this would ever happen here
5099652 recent amendments to the sex discrimination act in april have strengthened the protection from sex discrimination not just at work but also in the wider world from businesses who discriminate against individuals in the goods and services they offer
5099653 where a man and woman have the same haircut and the same skills are required the salon is acting unlawfully to charge them different prices there does not appear to be any justification for the cost difference
5099654 where the service is truly the same so should the price

5099656 a careful respected lawyer with a fine record in prosecuting inhumane argentinian generals
5099657 we are concerned about the phenomena of burn out among experienced investigators who have left the office since 2005
5099658 there are simply not enough to handle the rigorous demands of these investigations and there is the perception that their efforts are not sufficiently valued
5099659 i have a strong case that is why i am appealing the judgment
5099660 i came out of the press conference in a state of shock
5099661 he painted a picture no scholar would recognise he was basically calling for regime change making a political statement which is surprising coming from the chief prosecutor of the icc
5099662 by presenting his case in such stark terms the prosecutor has made it easy for his critics to dismiss him as ill informed and driven by a desire for publicity and has made it harder for the advocates of justice in darfur to pursue the challenge of calling to account those responsible for crimes no less heinous than genocide
5099663 no one knows what my evidence is let the judges decide
5099664 after the construction of the road the number of trekkers will be reduced we have a trade off here between economic development and infrastructure and the effect on tourism and the environment we need to create alternative attractions to just trekking
5099665 we are trying to create man made tourism attractions like theme parks adrenaline sports like bungee jumping and rafting
5099666 will mainly go to a few specialised tour operators and some more expensive hotels
5099667 although there will be some trickle down of profits for the majority of the local people these activities will have little effect on alleviating poverty
5099668 there will be buses and tractors and lorries churning out their choking fumes all day and all night is this the way we want to treat our planet
5099669 students who dont cheat seem to be in the minority and have plenty of opportunities to see their peers cheat and receive the rewards with little risk of punishment
5099670 we see avoiding cheating as a form of everyday heroism in an academic setting
5099671 repeat offenders travelling from country to country and flagrantly avoiding the stringent sex offender mechanisms in the uk
5099672 many of them have been teachers or volunteers in orphanages
5099673 currently schools and organisations abroad have no mechanism for undertaking pre employment checks for checking the suitability of working with children through uk criminal records or other sources this is a major gap in the protection of vulnerable children
5099674 offenders are always trying to find new ways to access vulnerable children the easiest way to do that is to get into the school or orphanage system once youve got a job youve got an employment history and can travel from country to country
5099675 by not allowing international organisations access to the information we hold we are putting children at risk and allowing offenders to operate without fear
5099676 there is something fundamentally wrong about the current attitude to risk and harm to children abroad when these figures are shown side by side
5099677 this sends a strong message to so called sex tourists that they wont get away with targeting other countries with less strict controls than the uk
5099678 from the autumn we also intend to make registered sex offenders notify the police of any travel abroad presently sex offenders have to notify police if they will be abroad for three days or more
5099679 this used to be our territory this is our territory and this will be our territory in future
5099680 it will be part of an independent country within the russian federation
5099681 these are the mountains that have always surrounded georgia and protected it from invaders its been like that for centuries now im sad i dont have any desire to join an association with russia
5099682 we did perform some cleaning operations we were looking for fighters
5099683 why are you journalists not reporting about the civilians killed in the georgian attack on tskhinvali we have georgian soldiers whose bodies have been lying there a week their government doesnt care about them
5099684 this is a very beautiful place no wonder russia wants it
5099685 this place is peaceful nobody needs to be afraid but if there are problems we have lots of tanks
5099686 i worked the last two years in tskhinvali as an engineer
5099687 we know about them said koba subeliani an mp responsible for internally displaced persons
5099688 they want to exchange them for our hostages the problem is we dont have any hostages so we cant do any exchange
5099689 i was detained as i walked down the street on august 8
5099690 i think they want to exchange us for kidnapped ossetians
5099691 no i helped build a sports centre in tskhinvali we are peaceful people
5099692 he started a genocide against the ossetian and georgian peoples
5099693 we estimate 500 ossetian civilians were kidnapped and taken away by georgian forces from the south of tskhinvali
5099694 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5099695 the ship would be pushed by the spatial bubble and the bubble would be travelling faster than the speed of light
5099696 the problem with this and previous schemes including my own is that part of the exotic matter would have to travel faster than the local speed of light roughly speaking it would need to go faster than the speed of light with respect to the portion of space it occupies and thats not allowed by any established physical theory
5099697 the hardest part of community journalism is also the most rewarding part we live within what we write about either we know what we report or we are called on the carpet within hours if not minutes to account for our mistakes we look our stories in the face every day we meet them eye to eye and if we deny their humanity if we feel no compassion then we have failed to grasp the storys essence and will fail the storys telling
5099698 at a time when we hunger for authenticity for words which have meaning in our lives for stories which are of us about us not thrust upon us community journalists have both the privilege and the responsibility of beginning at the very root of the human experience and of lifting it up bringing it to light well done and god knows ive seen it done poorly this is an honorable profession and a necessary one and that is what i would tell young students today
5099699 ive never used cocaine i wouldnt know what it looks like
5099700 it was incredibly close the only thing i could say about the photo finish was oh oh not again i thought the photo was between me and sherone for third but it wasnt i put what i had on the line today im not upset 10 78 was a great time
5099701 that was my fault i should have gotten out of the blocks
5099702 im just going to focus on my next race and dont worry about this one i feel so great i thought one of us would be in the mix it was a fine tune up for my 200
5099703 i thought i moved before the gun i kind of hesitated because i expected to hear a second gun it threw me off a lot its pretty tough
5099704 i just placed ninth in the i almost said ncaa finals in the olympic final when i saw the ar next to my name it hit me
5099705 i felt good i had trouble closing the gap between the girl in front of me i had a pretty good kick that last lap i just couldnt turn to the next gear im disappointed but all in all it has been a good season
5099706 i felt really great on my race i felt strong afterwards im happy to be in the finals im in great shape im close to running a 48 im prepared to do that the stadium is incredible
5099707 yes and no im disappointed i tried to make it to the final but it didnt happen that way i cant be too disappointed ive had a great year and the year isnt over yet i dont know what happened today i went out there and gave it my all my plan is to be on the relay
5099708 its been a tough few days right up until tuesday my knee was fine come tuesday my knee started going downhill i was competing with a swollen knee right now todays race i gave it my all im not disappointed if it was any year that i wasnt going to be here this was it
5099709 it was so close going into today i had my strategy going in but things didnt fall into place there was a lot of pushing a lot of boxing i thought i had to dig deep to get in i didnt make it though life goes on as long as i gave my best my friends my family i didnt let them down i gave my best i knew it would be competitive i warmed up really good sadly it didnt work out
5099710 the pace was kind of slow i gave a great effort i tried to lead the pack it was really aggressive we just went out and i just kind of lost it mentally i blew it in the last lap
5099711 i got off really slow i had the flu last night and just didnt react i had to play catch up well see what happens i felt flat today theres no excuse it is what it is
5099712 it was surprisingly easy for me i ran exactly what i was going for i was just trying to make it through healthy i was a little nervous when i first came out but when i got into the blocks i calmed down
5099713 its like an all out dog fight im still kind of nervous i have to keep telling myself to calm down i want to have a complete race
5099714 my coach wanted me to run a good technical race i was able to do that im trying to peak at the right time everything is coming together at the right time i trust my coach im just following his plan
5099715 i had a lot of problems with my stride pattern its anyones race i hit that third hurdle and lost my focus
5099716 i had to push a little at the end it was faster that i thought it would be im not sure what happened in the heats i have a lot left in my tank i have to get mentally prepared

5099725 unfortunately its one of those cases where we may never know

5099751 this is especially true for low income youth for youth in the juvenile justice and child welfare systems ethnic minority youth and those with drug alcohol problems

5099753 the ecocert label is a mark that represents superior quality of product

5099756 i had been doing my lawn and dug it out accidentally with a digger it was a big round circle with a tiny dark tunnel leading off it which seems to go quite far
5099757 my children couldnt believe it when we found it it was great and the tunnel seems structurally safe and dry so eventually i might do it up and maybe try and put some kind of lights in there to make going in there a bit easier

5099762 what fear have you faced that has changed your life
5099763 facing a fear often led people to contribute to their communities
5099764 for example two young people who had lost their fathers went on to help others cope with the loss of a parent in general people want a quality of life plus have their basic needs met to be accepted to give and receive love and feel connected
5099765 filmmaking gets stories heard and visible that would otherwise be untold
5099766 sweetland is a great example of a movie about minnesotans im not interested in imported stories
5099767 social documentaries have the power to shape and create a life
5099768 i want to entertain engage a community and confront power
5099769 i can tell you it was a number that disturbed us
5099770 there has been a lot of leaking in this building
5099771 it gets fixed on a reactive mode a very expensive plumbing call
5099772 every single chinese athlete winning a medal will be in adidas on the podium
5099773 the moment for chinese fans is when the gun goes off and when he crosses the finish line if lius in first place the whole nation will go completely insane with excitement and he will be wearing swooshes
5099774 if you want to lead globally you have to lead in china
5099775 we expected the olympics would not be a powerful marketing tool but the opposite has been the case the market hasnt matured to the stage of the us or uk in terms of marketing literacy and the celebrity aspect is still very strong if you can tie liu xiang or yao ming to your product that has a big impact
5099776 other countries are interested in the olympics but in china well over 90 of people are passionate and supportive and want to be involved
5099777 for us its about connecting with athletes we make products that make them perform better and then build on the excitement that creates
5099778 theyre a lot cheaper but the style and technology of adidas and nike are better i usually buy nike for running but a lot of the adidas casualwear looks really good
5099779 china has 400 million under 20s who are watching the olympics and falling in love with sports most people in china still are not playing sport when it does catch up wow
5099780 imagine you had all the students at oxford trying to access the web through a single uk household connection

5099783 the speed that knowledge currently moves in africa is 5mph walking pace but with decent connectivity knowledge will travel at the speed of light
5099784 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5099785 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5099786 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5099787 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5099788 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5099789 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5099790 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5099791 the pill may put you off smell of your man and ruin your relationship
5099792 emmas like a sister to me so its going to be like really really weird
5099793 at first i thought id have pants underwear on for the scene apparently not

5099796 long only funds are far more positive the two year old trade of long commodities and currency and short financials is out this can be seen in the gradual fall of the euro against the dollar
5099797 there is good chance that one side of this big trade could be equities in the last 15 days top end banks have risen 40 50 while commodities are down 30 this is essentially a big trade
5099798 she would be happy yes its a message for all kids that katelynn was loved and will be well missed by everybody in parkdale that knew her
5099799 katelynn fell through the cracks and i blame especially the courts for what happened to her
5099800 in 2009 shinjukus drug trade just got a whole lot bloodier a new narcotic endows users with demon like horns fangs and a raging appetite for human flesh when a man named eiji kuraza transforms into a murderous demon and then goes missing his girlfriend shizuka will stop at nothing to find him following a trail of violence narcotics and prostitution shizuka hires supernatural p i tsunami for his expertise while she joins the red light district to conduct her own investigation
5099801 because of my long thoughtful intriguing posts about the creative process
5099802 while the chorus of party political agreement will be passed off as a reflection of common sense it is in reality an unthinking media driven consensus that is doomed to fail
5099803 is all of this a solution in search of a problem
5099804 there is a worrying rise in violent crime orchestrated by what are loosely called criminal gangs
5099805 more of the same laws do not however constitute an effective solution
5099806 dont lead by isolating the root causes of crime applying radical solutions instead of pandering to the second hand fears of those who admit to having no direct experience of crime
5099807 area of criminal injuries compensation victim advocacy in trial processes and the less glamorous area of restorative justice
5099808 be worth it after being spat out after 5 years and decimated as a party
5099809 only here is there a conservative party and tory press largely in the hands of people whose basic commitment is to the national interest of another country or countries
5099810 at least brown knows that slogans are never a substitute for policies
5099811 what have you done for us besides the low tax economy
5099812 the candidate the process the message have to be planned out and the game plan executed with total discipline
5099813 allows the broader labour movement to influence the direction of government policy to the extent that they could ameliorate the worst effects of what the other side was contemplating
5099814 a comparison with the workers party is instructive here its democratic centralist leninist discipline broke down under the impact of electoral success and having to operate as a normal parliamentary party
5099815 fianna f il wants to be the cherry picker party permanently in full term government with an ever changing bowl of cherries
5099816 we have to work harder to get them in the door and satisfy them its about capturing their attention
5099817 its about girls seeing celebrities on tv shows movies and concert tours and now they get to communicate about clothing on social networking sites more communicating tools are available to spread the word about fashion a celebrity is wearing that drives tween fashion
5099818 a lot of the very fashionable looks right now are very modest
5099819 its almost a flashback to looking very demure and proper
5099820 girls are dressing for themselves as opposed to dressing for guys
5099821 the guys might not like it but the girls are not wearing really tight shirts theyre covered up
5099822 and now it appears that people taking antidepressants who also have relatively higher depression scores fare significantly worse when attempting to perform a computerized simulation of driving
5099823 and i wouldnt want to instill fear in drivers but i think that perhaps individuals who are taking these medications should just be aware of the fact that they may cause concentration problems and impair reaction time
5099824 this issue is not just a question for drivers because the cognitive skills needed for driving are also needed for a lot of other skills
5099825 there is already a very deep literature about subtle impairments of higher cognitive function associated with clinical depression itself apart from medications
5099826 i would add that in any case medication package inserts routinely warn patients about a whole host of issues when starting a course of psychotropic drugs including warning against the handling of machinery driving or engaging in any occupation in which you can be injured so to that extent this concern isnt new
5099827 often resolving these issues can result in enhanced stability and performance

5099840 thanks to the information shared by doe runs matthew pratt teachers participating in the four week long program and their current and future students will have a much better understanding of the importance of lead in todays society
5099841 of special interest to the teachers was how lead particularly from spent automotive batteries is recycled and can be used over and over and over again its a success story that most of the public has not heard
5099842 lead tends to get a bad rap but it is a metal that is vital to our everyday lives
5099843 without it our cars wouldnt start medical services would be impacted communications would suffer the world would change dramatically as producers we must do our utmost to protect safety health and the environment using the best technology available while providing this vital metal to consumers

5099851 we were investigating pathaks family who lived in the company quarters at thane but after the complaint was lodged his family also shifted to mathura

5099853 khans father who runs a medical store in the slums of juhu was called for inquiry to ascertain the whereabouts of his son who is presently absconding
5099854 all those who have links with simi and are remotely linked with mumbai or maharashtra have always been our suspects the list of suspects is much more and it does not only involve khan we have given a list of 25 suspected simi members to gujarat police and would now give the list of people who were actively involved as simi members in mp to the police of that state
5099855 since khan was in indore it is very much possible that he had booked the vehicles which were stolen from navi mumbai and smuggled to vapi later in bharuch their number plates were changed and they were laden with explosives
5099856 according to our information tauqeer was involved in the 2006 mumbai serial train blasts but his role is still not clear tauqeer is a full time simi activist and has been supporting the hardline ideology of the banned outfit
5099857 we cannot comment about it at this stage since mumbai police are investigating it
5099858 both mufti abu bashar and tauqeer were working under him we may get some important clues about simi operations if we take nagouri in custody
5099859 tauqeer was wanted in an unlawful and disruptive activities act uapa in mumbai in year 2006 his name was not there in the chargesheet i dont know if gujarat police have different information about his role in the mumbai blasts

5099863 underlined the need for the unconditional and strict fulfilment by the georgian side of the return of its military units to their permanent positions
5099864 serious consequences that a failure to quickly and fully implement the deal would have on relations between russia and the european union
5099865 this is the promise that the russian president has given to the french president i hope this time hell keep his word

5099900 the chief minister at a meeting with the central leadership indicated that performance of the democratic front government will become crucial in the election year moreover it is time the government gets rid of ministers in the cabinet who have constantly worked against the congress in their respective regions
