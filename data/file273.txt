2730000 if the police used peace bats instead of billy clubs no one would get hurt and the laughter and merriment that would ensue would be sure to cripple any thoughts of real violence on both sides the group says in a statement
2730001 most activists want peaceful nonviolent protests where nobody gets hurt
2730002 once again the rich orgy of affluence tries to give us another snow job its the same regurgitated circus that we get every four years a liberal fa ade called yippie presents america up for grabs no matter what we still have to take on the bad clowns and the bad circus being perpetrated by corporate cartel are we obamanable or will we suffer under four years of elmer fudd mccain

2730007 by christmas the whole area will be a great decorative and vivacious place to walk and shop around i think this is the right time and right place for this development
2730008 passing trade has drastically gone because of the omalley and street developments
2730009 we are very isolated here while all this is going on and its a big effort for people to come over to us
2730010 people are creatures of habit and if they go to another salon on a different street its hard to get them back but the street will look great when its done
2730011 we didnt lose a whole lot of business because we do not really have a passing trade people come to us on a mission
2730012 we expected to lose a bit of trade but we were willing to take the hit because the street will be great when its complete
2730013 it is a bit of a mess but the end result will be worth it overall i am very pleased and looking forward to the finished product

2730019 and the rest will pay as the land given to these developers could have been used to develop a public maternity unit or other facility of benefit to the community
2730020 michael cullen chief executive of the beacon medical has said health insurance premiums would have to rise by at least 15 20 per cent i believe premiums could rise by multiples of that
2730021 it strikes down risk equalisation and thus attacks the system of community rating which prevents health insurance companies from exploiting older people and others more likely to fall ill
2730022 one of the biggest flaws in the co location plan has been that older people will not be able to afford to continue to pay for it in their retirement these people will not be able to afford to access these new proposed co located hospitals meanwhile half of our population is already paying on the double for healthcare through paye prsi and expensive personal health insurance
2730023 divisive co location plan will consolidate health apartheid long after she leaves the political arena
2730024 how much tax would be foregone under this scheme are we correct in estimating that it will be 800m euro how much income will public hospitals lose from insurers are we correct in estimating that it will be 560m euro
2730025 will public hospitals be allocated monies to treat the extra public patients in vacated beds
2730026 minister harney stridently maintains that co location will be positive for public and private patients
2730027 will she tell us the answers to these questions or must we swallow and pay for a pig in a poke nothing she has said so far changes labours staunch opposition to co location

2730056 ny times huffs at entirely false rumors about obama in small town america media mostly mia on obamas america no longer what it once was downer delivered to 7 year old
2730057 gop campaign launches three ads as obama heads for a week in hawaii
2730058 obama has criticized bush for his fiscal irresponsibility and now hes using bushs baseline as a yardstick by which to measure fiscal responsibility
2730059 congress hasnt agreed to extend the bush tax cuts because they dont have the money to pay for it
2730060 its not unreasonable to say were inheriting a budget thats going to have substantial deficits into the future
2730061 leaving some of the tax cuts in place would cost us a small fortune
2730062 i dont know that any blue dog has a good way to pay for that
2730063 ein riesenerfolg das war wichtig dass der kopf frei wird
2730064 ich hoffe dass damit der bann gebrochen ist es gab schon einige erwartungen die sich nicht erf llt haben aber hnlich war es ja schon beim auftakt 2004 in athen
2730065 sie hat gleich gesagt jetzt suche ich meine neue chance am donnerstag im dreistellungskampf diese einstellung w nsche ich mir bei allen
2730066 bisher wurden bereits 130 krokodil kadaver entdeckt und jede woche scheinen mehr entdeckt zu werden
2730067 wir haben alles getestet und uns alles angeschaut was m glicherweise einen einfluss gehabt haben k nnte aber alle tests waren ergebnislos
2730068 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2730069 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2730070 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2730071 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2730072 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2730073 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2730074 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2730075 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2730076 i am pleased to report solid operating results for the quarter despite the difficult industry environment created by unrelentingly high fuel prices

2730078 i am innocent i have been framed by senior sai bosses who did not want me to go to beijing i have cleared at least 30 dope tests before how come just hours before i was scheduled to leave for beijing news is flashed on tv that i have tested positive
2730079 they sai officials are all thieves just because i got into the cleaning act and decided to do away with corrupt sai coaches they are now after monika sais executive director teams rk naidu and sai coach hansa sharma among others have all ganged up against monika and implicated her
2730080 shailaja her coach the andhra association secretary and sai officials naidu and project officer for lifting satish rana have all ganged up against me i want sai to conduct a fresh test im sure ill come out clean i will not go for the b sample test as it will simply be re testing the tampered sample on july 28 when they came to collect my urine sample in bangalore i told them the sample collection bottle was not sealed still they asked me to give the sample
2730081 fly me to beijing and my dope test scheduled for tomorrow will come out negative
2730082 no lifter will ever take the salt when he or she knows it could be detected even after six months the substance monika is being accused of taking can remain in the body for two years
2730083 every athlete caught for dope plays the blame game there is a procedure for appeal and i would suggest monika follows that
2730084 he is not involved with dope testing in any way
2730085 we are not authorised to give the report to players well only forward it to the iwf

2730111 but it looks like the invasion may have already begun
2730112 but a million years later the ice age returned in the far north and put an end to all of that
2730113 the arctic ocean covered densely with ice again became virtually a desert
2730114 theres a fair likelihood the invasion might generate new fisheries
2730115 extinctions are unlikely and there might be a cascading increase in abundance perhaps but thats not easy to predict
2730116 now the future of the housing industry is looking gloomy
2730117 he unsealed his eyes on his possess and looked at rhonda she titled his name and he unsealed his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont yield me im inactivity for you to become back he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his embody was tired

2730125 when they got mated they were kids he was 20 and she was 19 they both grew up together and they both developed in this marriage
2730126 what she module riches the most is the fact that she was his spouse for 30 eld and not exclusive was she his wife but she was his prizewinning friend shes feat to woman him dearly
2730127 i guess the real reason that my wife and i had children is the same reason that napoleon had for invading russia it seemed like a good idea at the time
2730128 our discoveries in afghanistan confirmed our worst fears we have found diagrams of american nuclear power plants
2730129 the wind industry is doing fine the solar industry is doing fine

2730139 you know it just goes to show that god is universal and god is love and
2730140 i knew what i was told about the war was totally false
2730141 in 1968 i came back and dan was across the hall at rand
2730142 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore
2730143 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me
2730144 it was quite a composed row and we know that the germans are unbeaten in the olympic games in the womens quad so we knew how they would be
2730145 at this point i think it is reasonable to say that tomorrow probably will come and go without that happening
2730146 we need to have a strong verification regime before we can take action on removing the north koreans from the state sponsors of terrorism list
2730147 i knew what i was told about the war was totally false
2730148 in 1968 i came back and dan was across the hall at rand
2730149 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore
2730150 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me
2730151 i am going back to being an old school politician and you can read what i think in the newspapers
2730152 there was a time not so long ago when i used to enjoy rushing to this blog and reading comments i used to look forward to pitting my wits against people who i didnt necessarily agree with but who could argue a point on its merit sure they didnt like me and would not trust me further than they could throw me but they had the maturity and self confidence to listen
2730153 last night as i finished my last post i realised that i was filled with dread at the heap of personal abuse i was expecting when i logged on this morning and i was not wrong
2730154 so after almost 42 posts from me and more than 900 comments from all of you i am signing off and i will not be coming back
2730155 its just so exciting i still fell like the normal old nicole that i was before the start of the race
2730156 i just came over the line and there was so much in me so many emotions that all came out at once i was not composed enough to take my hands off the handlebars so much came out of me because thats just the person i am
2730157 before the race we had a plan but the plan went back more than 12 months in terms of what we wanted to do today sharon emma and i all knew we were good riders but we knew our best chance to be successful was to ride as a team to ride to our strengths
2730158 i think it was a very important part of the race
2730159 i think as a team we rode a fantastic race and i couldnt wait to give sharon and emma a big hug because they shared in this medal as well
2730160 wire fencing is everywhere cordoning off huge areas as journalists walking appears to be out of the question as we are expected to take the official buses to every venue
2730161 its hit me pretty hard but lots of people have sent messages and come to see me here in beijing and thats very comforting i had a long chat with di parry yesterday she is very fragile still but she and the children have been overwhelmed and cheered by the response to the news and the warmth and depth of the feelings expressed
2730162 is not to maximise his talent but to make sure that i dont reduce his potential
2730163 i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me
2730164 when he ascended on high he led captives in his train and gave gifts to men
2730165 but we have stood with one another through them all although john believes he should stand alone and take the consequences of his action now when the door closes behind him he has his family waiting for him
2730166 john made a terrible mistake in 2006 the fact that it is a mistake that many others have made before him did not make it any easier for me to hear when he told me what he had done but he did tell me and we began a long and painful process in 2006 a process oddly made somewhat easier with my diagnosis in march 2007
2730167 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2730168 admitting ones mistakes is a hard thing for anyone to do and i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame the toll on our family of news helicopters over our house and reporters in our driveway is yet unknown but now the truth is out and the repair work that began in 2006 will continue
2730169 i ask that the public who expressed concern about the harm
2730170 in certain areas of north cotabato with a specific group of milf all peaceful means have been exhausted to resolve the conflicts and we are now compelled to resort to the application of justifiable force
2730171 iraqis are combating terrorism with one hand and building a democratic state with the other and this is not an easy job
2730172 we have carried messages to all the countries we visited that iraq is in need of reconstruction in all fields including railways oil electricity bridges and housing
2730173 a large trend is being crystallized among the palestinian national authority pna in ramallah to call for settling the situation with the gaza strip by force
2730174 to give the last chance for the egyptian government and the arab league to convince hamas to immediately end its coup and engage in the dialogue
2730175 but the door for dialogue will not be open forever and the leadership only gave one month time for the efforts
2730176 will be a dangerous thing if it was officially made
2730177 it will boost the internal split and separate gaza from the west bank
2730178 fatah elements who dominate the plos executive committee have a plan to prevent any attempt of approach between hamas and fatah
2730179 a call to action saving lives through nuclear weapons control and disarmament
2730180 it felt like someone had opened the door of a furnace behind you
2730181 weve got to get rid of these nuclear weapons before something terrible happens
2730182 both sides of the camp are talking about the need to reduce nuclear weapons
2730183 ik had zo graag voor brons willen kampen want het was echt haalbaar maar voor de tweede sessie heb ik een tweede inspuiting voor mijn schouder gevraagd en dat is verkeerd uitgedraaid ik had geen pijn maar ik heb de inspuiting gevraagd omdat het risico op een plotse pijn tijdens de kamp te vermijden
2730184 maar in de opwarming voelde ik dat er iets mis was en het zat direct in mijn hoofd dat ik de kamp niet kon winnen ik was er helemaal niet bij tijdens de kamp nu is het precies of mijn arm verlamd is of 100 kg weegt normaal is zon tweede inspuiting geen probleem maar ik heb er blijkbaar niet goed op gereageerd tegen kaliyeva had ik in normale omstandigheden zeker moeten winnen en daarna ging het om het brons ik zeg niet dat ik tegen haddad zeker zou gewonnen hebben voor het brons maar dan had ik toch de kans gekregen
2730185 ik heb ondertussen ook nog eens de beelden bekeken van de beweging waarmee nakamura mij uitschakelde in de kwartfinales haar aanval is heel mooi maar je ziet dat ik daarna op mijn knie val en dus is het eigenlijk geen score

2730259 a lot of people are very tired after living through the first sodomy trial which had a chilling effect on the country even until today people thought it was blatant political manoeuvering
2730260 the new sodomy charges against anwar ibrahim are all a political game because he is now a real threat to the prime minister
2730261 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly
2730262 it looks like the government is out to fix him again everyone knows that the charge against him is nothing but a lie
2730263 the only thing we can do now is to vote for anwar and make sure he gets to parliament and eventually form the government only then can we right all that is wrong in this country
2730264 residual income can be one of the most lucrative means for building wealth youll ever find what is it residual income is defined as an income that you continuously or repeatedly get for a one time effort welcome to wealth creation news well answer all your questions about residual income long term residual income streams or quick hit fast money this has been the question that all successful network marketers eventually must ask themselves unfortunately you cant have them both making the wrong decision on this question may provide you with an influx of temporary cash but you will never find a home you will never be able to build a residual income stream that can be passed down to future generations
2730265 perhaps the best product is one that has recurring monthly fees this is known as residual income and is the best income to make because you make one sale but are paid month after month would you rather make one sale for a one time 65 or one sale for a monthly subscription at 10 per month i would rather have the monthly subscription because after the seventh month i will have made more than the 65 from the first sale and the money will keep coming it is possible that you can still be making money three years down the road from one sale
2730266 what if something previously unimaginable suddenly became a reality an opportunity so incredible that the most successful people in the nation would be amazed a final frontier that could quickly become the fastest opportunity witnessed in u s history what if well the unimaginable has become reality and the way you think about wireless phones is about to change forever our new and innovative wireless business is creating an unparalleled home business opportunity for people everywhere the largest transfer of wealth is about to get underway as people in the u s replace the last of their land line carriers and go 100 wireless

2730273 today the 1988 gretzky deal is credited for paving the way to the nhls expansion into non traditional markets and creating an entire generation of players from those areas you see california kids all of the time on junior rosters and there are many california kids and 95 of them are there because of gretzkys presence in california said atlanta thrashers general manager don waddell usa hockey executive director dave ogrean said gretzky captured the imagination of a lot of young people who wanted to be him in 2006 the nashville predators made john blum the first californian selected in the first round of the nhl draft as a singular event you can argue that wayne going to los angeles was as much a catalyst for participation growth in this country as anything in the last 30 years except the miracle on ice in 1980 ogrean said
2730274 in the days before internet saturation and wall to wall espn crawls news traveled a little slower than it does today so it took awhile before martin gelinas actually believed he was a part of the most significant trade in nhl history 20 years ago saturday it was one thing when friends came up to him at the little rink in shawinigan quebec where gelinas was skating that august day and told him he was being dealt from los angeles to edmonton but when he got the call from then oilers general manager glen sather making it official the forward knew hed been involved in something very very big i was shocked because back then trades like that just didnt happen said gelinas who played for the predators last season the media and the circus around that trade were incredible so there was a lot of attention and any time your name is included in a trade for gretzky youre going to remember it two decades later the magnitude of the deal has not been reduced
2730275 while veteran leadership and experience are crucial in a short tournament like the world junior championship there also is room for fresh faces for that reason it should not be a shock that all seven entry draft eligible players invited to the 2008 united states national junior evaluation camp remain here as the week long camp enters it home stretch other older players have been sent home for various reasons but all of the youngsters are still going strong so why are the americans going with such a youth movement the answer is two fold it appears ron rolston who will coach the world junior championship team this december in ottawa says it is about scouting future stars
2730276 the good thing is in years past most guys didnt come back to north carolina because they didnt feel theyd get the level of practice to mimic what you would get in another nhl city now you have that the difficulty we have is trying to find ice there are so many camps and hockey has grown so much you end up skating at 6 15 a m

2730436 i was at the beverly hills hotel and i was lying on my sun lounger outside at night looking up then about 300 foot above me there was this square thing which just passed over my head silently and then shot off the next one was the weirdest one yet id just written a song called arizona and its all about alien contact and i was playing that i stood on the balcony and there was this big ball of gold light that turned up we thought it was venus or mars or something then the song stops playing and it disappears but then we put arizona on again and the ball turned back up it happened four times after that a massive electrical storm started and these two big massive balls of light started dancing in the sky it was like a whole light show for about an hour

2730451 erramos muito isso nosso contra ataque tem que melhorar n o podemos nos dar ao luxo de ir mal assim daqui pra frente
2730452 mas passou o nervosismo estrear contra um advers rio teoricamente inferior te deixa mais tranq ilo s que agora ser diferente
2730453 hoje nosso contra ataque n o funcionou os fundamentos precisam ser melhores
2730454 entramos com seriedade vontade de ganhar jogamos como se fosse final de campeonato
2730455 a s rvia jogou conosco quatro vezes na liga mundial e em todas elas foi 3 a 2 ganhamos tr s e perdemos uma temos que ter muita cautela porque eles t m muito volume de jogo

2730457 as of today most of the city tskhinvali is controlled by russian peacekeeping forces
2730458 military commanders have made their decision to pull back from tskhinvali this morning
2730459 we deplore the dangerous and disproportionate actions by russian forces and we would be particularly troubled if these attacks are continuing now as the georgians are pulling back
2730460 it is my dearest hope that military action will stop immediately and that they will abstain in the name of their common christian inheritance from further clashes and violence
2730461 the georgian tanks fired at everything they saw including women and children
2730462 its so difficult to be here and know my husband is still in south ossetia every moment i fear the worst will happen she said
2730463 no pensamos este proyecto para medir la inseguridad sino m s bien pretende ser un ndice de la falta de educaci n
2730464 algunos comparan esta idea con el bic mac index ndice de medici n de poder adquisitivo elaborado por el semanario brit nico the economist indic pasik pero nosotros queremos mostrar algo m s profundo la p rdida de la calidad de vida en nuestra ciudad
2730465 pero tambi n mide la paranoia que generan los medios demostrando que algunos lugares no son tan inseguros como se dice
2730466 creo que mi generaci n es la ltima que vivi una infancia en la que se pod a jugar tranquilo en la calle o tomar mate en la vereda de cualquier barrio porte o opin pasik en cambio mi hija no conoce las plazas sin rejas
2730467 pero tuvimos tanta repercusi n que aunque quer amos ser publicados en la secci n cultural de los medios terminamos siendo presentados en los policiales
2730468 no es la intenci n del proyecto y de todos modos creo que quedan bastante escrachados en internet
2730469 m s all del tema de la inseguridad nuestro objetivo es mostrar lo f cil que es difundir una creaci n propia indic pasik s lo hace falta una c mara hogare a y una idea original
2730470 seg n un relevamiento que hicimos con las escuelas publicas secundarias de la provincia cuyo objetivo era saber qu cantidad de chicos no terminan sus estudios secundarios luego de haberlos cursados nos encontramos con que 10 000 chicos aproximadamente han cursado la escuela secundaria pero no tienen su t tulo que los habilitar a a seguir sus estudios eso significa que en 5 cortes es decir en los ltimos 5 a os aproximadamente 2 000 chicos por a o cursaron el tercer a o del polimodal recibieron un diploma de cursado realizaron su baile de egresado hicieron su fiesta tradicional viajaron a bariloche y tambi n realizaron un esfuerzo de 12 a os en la escuela pero en definitiva no recibieron su titulo secundario ya sea porque adeudan una o dos materias y lamentablemente pasan a integrar a ese rubro de alumnos de secundaria incompleta
2730471 este dato continuo nos da pie a repensar y mirar en primer lugar a cada escuela en su interior para comprender cu l es el problema en que estamos fallando nosotros como instituci n y en segundo lugar hacernos recapacitar como sociedad en su conjunto porque somos sabedores que la educaci n es un bien social es un derecho tambi n es una obligaci n del estado pero tambi n creemos que la familia y la sociedad en un todo tiene suma importancia y es ah en donde debemos comprometernos para solucionar esa problem tica
2730472 esto lo vamos a solucionar con un programa nacional llamado fines que ya est funcionando en las escuela a partir de este a o que son para chicos de entre 18 y 25 a os que adeudan materias los cuales pueden rendir las mismas a trav s de mesas examinadoras
2730473 es ca tica debido a la negativa de la secretar a de transporte de autorizar un incremento del 30 por ciento en los valores de los pasajes
2730474 no se pudieron pagar los sueldos de julio y s lo pudimos comprar el 50 del combustible que normalmente se compra de seguir as vamos a estar imposibilitados de seguir cumpliendo con las actividades
2730475 las empresas lamentablemente se vieron en la obligaci n de suspender gran cantidad de servicios
2730476 enviar a la gente a que est 10 12 horas parada en los piquetes es agravar aun m s la situaci n
2730477 las empresas se est n quedando sin caja para afrontar el pago de los salarios
2730478 update went back last night seduced by the lure of sandwiches
2730479 yeah im cool yet sophisticated but not in a complete business suit way
2730480 im from the east village and work an indie environment and probably live and breath the shins and decemberists so im better than you unculture gramercy parkers
2730481 to know what shes doing because i dont feel like being the teacher again
2730482 it is clear to many that the major parties have failed to meet the challenges of our time a growing new trend away from nonperforming and unaccountable parties is increasingly visible and in my opinion much needed i feel that i can best continue to serve unencumbered by the labels
2730483 in bethlehem to see the manger where he was born
2730484 they really love barack obama in germany hes like a rock star over there impressive until you realise that david hasselhoff is also like a rock star over there
2730485 we had a hard time convincing people that obama is funny for a long time our audiences seemed unsure whether to laugh at him the first black president is not a gag but thats changing because hes doing more stuff thats easy to mock and people are more familiar with him
2730486 barack obama has long been his partys presumptive nominee now hes becoming its presumptuous nominee
2730487 barack obama now says hes open to offshore oil drilling so apparently when he promised change he was talking about his mind
2730488 he did this speech and 100 000 people showed up there were so many germans shouting and screaming that france surrendered just in case
2730489 they really love barack obama in germany hes like a rock star over there impressive until you realize that david hasselhoff is also like a rock star over there
2730490 of course obamas supporters got him his usual birthday gifts of gold frankincense and myrrh
2730491 obamas people are trying to portray mccain as cranky and mccain is trying to portray obama as arrogant you see
2730492 see barack obama on the news hes becoming a workout fanatic hes at the gym like twice a day sometimes three times a day at the gym yeah according to his staff well he has to stay in shape to do those flip flops
2730493 if inflation fears are curbed by energy and commodities pulling back that provides more flexibility for central banks which have been caught between a rock and a hard place until now especially in europe
2730494 as if the government lowered the tax rate on businesses and individuals
2730495 helps the economy at the margin but it hardly makes the debt implosion better
2730496 we need to keep the drop in oil prices in perspective gasoline prices at the pump are still up over 30 compared with last year
2730497 struggling at the moment to keep within the range of the weather conditions that they have committed for the quality for the athletes
2730498 a little bit of wind a little bit of rain can change the numbers significantly
2730499 and i hope that bit of luck will also be part of the next few days
2730500 at the moment the international olympic committee the beijing organizing committee and the whole olympic movement are clearly watching the numbers
2730501 as you know there has been a lot of talk about who world health organization guidelines and about national standards at the moment the pollution levels have been increasing over the last few days but likely to stabilize
2730502 at this moment in time the ioc is in charge of determining at what point an event might have to postponed or shifted
2730503 that circumstance has not yet arisen according to the data
2730504 for all intents and purposes the data that is available to me right now indicates that according to national standards and who guidelines in terms of the intermediate steps for a developing nation its currently being met by the conditions that are in place for athletes here
2730505 i think any athlete should not be blamed for being concerned about this issue
2730506 you know you come here you want to win the gold medal this is the one day perhaps when you are going to perform better than ever obviously you want ideal conditions
2730507 but the truth is across the world environment is becoming a challenge for us as human beings and i only need to remind you that air pollution is not an issue unique to beijing
2730508 we gt must dispel the myth that renewables are cheap because we have been silent gt on this people think it wont cost anything
2730509 we gt gt must dispel the myth that renewables are cheap because we have been gt gt silent on this people think it wont cost anything
2730510 ensure that there is a calculation and analysis of the need to provide flexible fossil fuelled back up capacity for the increased level of intermittent renewable e g marine and wind generation estimates suggest that this back up capability could amount to over 90 per cent of this intermittent capacity itself overall then that could require an increase in the uks installed generating capacity from todays 76gw to more than 120gw by 2020
2730511 ukraine reserves the right to bar warships and vessels which could take part in the action conflict with georgia from returning to ukrainian territory until the conflict is solved
2730512 o n mero de den ncias feitas por dirigentes de unidades escolares muito baixo infelizmente eu percebo que os profissionais de educa o s o mais omissos em rela o aos problemas ocorridos com a crian a e adolescente v tima
2730513 we are planning to make this our biggest book drive ever
2730514 more of our stores are participating this year and they are doing some truly creative things to get our customers motivated to help a record number of charities and as a result a record number of kids our customers are extremely generous and we thank them for their enthusiastic support of this community based effort with the start of the new school year this is a great time to purchase new books to promote reading to children of all ages
2730515 general anatoly khrulyov was travelling in a military convoy when it came under fire from the georgians the commander has shrapnel wounds
2730516 a lot of non black people will say that the election of barack obama is now proof we dont need affirmative action
2730517 in such a way where some of our children who are advantaged arent getting more favorable treatment than a poor white kid who has struggled more
2730518 i have no way of knowing whether i was a beneficiary of affirmative action either in my admission to harvard or my initial election to the review if i was then i certainly am not ashamed of the fact for i would argue that affirmative action is important precisely because those who benefit typically rise to the challenge when given an opportunity
2730519 dreams from my father a story of race and inheritance
2730520 there is not a black america and a and latino america and asian the united states of america
2730521 an emphasis on universal as opposed to race specific programs isnt just good policy its also good politics
2730522 position on affirmative action programs is important in determining how they will vote
2730523 obama is missing an enormous opportunity because a lot of those who are skeptical of him could close escrow on him if he could give some very visible explanation of his non raciality
2730524 i am disappointed that flipped and changed his position i think in the past he had been opposed to these kinds of ward connerly referenda or initiatives as divisive and i think hes right
2730525 there is precious little evidence that these ballot initiatives drive up turnout in the presidential election
2730526 i dont think he is missing an opportunity on affirmative action
2730527 when the color of ones skin puts one in a position of being treated unequally
2730528 it racializes the campaign in a sense that obama has been trying to avoid
2730529 needs a very large black turnout in several key states and if he takes a position that suppresses the enthusiasm of potential voters who are supporters of affirmative action then hed be in trouble
2730530 could use it if he wanted to have his own
2730531 as our meetup group is growing last month we met in the back room at the kingfish and it worked out well for us
2730532 election day is creeping nearer and disgust and contempt for the two older parties and their antics keeps growing the two big party presidential candidates havent even selected their running mates yet while the libertarian party ticket of bob barr and wayne root has been active on the campaign trail since their nomination at the libertarian party national convention on may 26 2008 if bob barr can attract as little as 2 of the kentucky vote this november then libertarian party candidates in kentucky will have automatic ballot access over the next four years just think no more collecting signatures to get on the ballot
2730533 s de sentar l esta manh e ver michael phelps quebrar o recorde foi algo especial para mim porque me fez perceber quantas pessoas est o inspiradas por ele e que eu agora estou nesta posi o de entrar em quadra e ganhar uma medalha para meu pa s
2730534 definitivamente estava mais nervoso que em um jogo normal j diferente na copa davis porque empolgante excitante mas isso aqui uma loucura
2730535 vai ser cansativo no final das semana seja que for que fique de p ser algu m em grande forma f sica
2730536 family is everything family is more important than the person the patriarch and matriachs word is law embarrass the family and you might as well be outcast from that family those cultures are not exactly tolerant of open homosexuality either so that makes it all the more difficult
2730537 words of wisdom when one is pregnant or breast feeding it is recommended that they check with their physician before starting any type of herbal remedy either to be taken internally or externally the skin is the bodys first line of defense it repels and absorbs all sorts of toxins that are in the air soil and water so whether the herbal mixture is to be taken internally or used externally it will eventually end up in the blood stream so always check with your doctor before using any herbal remedy
2730538 inflammation of the skin sunburn insect bites bruises scratches poison ivy poison oak diaper rash exzema bedsores and itching
2730539 we weight the average based on the reliability of the pollster
2730540 the polls that have a better track record are obviously going to be emphasized more heavily we look at sample size we look at how recent the poll was we also skew various demographic factors as well
2730541 the simulation takes the polls we have now and recognizes that this far out from the election there are a lot of uncertainties
2730542 there was a point in time in 1984 at which walter mondale led ronald reagan by 17 points or something so we look at how much polls move over time plus the margin of error in each poll plus the fact that polls are never as good as they claim to be and we just simulate around that
2730543 the medias lack of interest is hardly surprising while voter registration drives are invaluable theyre also dry and tedious not that exciting to participate in or to write about
2730544 this just reinforces the sentiment that a lot of republican strategists are having right now that clinton might actually be the more formidable fall candidate for a lot of reasons not the least of which is that obama cant seem to get his footing back
2730545 is by any definition very liberal to the left of hillary clinton in a center right country that is very very helpful to us
2730546 maybe we should ask barack if hes comfortable and needs another pillow
2730547 maybe we should ask barack if hes comfortable and needs another pillow
2730548 look at this great tool i got at the big box store bob only 39 95 and it will pick up a dime off a sheet of glass
2730549 yep they had a ton of em just a ton cmon ill drive you
2730550 i dok se debatira oko za tite djece od pornografije na intrernetu i o uvanja prava prvog amandmana pornografska industrija nastavlja svoj munjevit rast
2730551 profitiranje mainstream kompanija od seksualno eksplicitnog materijala pomoglo je legitimizaciji pornografije kao normalne i uobi ajene
2730552 suprotno tvrdnjama koje esto ujemo pornografska industrija za odrasle ne bavi se dje jom pornografijom industrija ne zapo ljava djecu niti omogu ava pristup toj vrsti siteova svaki ameri ki pornografski site napravljen je u skladu s ameri kim zakonima pa samim tim te stranice provode i sce federalne zakone vezane uz dje ju pronografiju
2730553 iako postoji velik broju softvera za filtriranje djeca pristupaju sve ve oj koli ini pornografskog materijala prekovlastiti ili obiteljskih ra unala sa sve ve im brojem mobilnih ure aja internet mo e donijeti takve materijale u kole ili mjesta na kojima se djeca okupljaju a gdje roditelji ne mogu provoditi kontrolu
2730554 from here on in bill is going to be our man in antarctica
2730555 we have sent him down there with enough food and firewood to last until the democratic convention this summer
2730556 this race isnt about votes or delegates its about land mass frozen tundra and penguins
2730557 i have devoted the last 30 plus years to doing whatever i could to help in reducing poverty in america i believe the recently enacted welfare bill goes in the opposite direction
2730558 do you still think barack obama lacks experience to be commander in chief
2730559 that he doesnt understand the problems of the white working class
2730560 do you still think his past association with reverend wright is very troublesome
2730561 during the primary campaign your vp said your healthcare plan sucked was she right does it suck
2730562 do you want to obliterate iran too like your vice president
2730563 two people who loved this country and were devoted to the interest of this country
2730564 in electoral votes clinton beats mccain and is way ahead of obama obama likely to lose electoral vote to mccain
2730565 this is my definition of a living and breathing nightmare one with plenty of 3 a m calls from bill even worse than sharing a campaign with bill and hill allying with the clintons would undermine the very essence of the obama message that real change is needed in washington it would be seen as completely inauthentic the worst type of marriage of convenience and unlike the shotgun marriage jfk made with lbj hillary brings nothing to the table unlike lbj she cant bring a swing state into the democratic column obama could win new york with daffy duck as his vp
2730566 our young voters are not racist like the older ones but they tend not to turn out the numbers favor the older voters the older voters turn out a lot of the time they have nothing else to do but play shuffleboard anyway
2730567 we dont believe that the three were released by coincidence
2730568 apparently they were released to pave the way for agreement on a prisoner exchange
2730569 hamas is lying when it says that its not conducting negotiations with israel
2730570 they are talking to israel through the egyptians and other arab parties
2730571 undoubtedly the release of the hamas prisoners will create a better atmosphere for negotiations to reach a prisoner exchange
2730572 but i cant tell you if this move is linked to the ongoing egyptian efforts to reach a prisoner swap agreement
2730573 when hamas signs an agreement it abides by it but the israelis want to deal with us the same way they have been dealing with mahmoud abbass authority they want the palestinians to honor all the agreements while they themselves dont abide by them

2730577 i am very excited about this promotion and the opportunity to help those in need
2730578 we very much appreciate the overwhelming response from our vendors desire to get involved as well we are hoping to make a significant contribution and we appreciate our key partners which are helping to make this happen
2730579 it is the chance to make a change in the world and help those in need that inspires us to make this fund raiser as successful as possible
2730580 georgia could have used the years of saakashvilis presidency in different ways to build up the economy to develop the infrastructure to solve social issues both in south ossetia abkhazia and the whole state instead the georgian leadership with president saakashvili undertook consistent steps to increase its military budget from us 30 million to us 1 billion georgia was preparing for a military action
2730581 the lord loves you thats my message to you hes anxious for you to praise your heavenly father as you pray to our heavenly father youll feel strength come into your souls and youll know within your heart an event of this nature is approved by the lord so let us rejoice tonight
2730582 i think its a great opportunity for many of these youth to participate in this event being as its the first time theyve seen the prophet and also a new era for the church here in panama
2730583 i feel very good because its the first time that a president has come to panama to see i and all of my sisters dance to him
2730584 the road map to peace only moves in one direction and that direction is from the west bank to the mediterranean sea the only thing in the way is israel
2730585 the al qaeda jihad in the arab peninsula yemens soldiers brigade has carried out this holy operation throwing a grenade to a police patrol under a bridge linking mukalla to al sharj of hadramout in solidarity with our brothers who are in custody of autocrats
2730586 most decision makers have gone on holidays so its a brilliant time to attack a small country
2730587 fifteen ltte terrorists were killed when the army made a daring advance this morning before first light and without sustaining any damage to our own troops
2730588 when youre crap youre scottish but if youre good youre british
2730589 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2730590 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2730591 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2730592 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2730593 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2730594 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2730595 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2730596 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2730597 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2730598 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2730599 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2730600 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

2730618 siempre que se regresa del campo hay que revisar todo el cuerpo para estar seguro de que no hay garrapatas enganchadas sobre todo en los sitios que se suelen pasar por alto como los pies las ingles o la cabeza

2730622 desde o dia que assumi o comando do time falei que a sele o teria a cara do povo brasileiro um povo criticado questionado mas que resolve as coisas estamos aqui para resolver as coisas aqui cada um tempo responsabilidade maturidade hoje foi a recompensa do trabalho para um grupo que est trancado faz 20 dias no hotel s treinando demonstra a seriedade deles
2730623 passamos aos jogadores informa es sobre o advers rio todos fizeram uma tima partida tudo se torna f cil ou dif cil depende como n s jogamos os jogadores tiveram uma noite feliz tudo aquilo que foi ensaiado no treinamento acabou realizado no jogo n o deixamos o rival jogar estamos muito felizes porque superamos mais uma vez uma s rie de dificuldades
2730624 no matter what kind of changes take place in the cross strait relations our stance of adhering to the one china principle and opposing taiwan independence secessionist activities will never change
2730625 in certain areas of north cotabato with a specific group of milf all peaceful means have been exhausted to resolve the conflicts and we are now compelled to resort to the application of justifiable force
2730626 today we are looking at a very nice external hdd enclosure from rosewill the rosewill enclosure has four connectivity options and offers very good performance

2730629 baxter has a talent to define the game which is important
2730630 he can make the moment that matters that wins you a game whether it be a through pass a goal a dribble what ever it may be
2730631 he has that talent in him that is something you cannot give a player it is just inside them you have to nurture it and bring it out of him so he can perform at the highest level
2730632 it might be a little earlier for him at the moment it is wrong to compare him with wayne rooney wayne was a man physically when he was 16 he was strong and very advanced
2730633 but with jose we may have to wait a little longer for that strength but if he continues the way he is and maintains the right attitude to learning there is no reason why he cannot be in our first team very soon
2730634 pre season has been tough because we have really put the players through it but i have been impressed with their fitness levels attitude and energy
2730635 now the fitness is showing through the performance against psv dutch champions again confirmed that they wanted to slow the game down we wanted it speeded up to premier league levels so it was a good challenge
2730636 such a work out will be of great help when our european matches come around
2730637 the fans may be looking for big money signings but they can also see the quality coming through the youth ranks
2730638 i recall things were said a few years back when manchester united went with youth and the likes of david beckham and paul scholes came through
2730639 united at that time did not seem to need to spend big on lots of players with good youngsters around
2730640 i saw small improvements although we are still a long way from good form
2730641 i would like to see the team focused more on the season that is coming up rather than to these friendly tests
2730642 clearly manchester city had a different match fitness to us as they are close to the start of their domestic campaign
2730643 despite our absences we tried to work around that by putting massimo ambrosini in a more advanced role so he could use his strength in the air
2730644 viudez moved well did some good things and i think he is a lad we can count on for the future
2730645 last season will continue to loom large over us until we win a game people wont forget it until that happens
2730646 i think it is fair to say we looked like a team with seven new signings as a team i think doncaster were more comfortable playing with each other
2730647 with seven debutants you are lucky if everything goes to plan but that is taking nothing away from doncaster
2730648 i am aware that we need to gel pretty quickly
2730649 i would call it a good start after 10 games not after 90 minutes
2730650 he is a born finisher if he gets half a chance
2730651 he was the difference in the end in the 93rd minute
2730652 three points on the first day of the season away from home is the perfect beginning
2730653 steve thompson justified his selection by scoring a goal and im very pleased for him
2730654 it always surprises me when people dont want to be positive and instead write negative stories im a positive person
2730655 we made a poor start last season so we wanted to get a first win under our belts as quickly as possible
2730656 prestigio geovision 350 belongs to low cost gps navigation devices we could say that it is cheapest but its exterior doesnt give that impression

2730673 on conditon that the actors of that drama cool down their emotions and stop escalating the conflict
2730674 it seems the eu would be a less abrasive partner and peace keeping force than for instance nato and a more effective one than the u n
2730675 we are ready to act independently we are ready to enforce order and go further if there is resistance from the georgian side
2730676 we are coordinating our actions with russia our biggest friend
2730677 i have asked russian peacekeepers to reinforce their military presence on the georgian abkhaz border contacts with the current leadership of georgia are impossible
2730678 in my opinion they are already elements of some kind of genocide of the ossetian people
2730679 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
2730680 on conditon that the actors of that drama cool down their emotions and stop escalating the conflict
2730681 it seems the eu would be a less abrasive partner and peace keeping force than for instance nato and a more effective one than the u n

2730686 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
2730687 the number of mutations neodarwinism requires to evolve a species
2730688 a cave in malta contains so many fossils that maltas present size would not keep this awesome quantity alive for just one week in america a death pit exists near hollywood with eagles doves and approximately two hundred and fifty saber tooth tigers and fifty elephants
2730689 incidentally when the spaniards migrated to america there was not one elephant to be found and not one single horse in america and yet horses have been found buried and fossilised by the hundreds and thousands in america
2730690 the geologic column was formed with great rapidity in a matter of months
2730691 so there is an open cast coal mine in germany that has a tree going through the layers of sedimentary deposit i find that very interesting and a valid challenge however name the place in germany somewhere in germany is not good enough it is rather a large place especially after unification once the location is known then i am sure there will be throngs of scientific experts examining this challenge to their current beliefs
2730692 re the global flood yes we all know that the mediterranean was flooded but that is not a global flood a global flood is impossible well not quite if all volcanic and tectonic plate movement were to stop right now i e no more mountain building then errosion given millions of years would eventually deposit all mountains content etc into rivers and ultimately the sea then and only then do you have any chance of a global flood somehow i cannot see tectonic plate activity ever stopping can you
2730693 they all take a very long time and certainly longer than this mythical 6000 years
2730694 another strawman argument says that sediments can be rapidly deposited well maybe so they can but sorry guys that does not mean that all or the majorityt of sediments have been laid down quickly lets take limestone which is basically something akin to coral like organisms dying and slowly building up layers well we can witness this today but we dont see these layers rapidly building up do we yet again a little piece of creationist information proves to be misleading which of course is the sole intent oh by the way if sediments can be rapidly deposited then that must be happening now and we should be observing the very formation of fossils
2730695 i notice you are still denying beneficial mutation even after the effort that arcana has made to point you in the direction of numerous examples of beneficial mutation how can you ignore this
2730696 anyhow all of this is wasting my precious time and i will have to sign off now
2730697 and i have pointed out that we have in fact seen increases in genetic information and have even given an example of a known mechanism for such increases much like your refusal to acknowledge transitional fossils your claim about mutations only losing genetic information is completely factually baseless
2730698 on conditon that the actors of that drama cool down their emotions and stop escalating the conflict
2730699 it seems the eu would be a less abrasive partner and peace keeping force than for instance nato and a more effective one than the u n
2730700 we are ready to act independently we are ready to enforce order and go further if there is resistance from the georgian side
2730701 we are coordinating our actions with russia our biggest friend

2730725 no indication that large numbers of refugees have returned because of a positive reassessment of security conditions
2730726 far more than improved conditions at home it is unbearable conditions in exile that appear to have been the determining factor in most returns
2730727 the current situation in iraq does not yet offer the necessary guarantees for a safe sustainable and dignified return of iraqi refugees

2730766 the apostle paul was a mighty debater and has no equal in handling a matter of controversy watch his method he has already referred to abraham and now he produces david because he knew what david meant to the jews he knew that they looked back to david the great king as the greatest of all their kings and he knew the great promise concerning the messiah that had been made to david and that all the jews knew that also indeed he knew and the jews knew that david was a man after gods own heart david stood with abraham in the estimation of the jews in the first position paul quotes him therefore and he is able to prove that david says this precise thing that he is teaching
2730767 so pauls interpretation of davids psalm is right for this reason that forgiveness is the first step in the process that leads to full roconciliation

2730801 we all have experiences in our lives that change us and we all learn from people like my dad but at the end of the day its only us and were only responsible to make ourselves happy too often in life something happens and we blame other people for us not being happy or satisfied or fulfilled so the point is we all have choices and we make the choice to accept people or situations or to not accept situations if someone lies well you had a choice to trust that person or not i think the way my father raised me well he trusted everybody and that worked for him
2730802 what the hell you gonna do about it sit there and b tch and complain and ruin the next two months of your life because something didnt go right for you or do you say you know f ck it lets learn from it lets accept it understand that it didnt happen and move on

2730812 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2730813 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2730815 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2730816 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2730817 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2730852 i havent played at all the last 10 days its one of the hardest moments in my career im very very disappointed
2730853 i went through so many treatments in the last five or 10 days but with this injury it just takes time
2730854 she was already assured of losing the top spot in the rankings monday to no 2 jelena jankovic
2730855 this victory comes as a reward to everything i have been doing and everything i have already done its for all the people who believed in me and helped me on my return
2730856 he is playing with happiness and he is likely to keep improving in the next matches he is gaining his confidence back
2730857 we are all happy to have believed in his ability to return
2730858 and we are happier with the answer he has been giving us on the field
2730859 the ac milan player added his second goal from the penalty spot after being pulled down by a defender inside the area he struck his low shot firmly into the left corner
2730860 im happy for the victory and for helping brazil advance
2730861 it is fathers day in brazil on sunday and ronaldinho dedicated the victory to his son joao
2730862 its too early in brazil so i havent talked to him yet
2730863 and for the support of this declaration with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence we mutually pledge to each other our lives our fortunes and our sacred honor
2730864 we must hang together or most assuredly we shall all hang separately
2730865 the world is a dangerous place to live not because of the people who are evil but because of the people who dont do anything about it
2730866 it is better that a wise enemy should fear you than that foolish friends should praise
2730867 an appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile hoping it will eat him last
2730868 here in america we are descended in blood and spirit from revolutionists and rebels men and women who dare to dissent from accepted doctrine as their heirs may we never confuse honest dissent with disloyal subversion
2730869 good people do not need laws to tell them to act responsibly while bad people will find a way around the laws
2730870 it is not from benevolence of the butcher the brewer or the baker that we can expect our dinner but from their regard to their own interest
2730871 the greatest glory is not in never falling but in rising up every time we fall
2730872 australia captain nicole hudson said the comeback win showed the character of the team
2730873 this will be a very positive influence on our team
2730874 we said at half time if they can score four goals in the first half we can do the same in the second and we played so well
2730875 we came to the olympics with high hopes and expectations
2730876 i believe we were able to achieve this medal because of the people around us who helped us
2730877 in 2004 south korea defeated china by one point but this one wasnt even close however chinas zhang juan juan who was on the 2004 team refused to acknowledge that was an indication that the south koreans had improved dramatically since then
2730878 the korean team really played up to their normal level
2730879 they are a very good team the gap of one point to the nine points does not really illustrate much the surroundings may be different there may be other factors
2730880 i think our team is going to learn more from the korean team
2730881 i think were a good team well find out just how good on wednesday when we play spain
2730882 we knew we needed to win this game spain is coming up so we have to get better as we go
2730883 posisi mereka aspanji dalam hal ini adalah sebagai pihak pelapor dan mereka berjanji akan kembali memberikan bukti bukti lain kepada kppu terkait tender penunjukan langsung proyek pengadaan kendaraan dinas yang terjadi di pemkab nias
2730884 makanya kppu tetap berpegang kepada uu no 5 1999 yakni tentang pelarangan praktek monopoli dan pelarangan persaingan usaha tidak sehat

2730886 its going to be a great time for us just to be together not having to worry about making dinner for ourselves or cleaning up after anyone or doing house stuff
2730887 i didnt expect to have to go again this fast
2730888 i was thrilled to play at home and i played with strength and energy
2730889 i wanted to go 4 03 i didnt know if i would
2730890 to be honest i didnt really feel that great and then going into the ready room i started getting chills up my body right then and there i was starting to get more and more excited i mean i was pretty emotional after that race and im pretty excited to have that first one under my belt
2730891 i wasnt comfortable after the first 200 after seeing everybody so close together
2730892 thats usually not how it as after the first 200 i think it made my breaststroke a lot stronger and at that point it was all adrenaline
2730893 i knew i had to go out fast in order to be in the race
2730894 if i was like a couple tenths slower on the backstroke i think i wouldve had a better shot i think that backstroke kind of took a lot out of me i did my best and i cant ask for anything else
2730895 i saw him after the race and he nodded and waved the american flag
2730896 its a pretty special feeling i waved and nodded my head back
2730897 i think were really happy with silver because i dont think we were even expecting to get that
2730898 i felt great i felt like i had more energy so im really psyched about my 50
2730899 a lot of people are disappointed that we elected a democratic congress in 2006 to end the war and nothing happened
2730900 but as voters engage they will see this campaign through the presidential race prism and thats something reichert doesnt want i view this race as a toss up
2730901 reicherts big problem isnt himself its president bush this could come down to the wire just like last time
2730902 when it comes to life and death issues politics is not a factor
2730903 he talks kind of moderate even i could vote for him
2730904 but what he actually does is something else he votes far left
2730905 i dont believe in no win wars that are just police actions
2730906 only the highest wise men and the lowest fools are unchangeable
2730907 a fully justified faith worthy that we venture to devote ourselves to it for venture is beautiful and peace of mind demands such ideas which work like magic incantations
2730908 solitude is freedom its an anchor an anchor in the void youre anchored to nothing and thats my definition of freedom
2730909 within yourself is a stillness and a sanctuary to which you can retreat at any time and be yourself
2730910 i was shooting good it was great we won the game
2730911 its a great win we really feel good about that but there is still a long way to go

2730920 the claim was supported by a former military aide to the president who said that the armys leadership wished mr musharraf to be spared the humiliation of impeachment
2730921 the civilian government intensified an attritional seven month long power struggle with the presidency when it announced earlier this week that it is to begin impeachment proceedings against mr musharraf on monday
2730922 the twin arbiters of power in pakistan the army chief of staff gen ashfaq kiyani and america which has provided dollars 12 billion in military aid to the country in the last six years have publicly declared themselves to be neutral on pakistans domestic politics
2730923 a senior official from the ruling government coalition partner the pakistans peoples party ppp said that the army has whispered in musharrafs ear that it is time to leave

2730928 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
2730929 we have to be happy to come back from being three goals down against one of the best teams in the world
2730930 this is a recurring theme with us we take a 3 4 goal lead then ease up before breaking the opponent
2730931 but its quite something we could bring this back for a tie and i think well grow stronger by each game
2730932 i think the main thing was defensively we played pretty well
2730933 we had a couple of lapses where we kind of let them get back into the game but we had four quarters of good defences and thats what its going to take to beat some of these better teams
2730934 thats always been on our minds in terms of a scenario we could face

2730939 mr granthams study of bubbles suggests that it takes them about as long to deflate as it did to inflate he says the standard amp poors 500 stock index could fall more than an additional 20 from its current level
2730940 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
2730941 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

2731052 despite these cutbacks in 2008 spending the smb decision makers were actually more optimistic about their implementation of uc applications in the future
2731053 in our 2008 survey u s smbs expected higher attach rates in 2012 for six out of the eight uc applications compared with our 2007 survey results
2731054 both u s and international smbs are optimistic about their progression to the more advanced phases
2731055 these smb decision makers clearly believe in the potential value of uc applications but many are expecting their ipt and uc apps vendors to help them identify the best opportunities for realizing this potential value
2731056 it marks our transition from a successful start up in the emerging field of cell phone recycling into the undisputed global leader in electronics sustainability
2731057 our goal was to develop a profitable company that was socially and environmentally responsible
2731058 through the dedication of a talented team of people recellular has exceeded all expectations with igcs support and investment we will dramatically expand the company and set the standard for success in electronics sustainability and clean tech operations
2731059 they have revolutionized the electronics sustainability industry by providing a convenient solution for consumers to recycle their used handsets while at the same time extracting enough value from these phones to build a successful business we have investigated many clean tech companies including many in the cell phone recycling arena and we felt that recellular was clearly the worlds most promising cell phone reuse and recycling firm
2731060 we chose to partner with igc because of their deep knowledge of the sector their experience with growth stage companies and the value they can bring through rich networks in the u s europe and asia
2731061 we processed almost 5 000 phones in our first year of business
2731062 today we get an average of 24 000 phones enough to fill seven mail trucks every day five days a week with the support and resources of igc we see the potential to double the number of mail trucks delivering to recellular in the very near future
2731063 government should place few if any restrictions on scientific research and development
2731064 arctic deer live on islands in canadas arctic region they search for food by moving over ice from island to island during the course of a year their habitat is limited to areas warm enough to sustain the plants on which they feed and cold enough at least some of the year for the ice to cover the sea separating the islands allowing the deer to travel over it unfortunately according to reports from local hunters the deer populations are declining since these reports coincide with recent global warming trends that have caused the sea ice to melt we can conclude that the decline in arctic deer populations is the result of deer being unable to follow their age old migration patterns across the frozen sea
2731065 all nations should help support the development of a global university designed to engage students in the process of solving the worlds most persistent social problems
2731066 may my words and my thoughts be acceptable in your sight o lord my sheltering rock and my redeemer

2731080 the cultural survival of more than 13 indigenous nations is directly intertwined with the environmental integrity of the holy san francisco peaks
2731081 todays decision not only places these ways of life in peril but sets the stage for an ecological and we have no choice but to uphold our commitment to protect the holy san francisco peaks
2731082 only effect of the proposed upgrades is on the plaintiffs subjective emotional that is the presence of recycled wastewater on the peaks is offensive to the plaintiffs religious sensibilities the diminishment of spiritual fulfillment serious though it may be is not a substantial burden on the free exercise of religion
2731083 the court places itself in the position of judging the legitimacy of and practices it becomes the arbiter of religion which is not the proper role for the courts the evidence clearly shows that the peaks are important to 13 of the tribes in the southwestern united states and that using sewer water to make snow on them constitutes a significant burden on the tribes ability to practice their religion
2731084 the federal government likely holds thousands of acres of land that tribes hold sacred this case was the last best chance for the tribes to be able to provide some legal protection to those lands in a nation that prides itself on religious liberty it is unconscionable that native american beliefs are not respected under the law or the u s supreme court for review of this matter
2731085 this ruling sets a negative precedent that impacts the future of native american religious practice
2731086 religious exercise invariably and centrally involves a subjective spiritual experience
2731087 the majoritys misunderstanding of the nature of religious beliefs and exercise as merely
2731088 rfra was passed to protect the exercise of all religions including the religions of if indians land based exercise of religion is not protected by rfra in this case i cannot imagine a case in which it will be i am truly sorry that the majority has effectively read american indians out of rfra
2731089 this decision is a painful affirmation of the lack of protection for our religious freedom
2731090 it is a bitter reminder that not all citizens are equal in this country but just as the did not give up when courts delivered blow after blow we will not give up until our rights are fully upheld we the youth will continue to stand up for our cultural survival
2731091 the deeply held religious beliefs of hundreds of thousands of citizens of this country have been trumped by a single for profit private business operating on public lands
2731092 eight of eleven judges decided to completely ignore the issue of what happens if a child were to eat this snow
2731093 the court dismissed the whole health issue on a procedural error thereby refusing to comment on the true health impacts of this fake snow which has been proven to contain harmful pharmaceuticals and personal care productions on our children the court has obviously cast off this responsibility and we will continue to demand accountability for our children and the land
2731094 we obviously disagree with ruling snowmaking with sewage is still plainly a bad idea
2731095 well keep fighting along side our partners this ruling only emboldens our resolve
2731096 how many congressmen does it take to change a light bulb

2731099 today in europe you pay 600 a month for gasoline
2731100 we have an electric car that will cost you 600 a month
2731101 so cheap so trivial that you wont even think of buying a gasoline car
2731102 we are on the verge of losing our superpower status
2731103 we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of 700 billion a year i have been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of if we create a renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
2731104 what laws do we need to enact to foster 1 000 more like you
2731105 the demand for green collar jobs is really exploding especially as the cost of energy continues to climb
2731106 students need to start thinking about developing skills that will give them an edge for these types of careers that did not even exist until recently
2731107 while we are looking at god we do not see ourselves blessed riddance the man who has struggled to purify himself and has had nothing but repeated failures will experience real relief when he stops tinkering with his soul and looks away to the perfect one while he looks at christ the very thing he has so long been trying to do will be getting done within him

2731116 you can listen to recorded music and you cannot listen to live music is something which is not understandable how can the police say that listening to music in a club and having a drink lead to crime this has nothing to do with the live band the attitude of the police should be questioned here
2731117 we take so much time producing tracks but there is no one to listen to it honestly i want to go out of this city if this continues
2731118 it has affected our business to about 60 to 70 per cent even today being saturday my club is completely empty

2731124 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2731125 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2731126 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2731127 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2731128 complete genocide putin also said georgia had effectively lost the right to rule the breakaway province an indication moscow could be preparing to fulfill south ossetians wish to be absorbed into russia

2731131 they understand there is a threat but while it exists its not going to be in their lifetime or maybe even in their childrens he said
2731132 people want to live by the sea and a lot of them will take these risks he said
2731133 unfortunately i am unable to sound the all clear after all we have repeatedly eluded a catastrophe by a mere hairs breadth
2731134 considering the statements from al qaeda and the iju we are convinced it has been decided to mount attacks in germany
2731135 however there is currently no concrete evidence of imminent strikes

2731157 there will be professionals who will discuss topics such as the role of the church in suicide prevention suicide prevention in the school setting cultural considerations in preventing youth suicide and suicide prevention on college campuses
2731158 and its because of the statistics suicide is the second leading cause of death for ages 15 24 in mississippi and thats just startling
2731159 we had to close registration for this year because of the size of the facility
2731160 we know what to do next year thats for sure
2731161 the theme is shatter the silence the secret you shouldnt keep
2731162 you have to tell somebody its not a secret you can keep
2731163 its a school based curriculum that focuses on the prevention of suicide by teaching the youth recognition of signs of suicide and how to be concerned for their friends
2731164 it tells them its certainly ok to tell an adult sometimes young people hold those secrets in
2731165 its not to teach teens to be a suicide prevention counselor but to help them understand what they are looking at when they see a child at risk
2731166 i will never hug my son again but i can and will work alongside you perhaps to save your friend your neighbors child a relative or even your own son or daughter
2731167 im looking forward to meeting him as a fellow suicide survivor

2731176 dass ich so viel fahren konnte war ein gutes training f r mich und in die dunkelheit hineinzufahren war eine interessante erfahrung
2731177 ein bisschen schmunzeln musste ich dann doch als ich irgendwo las ich w rde jetzt in die endurance wm einsteigen und um den titel k mpfen wollen bei aller liebe das will ich sicher nicht motorradfahren ist ein hobby f r mich
2731178 ich habe das zweite rennen aber dann doch besser ausgelassen da war soviel regen und schon in der ersten kurve aquaplaning das muss ja nicht sein
2731179 but under the parameters we were given for the federal law we didnt have a choice
2731180 it was a tough decision for all of us because the state law and the federal law are at odds
2731181 this just goes to show the difficulty of getting a fair trial on this in federal court
2731182 the feds are batting a thousand when it comes to getting convictions in these cases you cannot get a fair hearing
2731183 its just not a fair fight when you cant tell the whole story
2731184 the jury selection process revealed that potential jurors in los angeles had major questions about why the feds would be prosecuting someone like charley when there are several dispensaries operating within walking distance of the courthouse there
2731185 those jurors were dismissed for cause so we were left with citizens who were apparently not concerned about the federal governments actions in this case and who felt compelled to follow the judges instructions
2731186 when you have things like owen beck being prevented from testifying that only escalates the tragedy of this case
2731187 the jury was not allowed to hear the whole truth in the larger context of the state law
2731188 when charles was raided his was one of the only facilities in the whole region
2731189 now patients have to go much longer distances sometimes hundreds of miles to get their medicine not only has this destroyed charlies life it has worsened the lives of hundreds of patients
2731190 the sheriff couldnt get a state search warrant so he calls in the dea and participates in the raid
2731191 in return for serving up charley on a silver platter the sheriff got access to all the evidence including patient records
2731192 the dispensary was a rock in the sheriffs shoe so after a years worth of failed investigation sheriff hedges invited the dea to come up to morro bay and raid the dispensary thats the real story here
2731193 they are certainly subject to litigation if someone wants to file a lawsuit against a local official for cooperating with the federal government but its a difficult legal challenge
2731194 there is no law that prohibits local law enforcement from cooperating with the feds what officials like the sheriff are doing is wrongheaded harmful and unnecessary but it will be difficult to win i think
2731195 one thing would be to get a pronouncement from attorney general jerry brown directing law enforcement on appropriate conduct around these issues were expecting that to happen soon
2731196 absence of direction from the attorney general has made it easier not only for federal law enforcement to come in and undermine the implementation of state law but also to make it easier for local law enforcement to help in that effort
2731197 weve had multiple appellate court rulings declaring the states medical marijuana law is not preempted by federal law that the two can coexist and that local law enforcement should be upholding state law and not federal law
2731198 between these rulings and the pending guidelines from the attorney general there will be less and less wiggle room for local law enforcement to skirt the law
2731199 it is certainly an issue to bring up in sheriffs races
2731200 if there are renegade law enforcement officials trying to skirt state law we can try to make them feel the political heat
2731201 there will be a political battle i think public officials will be sorry they got into i think we will see less and less cooperation between local law enforcement and the feds on this
2731202 if we elect obama and he follows through on his promise to end federal raids on dispensaries then we will hopefully see less federal activity here in california
2731203 we need to see either marijuana rescheduled as something other than schedule 1 or the us supreme courts raich decision needs to be revisited and overruled the logic behind that decision that medical marijuana grown distributed and consumed within california affects interstate commerce is a stretch at best
2731204 what we need is a comprehensive federal policy in the us
2731205 rescheduling or passing hinchey would be easier than passing either decriminalization or legalization but we would welcome any of those well be working for a sweeping federal policy that includes rescheduling further research and allows for safe access to medical marijuana for patients all across the country
2731206 i told him not to go because its during the olympic games and this period is sensitive
2731207 but he was determined to go because he said that church was where he was baptized so i went with him hoping to protect him

2731215 when we first looked into finding a web hosting service provider we were completely stumped the sheer number of web hosting service providers and available plans made it hard even for us to make a decision about which one to choose this site was made with the intent of making the whole process a lot easier for you than it was for us
2731216 part of what makes our sites so successful is the fact that we arent afraid to tell people who dont have a clue what theyre really getting out of the service
2731217 no this provider doesnt have a money back guarantee but they will refund any time for unused months of service details like that
2731218 we want people who visit the site to have an enlightening experience whether they know something about web hosting or not
2731219 we try to help people be able to make an informed decision about the web hosting service they choose
2731220 the conflict has caused civilian casualties and more are at risk
2731221 it is essential that humanitarian agencies be able to reach the affected and the displaced and that those trapped in conflict areas be granted passage to safer areas as soon as possible
2731222 it is absolutely essential that both sides respect humanitarian principles and ensure the protection and safety of civilians
2731223 the georgians have said that 2 400 people have fled into georgia proper but our representative there believes this figure is substantially higher
2731224 we communicated that message beforehand to the russians through u
2731225 we must check all that we dont trust the georgian side
2731226 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2731227 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2731228 the deployment is quite natural we dont want a repeat of what happened in south ossetia
2731229 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2731230 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2731231 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations

2731236 there is nobody on the trip he could possibly hook up with and definitely not the woman in the photos or any of the women there
2731237 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2731238 the talks are still ongoing theres been a great deal of progress the deal is very close it is about to be closed
2731239 our negotiators have really found compromises on all these issues
2731240 you may hear many dates but i caution you not to take any of these dates until you get the final document
2731241 during the last four days more than 100 militants have been killed and nine security personnel have also died
2731242 the troops casualties may rise as some of their soldiers were missing
2731243 at this point i think it is reasonable to say that tomorrow probably will come and go without that happening
2731244 we need to have a strong verification regime before we can take action on removing the north koreans from the state sponsors of terrorism list

2731246 one restaurant company is interested in building a mixed use development downtown but city officials are unsure whether its proposal will be accepted the city this year requested proposals for developing the land on the north side of superior street between clinton street and the club soda restaurant greg leatherman executive director of redevelopment said the city received one submission by this weeks deadline
2731247 though more study is needed leatherman said there are some initial concerns on the amount of public backing the development expects
2731248 they may have counted on more subsidy than we indicated were available
2731249 the level of personnel attending this summit from both it users and solution providers is first class were anticipating a superb gathering where executives can expect something different than a traditional trade show or analyst event
2731250 normal markets possess all four of these features clarity conviction cash and closings
2731251 today were lucky to have one even in the depths of the rtc crisis we had motivated sellers and opportunistic buyers who could find cash they closed on some unbelievable long term investments now everyone is foggy headed we have reluctant emotional sellers and buyers are acting like carrion beetles
2731252 lenders have increased pricing to the point that nothings getting done private equity groups are loaded with cash but why invest today when prices could be lower tomorrow tenants meanwhile are at a standstill retailers are scrapping plans to expand even closing stores and who wants to commit to more office space
2731253 and that can work for both lenders and developers for now theres nothing we can do about clarity but there is cash for high quality transactions and conviction is up to the individual investors who make money in this environment will be the ones who get three of the four cs theyll secure cash and because of strong conviction theyll see their deals through to closing
2731254 though you already know all this i want to remind you that the lord delivered his people out of egypt but later destroyed those who did not believe and the angels who did not keep their positions of authority but abandoned their own home these he has kept in darkness bound with everlasting chains for judgment on the great day in a similar way sodom and gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion they serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire

2731256 the italians have an intimidatory policy the idea is to scare immigrants so that when they go home they can tell their countrymen that italy is no place for foreigners

2731262 i wanted to go 4 03 i didnt know if i would
2731263 to be honest i didnt really feel that great and then going into the ready room i started getting chills up my body right then and there i was starting to get more and more excited i mean i was pretty emotional after that race and im pretty excited to have that first one under my belt
2731264 i wasnt comfortable after the first 200 after seeing everybody so close together
2731265 thats usually not how it as after the first 200 i think it made my breaststroke a lot stronger and at that point it was all adrenaline
2731266 i knew i had to go out fast in order to be in the race
2731267 if i was like a couple tenths slower on the backstroke i think i wouldve had a better shot i think that backstroke kind of took a lot out of me i did my best and i cant ask for anything else
2731268 i saw him after the race and he nodded and waved the american flag
2731269 its a pretty special feeling i waved and nodded my head back
2731270 i think were really happy with silver because i dont think we were even expecting to get that

2731287 people who would kill their sisters or daughters for bringing shame on the family would do anything to avoid being labeled a debtor

2731289 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2731290 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2731291 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2731292 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2731293 its really sad after the celebration of the opening ceremonies which were the best opening ceremonies ive ever been at
2731294 to the best of my knowledge this is a random action and not targeted at americans its just that you dont expect something to happen in a country like this
2731295 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families and the united states government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs
2731296 the chinese government will try not to let this event have a serious impact on u s china relations
2731297 im saddened but that doesnt make me think any less of this country
2731298 my feeling is that this has nothing to do with china
2731299 of course its a little scary but any time you have so many coming together there is a chance that something like this would happen

2731314 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2731315 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2731316 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2731317 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2731318 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2731319 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2731320 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2731321 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2731325 het is verschrikkelijk g nant en eenzaam als ik op straat word gevolgd door cameras die de aandacht trekken waarop mensen naar me wijzen en hun fototoestellen en telefoons richten op het tafereel
2731326 soms wordt het me te veel dus als je fotos ziet met de kop lily allen chagrijnig of lily allen weer in tranen weet dan dat het niet om mijn relatie gaat en dat ik geen kater heb het gaat erom dat ik alleen ben en mensen naar me wijzen alsof ik een dier in de dierentuin ben en tien tot twintig mannen daar hun geld mee verdienen

2731336 its going to come down to who has the hot hand and who matches up the best
2731337 i dont think this is a situation where you need to have complete games out of everyone the nice thing about this staff is they all bring something different
2731338 lisa was kind of our pitchers security blanket in greece
2731339 its time for these kids to step up and leave their own legacy
2731340 shes someone i totally admire because shes like a caged animal people are always watching her
2731341 theyre always wanting a piece of her and no matter what you get a smile and a happy face even if its not her best day or something is going wrong you would never know it i dont know if i could have the patience as much as people expect out of her but shes totally giving to the fans
2731342 i love the game and the impact that we are able to have on little girls is so incredible
2731343 thats the best feeling in the world leaving the park and knowing that you made some little girls day or helped them have a dream
2731344 you would never think that she was the international superstar that she is the way she carries herself
2731345 and i felt like my competitiveness would keep me on there but it was too much thats not my arena to be nasty or harsh it just wasnt me
2731346 people see the pretty face and they see her all over tv and dont realize how dominating she is on the field and what a great athlete she is
2731347 every day she pushed me i became a better athlete because of her
2731348 obviously we didnt start off great and we lacked a little bit of energy
2731349 when kara checked into the game it changed our defensive tone everyone plays off that energy she brings
2731350 coming off the bench you have the advantage of seeing the flow of the game
2731351 you can see what adjustments need to be made you can see what is and isnt working
2731352 i know how to help a team whether im playing 10 minutes or 30 minutes
2731353 i think that gives me a unique skill set that not a lot of players on this team have because most of them have always started and always played 30 minutes i know what its like to be the seventh or eighth player on the team this is an easy fit for me because ive played that role in my professional career
2731354 its the most important position for a lot of reasons
2731355 you have a team full of players who are used to having the ball in their hands at the end of the game and getting a lot of touches you have to be able to manage that and make everyone feel like theyre going to get the ball and score even though theyre not
2731356 when i watch tape i have as much fun watching whats happening on the floor as kara on the bench
2731357 the energy she brings on the court is just as contagious when shes on the bench thats when we talked about building this team having kara lawson was a must because she brings such a positive energy and it is contagious you cant go wrong with a player like that
2731358 whats different this time is that it was on home turf of course its more significant
2731359 i hope that this medal will open doors for more africans to come to the olympics as it shows we do have the confidence to come and win medals
2731360 since they have not succeeded in breaking my spirit the masks fell and we came to this arbitrary and illegal decision that tramples on any notion of justice and equity
2731361 it is these totalitarian practices and decisions that bring the sporting spirit and the olympic ideal that my country gave birth to into disrepute
2731362 the way the whole thing was manipulated there is no time we would have to seek an injunction against the events taking place and katerina certainly did not want that
2731363 this victory comes as a reward to everything i have been doing and everything i have already done its for all the people who believed in me and helped me on my return
2731364 he is playing with happiness and he is likely to keep improving in the next matches he is gaining his confidence back
2731365 we are all happy to have believed in his ability to return
2731366 and we are happier with the answer he has been giving us on the field
2731367 im happy for the victory and for helping brazil advance
2731368 its too early in brazil so i havent talked to him yet
2731369 this victory comes as a reward to everything i have been doing and everything i have already done its for all the people who believed in me and helped me on my return
2731370 he is playing with happiness and he is likely to keep improving in the next matches he is gaining his confidence back
2731371 we are all happy to have believed in his ability to return
2731372 and we are happier with the answer he has been giving us on the field
2731373 im happy for the victory and for helping brazil advance
2731374 its too early in brazil so i havent talked to him yet
2731375 im really happy with the way the first four races went and hopefully i can keep it going
2731376 its a really long regatta and theres a lot more racing left so hopefully i can just stay consistent and not have any big scores
2731377 i definitely just want to continue finishing in the top of the fleet i think that if you can just be in the top 10 you can put yourself into a good position
2731378 it feels great to be leading at the olympic games but you cant focus on one person though
2731379 ben is having a really good regatta as well he has two firsts and a fourth and he just got a bit unlucky in the first series
2731380 hes been on form hes sailing really well and its a long event so ill just keep concentrating on myself and keep doing what im doing and hopefully keep putting good results up
2731381 i tried everything that i could and i stayed to the left of him which i thought was the favorite side on the downwind but he just sailed a little better than i did down towards the finish and got by me and won the race
2731382 we have gone out drinking many times i have studied him not just in judo
2731383 it was he who gave us the opportunity to compete here
2731384 its all the same if its not a gold medal
2731385 she had more power and i tried to go against it i should have used it against her

2731420 and so dearest brothers let all attempts to call in question the divinely inspired faith be entirely put down
2731421 on the return of our brothers and fellow priests whom the see of blessed peter sent to the holy council
2731422 wherefore greeting your excellency with the affection of paternal charity we beg that all things which we have enjoined on our above named brother and fellow bishops to be done and observed may be carried out under the protection of your favor
2731423 bishop gregory servant of the servants of god to his beloved brother in christ hermann bishop of metz greeting and apostolic benediction
2731424 clement xi bishop servant of the servants of god being stirred up as well by the motives of our pastoral care but chiefly by the letters and entreaties of many venerable brothers especially the bishops of france
2731425 what heightens our sorrow is that some of you venerable brothers bishops and some of you dear sons pastors and missionaries are not ashamed of admitting almost without qualms of conscience such people to the sacraments
2731426 venerable brothers constantly preserve your steadfast resolution not your project for fear of danger
2731427 it is well known unto all men and especially to you venerable brothers with what great care and pastoral vigilance our predecessors the roman pontiffs have discharged the office entrusted by christ our lord to them in the person of the most blessed peter prince of the apostles
2731428 therefore venerable brothers as on former occasions when it seemed opportune to refute false teaching we have addressed you in the interests of the church and of the commonweal
2731429 craig will bring new energy to the flyers coaching staff
2731430 his knowledge of and experience with many of our young players will be invaluable
2731431 john paddock will bring tremendous experience and leadership to the phantoms we are fortunate to have john working with and helping to develop our young prospects
2731432 im very happy to get a chance to return to the nhl with the flyers
2731433 a year ago going back down to the phantoms as their head coach was a good opportunity for me to get experience and to show that i could be a head coach now getting a chance to go back to the nhl especially with the flyers is a good opportunity for me too
2731434 it wasnt something that i was planning on when it happened this late in the summer when paul called it was an opportunity that presented itself that i couldnt let go by there are so many people in the organization that ive worked with coached and played with that there were too many signs pointing to it being a good thing
2731435 the people in the stores they are so nice and helpful everything is possible for them you know they do everything to please you in france its not the same
2731436 you know the expression the customer is always right that to my opinion is the most american sentence and sentiment i have ever heard we should translate it into french and teach it to our shopkeepers
2731437 but extremely fit for a nation whose government is influenced by shopkeepers
2731438 the great success of a restaurant is built up on this principle the customer is always in the right
2731439 i am here at the restaurant merveillux since ten years other waiters stay mostly much shorter time perhaps they drink too much and so the signor gives them some sacks perhaps the temper of the signor has too much of the pepper for them
2731440 ukraine is anxious having received the information that the conflict in the south ossetia georgia has developed into a new phase with involving the military potential of the third party
2731441 unfortunately the information from the site indicates that the russian federation which had played a role of intermediary since a long time is gradually becoming a side of the conflict the foreign ministry of ukraine believes that it may aggravate the situation even more with broadening the conflict s geography and turning it into a regional one with unpredictable consequences
2731442 ukraine calls on the russian federation as permanent member of the un security council to pull out its troops from georgia to be reserved in its actions and to exert the necessary influence upon the separatist regime of tskhinvali in order to return to the bargaining table

2731457 she said unfortunately bad things happen in fort wayne ind where were from every day but we still go to coney island downtown we still go get gas we still go to wal mart
2731458 we cant live in fear or anger about what happened all you can do is send your prayers and sympathies to the family and try to continue what hugh would want us to do and thats try to win a gold medal
2731459 we know one thing theyre not going to start the game without us and we wanted to have a moment of silence where we could gather our thoughts it was a moment of silence to honor the bachmans hughs family its tough to change but we wanted to do it
2731460 ive played 15 years im married two kids i feel like im pretty much prepared for anything but nothing can prepare you for something like this
2731461 were playing a volleyball game out there nothing compares to the loss that happened to our team usa volleyball our whole delegation obviously we all came here to do this its very hard to continue on
2731462 nor would it be easy with him but i know hes supporting us
2731463 she said unfortunately bad things happen in fort wayne ind where were from every day but we still go to coney island downtown we still go get gas we still go to wal mart

2731465 sterker nog als dat mijn imago wordt dan kap ik er direct mee nee hyves is voor mij een goede manier om de jongeren te bereiken tegenwoordig lezen ze geen krant meer maar zitten ze wel iedere dag achter de computer op mijn pagina kan ik informatie kwijt over mijn werk bij stichting welzijn halsteren en het werkt ik krijg in ieder geval veel positieve reacties
2731466 ik krijg veel reacties de jongeren hebben zoiets van h wat leuk de ouderen zijn sceptisch dat is toch iets voor de jeugd dat klopt ook wel de gemiddelde leeftijd van mijn vrienden is bijvoorbeeld 23 het is echt iets van deze tijd
2731467 eenderde van de mensen kende mij voorheen niet veel wisten ook niet wat stichting welzijn halsteren allemaal doet eigenlijk gebruik ik hyves als extra kanaal om mensen te bereiken
2731468 ik merk dat de krabbels het meest worden gelezen mensen vinden het leuk om die berichtjes te lezen en te kijken wie er allemaal vriend zijn de blogs waar ik alle informatie inzet worden helaas wat minder gelezen daar moet ik dus nog wat aan doen
2731469 75 procent heeft bijvoorbeeld aangegeven dat er te weinig te doen is in het dorp daar moet dus wat aan gebeuren op hyves kan ik zien wie er gestemd hebben dat is een voordeel deze mensen kan ik dus actief benaderen om te zoeken naar een oplossing
2731470 ouders hebben geen flauw idee wat hun kinderen op internet uitspoken ze weten niet wat voor gevaren er schuilen in zoiets als hyves jongeren zetten er hun hele priv leven op ook met fotos en filmpjes niet echt verstandig iemand kan er ook misbruik van maken bedrijven raadplegen tegenwoordig het internet bij sollicitaties ze hebben dan al een beeld over iemand terwijl die nog niet eens op gesprek is geweest maar hyves wordt ook gebruikt om te pesten onlangs is een meisje ermee gestopt omdat haar ex vriendje haar via de site bestookte met vervelende berichtjes hyves is een machtig medium maar er zitten dus wel haken en ogen aan
2731471 de beste manier om te strijden tegen fraude op het internet blijft de waakzaamheid van de gebruikers verhogen
2731472 als je een mail krijgt die je wijsmaakt dat je op een of andere manier veel geld kan verdienen ga er niet op in en maak zeker geen afspraak
2731473 overdag ben ik gewoon w d tso bso leraar nederlands geschiedenis en maatschappelijke vorming maar s avonds verander ik in cookiemonster dan chat ik via messenger met wel honderd leerlingen en oud leerlingen in mijn contactlijst in het begin van het schooljaar schrijf ik mijn hotmail adres en gsm nummer op het bord maar ik heb weinig last van junkmail of hijgtelefoons als je je leerlingen met respect behandelt krijg je respect terug
2731474 mijn zoon 16 vertelde me dat n van de jonge leraressen gewoon mee in hun chatgroep zat ze had hem onder andere gevraagd eens wat van zijn lievelingsmuziek door te sturen ze mailde terug dat ze het mottige negermuziek vond hij vond het vreemd dat ze zijn muziek niet goed vond ik vroeg me af welk waardepatroon zon lerares op die manier doorgeeft
2731475 leerkrachten stappen op chat of per sms snel af van hun voorbeeldfunctie die ze wel hebben scholen zouden er goed aan doen leerkrachten en leerlingen te wijzen op netetiquette die bij dat soort van contact van kracht is het is zeker iets om alert voor te zijn
2731476 we geven de scholen ook specifiek het advies mee al hun media misbruikvrij te maken en ook leerlingen de mogelijkheid te geven misbruik van leerkrachten of medeleerlingen anoniem via de site te kunnen melden
2731477 ik werd op de duur echt gestalkt ik had een leerling in de klas met nogal wat gezinsproblemen na een persoonlijk gesprek zei ik dat ze me altijd mocht bellen of mailen als het te erg werd dat had ik nooit mogen doen het begon met een braaf smsje maar al snel verschenen er berichten als ik ga zelfmoord plegen help me soms kwamen die berichten midden in de nacht uiteindelijk heb ik de directie moeten inlichten
2731478 zulke gevallen zijn ons inderdaad gemeld van leraars die gestalkt worden
2731479 leraars worden heel snel in de positie van hulpverlener gedrukt terwijl ze daar niet voor bevoegd zijn ook omgekeerd moet een leraar zijn grenzen goed bewaken wij raden aan meteen eisen en structuur vast te leggen en in geen geval zelf chattaal te beginnen te gebruiken
2731480 digitaal contact heeft in het onderwijs zeker voordelen je kunt je leerlingen op een informele manier interesseren in het onderwerp en taalarme leerlingen zijn veel meer geneigd via mail te communiceren maar er zijn ook valkuilen en daar zijn leraren zich vaak te weinig van bewust
2731481 maar dat had niks met huiswerk te maken ik heb moeite met wiskunde frans en natuurkunde de andere cijfers waren wel gewoon voldoende
2731482 ik ben inderdaad in de problemen gekomen omdat ik nooit frans leerde had ik een 5 als eindcijfer en nog een paar lage cijfers ik wilde meer doen maar omdat ik teveel achter de pc zit lukte dit niet
2731483 jongeren geven het zelf aan tijdens gesprekken het telkens wisselen van activiteiten gaat ten koste van concentratie daar komt bij multitasking vergroot de sociale druk jongeren willen hun contacten bijhouden via mobieltje en laptop maar ze moeten ook nog studeren dat knelt een dag heeft te weinig uren voor ze
2731484 huiswerk maken met een ipod is multitasken autorijden waarbij je op alle verkeer en borden moet letten en ook nog naar de radio luisteren is multitasken gelukkig dat we een brein hebben dat dat mogelijk maakt
2731485 multitasken kost mentale inspanning energie je wordt er moe van
2731486 het internetgebruik reguleren of toezichtprogrammas op de pc installeren nee straffen door ze geen zakgeld te geven heeft geen zin de meeste jongeren hebben een baantje
2731487 vertel kinderen hoe ze hun huiswerk moeten plannen voor ze los gaan op internet
2731488 kinderen melden zelf dat internet het huiswerk in de weg staat multitasken is heel lastig daar zijn onze hersens niet op ingesteld probeer maar eens twee gesprekken tegelijk te voeren of tegelijk drie verhalen in de kroeg te volgen
2731489 de tijd die iemand vroeger voetbalde na schooltijd kon hij ook niet aan zijn huiswerk besteden precies zo is het met chatten en msn en hersenen zijn niet oneindig rekbaar maar de huidige maatschappij vraagt wel om multitasking het kan ook wel tot op zekere hoogte omdat hersenen zich blijven aanpassen niet dat alle combinaties mogelijk zijn zingen en schrijven gaan niet samen schilderen met muziek op de achtergrond al een stuk beter
2731490 de huidige puberhersens kunnen echt niet binnen een paar jaar z zijn aangepast aan het media bombardement dat ze ineens taken gelijktijdig kunnen uitvoeren met behoud van kwaliteit wie gelooft dat dat wel kan stopt met opvoeden in het plannen van taken en discipine en doet pubers dan juist tekort ik zie leerlingen in een vmbo klas die daar niet thuishoren ze zijn teruggezet van vwo of havo een stapje terug kunnen ze wel die dingen op hun pc erbij doen
2731491 het gaat goed op het vmbo mavo hoef ik ook niet zoveel te doen
2731492 gokken heeft mij altijd al ge ntrigeerd toen ik klein was probeerde ik het roulettespel te doorgronden om er geld mee te kunnen verdienen maar dat lukt natuurlijk niet enkele jaren geleden ontdekte ik online poker en daar kun je wel geld mee verdienen je speelt immers niet tegen het casino maar tegen andere spelers en die zijn meestal zodanig slecht dat je op lange termijn gemakkelijk winst kan maken
2731493 ik doe gewoon wat ik graag doe en kijk niet te veel vooruit momenteel heb ik een vijfjarenplan ik wil nog minstens vijf jaar doen wat ik nu doe en dan zie ik wel weer misschien iets zelfstandig oprichten of zo financieel gezien moet ik me momenteel toch geen zorgen maken
2731494 en ik ben dan nog maar een kleine vis in vergelijking met de chte gokkers
2731495 ik zou nu niet meer kunnen stoppen met gokken ben ik dan verslaafd ja natuurlijk maar ik doe het niet voor de kick dat is het probleem bij de meeste mensen ze willen snel grote winsten maken en zetten dan ook te hoge bedragen in maar zo werkt het natuurlijk niet je moet klein beginnen en langzamerhand beter worden ik speel nu online nog altijd voor inzetten van 0 5 en 1 maar dan wel op zes tafels tegelijk op dat niveau zijn de spelers toch zodanig slecht dat dat perfect mogelijk is
2731496 uiteraard is het zo dat geluk steeds een factor blijft bij poker iedereen heeft wel eens een hele avond slechte kaarten en daar moet je mee kunnen omgaan maar op lange termijn zal iedereen ongeveer dezelfde kaarten krijgen en het is dan dat de goede spelers komen bovendrijven
2731497 net als sven ben ik begonnen met een free bankroll van 50 en al snel had ik daar 600 van gemaakt maar toen begon het fout te gaan ik speelde voor te hoge inzetten en verwaarloosde mijn studies je pokert nu eenmaal niet voor maar een uurtje als je pokert ben je meteen weg voor een paar uur ik speelde al mijn geld weer kwijt en besloot toen om te stoppen met online poker
2731498 het voornaamste probleem is dat de jeugd momenteel met poker opgroeit kinderen spelen op de speelplaats voor bedragen van 5 het probleem is ook dat er absoluut geen duidelijke wetgeving bestaat rond pokertoernooien of online poker
2731499 ik zeg al 6 jaar dat er een nieuwe wet moet komen de oude wetgeving dateert van 1999 en is hopeloos verouderd maar laten we duidelijk zijn poker is en blijft een kansspel en is dus illegaal
2731500 in theorie voeren we een zero tolerance beleid maar in de praktijk is het uiteraard zo dat we ons vooral concentreren op spelen waar frauduleuze praktijken zoals witwasserij bij komen kijken vorige week zijn we nog binnengevallen in een caf aan het stadion van k a a gent waar een pokertoernooi werd georganiseerd door de uitbater de straffen lopen van boetes van 100 tot 100 000 en gevangenisstraffen van 6 maand tot 5 jaar
2731501 wij spelen toch vooral online en die sites opereren meestal vanuit kleine landjes dus daar is sowieso weinig tegen te beginnen
2731502 wij willen een soort kwaliteitslabel cre ren voor sites die gegarandeerd veilig zijn samen met een reclameverbod moet dat ervoor zorgen dat de mensen die online spelen de illegale sites links laten liggen
2731503 theres an m amp m in everyone create an inner m character that looks just like you
2731504 deze jongeren antwoorden ja op vragen als vind je het moeilijk om te stoppen ben je er nog steeds mee bezig als je n et achter de computer zit
2731505 in een game zit een belonend aspect je kunt op een steeds hoger niveau komen
2731506 het zit ook heel erg ingebakken in de jeugdcultuur maar ik sluit niet uit dat je ook daaraan verslaafd kunt raken
2731507 we feel that a customer would want to buy products that cesar recommends since hes a specialist in his field
2731508 the lord is showing his anger at the desecration of his church
2731509 god is going to destroy us for our deviant ways
2731510 saw something in the times about it old chap seems theres charabancs full of happy clappies pouring into st wilfreds and trampling on the family brasses what nonsense
2731511 people are saying its god showing his displeasure at the vicars modernisation scheme ripping out the organ and the pews and so on
2731512 you dont believe that rot do you its a call to arms to the forsbury family of course countrys going to the dogs its up to me now you know im the last of the forsburys
2731513 the electrician dropped his tea when he was working on the lights

2731516 youve done really well to get this far rach youve done the really hard bit slogging up to here now the ridge should climb itself
2731517 i really want to craig but my legs are telling me theyll strike if i push them any harder
2731518 in summer theres a queue up the ridge and the summit is heaving but they dont know what they are missing look
2731519 its about fifty miles away but you could almost count the sheep on snaefell and that
2731520 is the coast of galloway and the other way you can even see the welsh mountains you wont see that too often
2731521 if i had a way of stopping time for ever at a moment of my choosing id choose now
2731522 if were to get back to the tent before it gets dark
2731523 and then weve all the time we need for each other
2731524 ill go ahead and find the way through and then ill call you
2731525 that doesnt matter ill drive you home you need looking after well sort things out later
2731526 but he showed me life more life than you could ever give me
2731527 the original vision at the heart of shared worlds has always been the desire to provide a place where oddball kids like me could get together and play with ideas
2731528 if you want perfection you have to pay for it
2731529 hem verliezen is iets als 12 mensen verliezen zo groots was hij
2731530 ik betreur het verlies van een man die ongelofelijk grappig was en helemaal voor zijn familie leefde
2731531 we moeten dat allemaal controleren we vertrouwen de georgi rs niet
2731532 during the last four days more than 100 militants have been killed and nine security personnel have also died
2731533 the troops casualties may rise as some of their soldiers were missing
2731534 in the past month i have been in so much pain and i havent been able to practise for 10 days
2731535 i havent even hit a ball since arriving in beijing
2731536 it was very exciting sitting there this morning watching michael phelps set a world record was special to me because it made me realize how many people are inspired by him
2731537 now im in the position to have that opportunity to go out there and get a medal for my country today was hopefully the first step towards that
2731538 but i hate sports and i hate the olympics and my boyfriend is ignoring me
2731539 this reminds me all too much of other recent conflicts that have torn our continent apart particularly in the balkans
2731540 we have left practically all of south ossetia as an expression of goodwill and our willingness to stop military confrontation
2731541 we have asked united states secretary of state condoleezza rice to mediate with the russians to transmit them our message
2731542 has already caused a great number of innocent victims and forced a great number of civilians to leave their homes
2731543 refrain also in the name of the common christian heritage from further confrontations and violent retaliations that could degenerate into a wider conflict
2731544 how much does it pain my heart and my soul to announce to the palestinian people the arab and islamic world and to everyone who loves peace and freedom the passing of the star of palestine
2731545 the absence of our great poet mahmud darwish the love of palestine and the pioneer of the modern palestinian cultural project will leave a great void in our cultural political and national life
2731546 darwish is the essential breath of the palestinian people the eloquent witness of exile and belonging
2731547 before anything mahmud darwish was a great poet who possessed real poetic power
2731548 he quickly became the national palestinian poet the poet of the exile and of the refugees
2731549 deprives the palestinians and all the arabs of one of their most noted representatives for contemporary poetry and culture
2731550 with his poetry darwish transcended all the frontiers and broke the chains of narrow patriotism in order to become the voice of palestine
2731551 the exercise of justice is joy for the righteous but is terror to the workers of iniquity
2731552 the district attorneys office represents the community but only if the community is willing to cooperate
2731553 those who shouldnt be on the sex offender list at all

2731559 if we our chief justice our officials or any of our servants offend in any respect against any man or transgress any of the articles of the peace or of this security and the offence is made known to four of the said twenty five barons they shall come to us or in our absence from the kingdom to the chief justice to declare it and claim immediate redress
2731560 that is the right of subjects to petition the king and all commitments and prosecutions for such petitioning are illegal
2731561 i dont have to practice what i preach because im not the kind of person to whom im preaching
2731562 in this form the first grand right is that of the people having a share in their own government by their representatives chosen by themselves if money is wanted by rulers who have in any manner oppressed the people they may retain it until their grievances are redressed and thus peaceably procure relief without trusting to despised petitions or disturbing the public tranquility
2731563 um destino muito procurado ao longo do ano costumamos fechar pacotes com grupos entre 25 e 30 pessoas
2731564 com certeza o local ser valorizado o essencial deve ser preservado mas n o se pode imobilizar a cidade

2731566 a receptividade do ginga interessante vendo mais desse aparelho do que outros
2731567 os estados unidos ficar o furiosos se os avi es russos bombardearem uma base onde o pent gono tem conselheiros militares
2731568 mas george w bush um presidente em fim de mandato n o vai querer arriscar uma terceira guerra mundial por causa da ge rgia
2731569 os russos invadiram o territ rio georgiano e isso algo real mas n o creio que o objetivo deles seja destruir completamente as capacidades militares da ge rgia uma demonstra o russa para enfraquecer a capacidade dos georgianos
2731570 a escalada militar poss vel mas n o estou certa que seja inevit vel porque ningu m est realmente interessado a r ssia n o est interessada numa escalada da viol ncia porque al m do c ucaso do sul h tamb m um c ucaso do norte com risco de expans o da crise
2731571 nem a uni o europ ia nem os estados unidos querem enviar for as militares regi o
2731572 um caso entre a ge rgia e a oss tia do sul quanto entre estados unidos e r ssia
2731573 a r ssia se op e violentamente ao fato de que a ge rgia se converta em membro da otan e os estados unidos chegaram a enfrentar a r ssia em rela o a este tema
2731574 e se a ge rgia cair sob influ ncia russa as esperan as europ ias de uma independ ncia energ tica da r ssia desaparecer o
2731575 we must check all that we dont trust the georgian side
2731576 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2731577 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2731578 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2731579 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2731580 complete genocide mr putin also said georgia had effectively lost the right to rule the breakaway province an indication moscow could be preparing to fulfill south ossetians wish to be absorbed into russia
2731581 acreditamos que obama vai ganhar porque a culmina o da era a favor das minorias nos eua mas isso vai gerar um contra ataque dos brancos e at uma revolu o
2731582 para n s uma luta da maioria branca contra a tirania das minorias essa era trouxe dist rbios pobreza chantagem assassinatos e poder pol tico para as minorias
2731583 muitos brancos votar o em obama mas se dar o conta de seu erro voltar o a defender os direitos da maioria e a exigir uma mudan a
2731584 votar o em obama com a esperan a de que isso lhes ajude a impulsionar uma revolu o branca
2731585 os supremacistas acham que uma vit ria de obama seria como um grito de batalha dos brancos e que milh es se unir o em sua causa e armar o a revolu o
2731586 seria um s mbolo da decad ncia do pa s e do mal pelo qual os brancos est o passando
2731587 estes grupos dizem que se sentem v timas discriminados e marginalizados e dizem se ressentir das prefer ncias concedidas s minorias acham que se a sociedade continuar enfatizando a identidade racial ent o mais e mais brancos se sentir o no direito de defender a sua
2731588 claro sinal para milh es de americanos brancos de que n o se d o conta
2731589 se uma pessoa branca defende sua heran a cultural a mesma que fundou este pa s ent o a chamam de racista
2731590 ele traduzia a dor dos palestinos de forma m gica ele nos fazia chorar e nos fazia feliz e mexia com nossas emo es
2731591 al m de ser o poeta da ferida palestina que est machucando todos os rabes e todas as pessos honestas no mundo ele um poeta magistral
2731592 a quest o palestina na poesia de mahmoud darwish n o era mais uma lenda mas uma hist ria sobre pessoas feitas de carne sangue e sentimentos
2731593 a pol tica da ind stria baseada na preval ncia da doen a e na renda m dia mas o que defendemos o pre o justo que leve em conta outros fatores como o fato de um pa s garantir acesso universal vamos buscar uma redistribui o de pre os

2731595 n o tenho medo do povo melhor se submeter ao povo do que a certos interesses internos e externos
2731596 a partir de hoje a maior parte da cidade tskhinvali est controlada pelas for as de paz da r ssia
2731597 comandantes militares tomaram a decis o de retirada de tskhinvali nesta manh
2731598 n s lamentamos as a es perigosas e desproporcionais das for as russas e ficaremos particularmente preocupados se esses ataques continuarem agora que os georgianos est o se retirando
2731599 eu tenho esperan a de que a a o militar ir parar imediatamente e que eles v o se abster em nome da heran a crist em comum de mais combates e viol ncia
2731600 os tanques da ge rgia atiraram contra tudo o que viram incluindo mulheres e crian as
2731601 ele traduzia a dor dos palestinos de forma m gica ele nos fazia chorar e nos fazia feliz e mexia com nossas emo es
2731602 al m de ser o poeta da ferida palestina que est machucando todos os rabes e todas as pessos honestas no mundo ele um poeta magistral
2731603 a quest o palestina na poesia de mahmoud darwish n o era mais uma lenda mas uma hist ria sobre pessoas feitas de carne sangue e sentimentos
2731604 n o tenho medo da oposi o depois de ter feito uma profunda reflex o desses anos
2731605 seus escritos id ias e criatividade manter o viva sua mensagem para esta gera o e para as que est o por vir
2731606 poeta da terra e da vida s mbolo da identidade nacional palestina e da cultura humana
2731607 im filing a 10 million libel action and i dont think you want ap to be part of that
2731608 its a story of courage of a very brave service dog taking care of me he passed away i was so depressed i had him cloned
2731609 that i would ski naked down mount everest in the nude with a carnation up my nose if he asked me to
2731610 i have been played up as a very wicked and perverted woman
2731611 as someone who has been working in the travel industry since 1981 ive never even after 9 11 seen conditions this severe
2731612 the scarlett ohara fiddle dee dee ill think about this tomorrow mentality wont work
2731613 i think its more difficult for people that are young
2731614 theyre trying to raise a family they have huge mortgages
2731615 i can see them having trouble going to the grocery store
2731616 more important this year than even years past to book as early as you can
2731617 you have to be aware that not all of the cuts have come into play yet
2731618 they remind us that even though it is dark out there are still people fighting cancer out there
2731619 its a time of remembrance its the most solemn part of the evening
2731620 should we adopt a posture of indolent acquiescence we incliners along with the rest of america would be the only ones responsible for perpetuating the energy morass we got ourselves into in the first place
2731621 there are so many volunteers in our community who deserve to be recognized for their efforts the bonanza is pleased to be able to showcase these locals who have given so much
2731622 i kept saying i hope i get this in i hope i get this in
2731623 i got 140 pounds of filet off it im still giving it away
2731624 so many people have called to ask if the pictures are real
2731625 i cant say exactly what percentage of our decision it will be i dont have a formula
2731626 one of the problems is that youve forgotten your closest neighbors are on the california side
2731627 the traffic of this project is so over the top it will make me a prisoner in my own home
2731628 i feel just as strongly that the original project and its proposed road options were a good option
2731629 shouldnt one of our options be to keep reservoir road
2731630 i still see our best option is to keep what we still have
2731631 we find that people who may not speak up in larger group situations feel more comfortable in smaller groups
2731632 were struggling for a budget to get the word out and the bonanza has been very helpful in its coverage and forums
2731633 from what search and rescue can tell there isnt anything pointing toward other passengers
2731634 there werent any other prints or luggage at the plane that would point to any other people besides the pilot
2731635 nevada county actually received the transmissions first and alerted aircraft from the nevada civil air patrol
2731636 i recall getting up last night about 2 a m because the wind was shaking my trailer
2731637 considering this was my first year in office im pleased with my performance score
2731638 i think im on the right track and were working at the court here on the things we can improve
2731639 we certainly try for our court to be very fair and it helps that we have terrific deputy district attorneys and the public defender who comes up here does an excellent job as does all of the private counsel we see
2731640 i sang unafraid by joy williams because it is about not being afraid of challenges
2731641 we had a lot of feedback from last year and we are changing the format a little by having a four minute time limit
2731642 neighborhood compatibility is a term that has always meant zoning
2731643 this appeal made a pitch that the neighborhood compatibility meant more than that and that the scale of the project wasnt compatible with the neighborhood
2731644 this new decision could interfere with individual property rights and the ability to take a home and remodel it its so subjective it is onerous and flies in the face of all the existing rules people have been abiding by
2731645 it limits what people can do with their land and therefore decreases the value of the property
2731646 since the decision was a project vote and not a policy decision the decision does not represent a shift in policy and trpa staff is continuing to process single family home applications
2731647 trpa staff is requesting policy direction from the governing board at its aug 27 meeting in stateline regarding the preservation of residential character
2731648 trpa staff will provide the board with data on neighborhood character to aid in the discussion but no code changes will be proposed at the august meeting
2731649 id say the majority of them will have paddleboarded only about two or three times before they cross the lake
2731650 one of the things about this is that it shows how you can do anything if you put your mind to it
2731651 its going to be a challenge to do it but its for the woodruff foundation so its for a good cause
2731652 itll bring awareness and its with a good group of guys so it should be fun
2731653 i dont know i dont think you can really get ready for the lake tahoe crossing in three or four attempts
2731654 my hands got a little raw from the constant paddling
2731655 ive never done it before so i figured id give it a shot im not an endurance guy so well see what happens but i think a lot of the other guys will be struggling too
2731656 its pretty cool though its a good balance exercise and a great reason to get out on the water and cruise around
2731657 im hoping the wind picks up so i can surf out there

2731664 i called him and said you may want to get checked out
2731665 he strongly encouraged me to seek proton therapy treatments at loma linda university
2731666 i would not have known about this type of treatment
2731667 there are little or no side effects from this type of treatment
2731668 he said we are just fine and there is no need to return
2731669 it was great to fly up for the weekends from orange county

2731692 i was here alone in a house on the isle of patmos for several weeks to pray and seek the lord
2731693 i wonder if the lord will ever send a tenth angel
2731694 but it was not so one night i even dreamt about an angel he told me to fly in my dream and i did but that was only a dream i wanted to see a real angel as i had seen nine times before
2731695 my church you preach love you teach love but you need to practice love to show love there is need of unity in my body there are many divisions among you my spirit will not move and work where there is no unity there is carnality in my church too much uncleanness in my church i desire and i want a holy people i died to made you holy
2731696 there shall be disaster starvation many will die from hunger strong winds will be looked like has never happened before a great part shall be shaken and destroyed earthquakes will take place all over asia and the sea will cover the earth
2731697 this was frightening i wondered whether i was hearing right but the angel said
2731698 financial crisis will come to asia i will shake the world
2731699 all of turkey and those inaudible countries that have refused me and refused my message of love shall hate each other and kill one another
2731700 the chosen the church the remnant shall be purified the spirit of god shall prepare the children of god
2731701 i am grieved i am grieved unrighteousness uncleanness ungodliness all over europe the sin has risen to heaven the holy spirit is grieved
2731702 innocent blood has been shed divisions amongst the people generations far from the lord they have killed one another thousands of people i have seen my faithful children in africa and i shall reward all the faithful in the continent of africa i shall bless them abundantly i shall control the weather scorching and burning of the sun in some parts great rivers shall dry up and millions will die from starvation in other parts flooding foundations shall be shaken my sword shall judge the unrighteous and the bloodthirsty so many earthquakes shall happen that rivers shall flow different directions in the continent flooding many villages

2731704 it is all bad news all destruction any good news
2731705 the final day has come judgment day is here my love has been refused now and the end has come
2731706 can you not wait for a little while dont pour it give a chance for repentance
2731707 many times god has spared and has spoken but they have not listened his patience has come to an end beware the time has come they have loved money and pleasure more than they have loved me
2731708 cant you postpone dont pour these things out all over the globe
2731709 13 but i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope 14 for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him 15 for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep 16 for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first 17 then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord 18 wherefore comfort one another with these words
2731710 1 but of the times and the seasons brethren ye have no need that i write unto you 2 for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night 3 for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape 4 but ye brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief 5 ye are all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of darkness 6 therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober 7 for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken in the night 8 but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for an helmet the hope of salvation 9 for god hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our lord jesus christ 10 who died for us that whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him 11 wherefore comfort yourselves together and edify one another even as also ye do
2731711 22 but ye are come unto mount zion and unto the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels 23 to the general assembly and church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to god the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect 24 and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of abel 25 see that ye refuse not him that speaketh for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven 26 whose voice then shook the earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven 27 and this word yet once more signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain 28 wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear 29 for our god is a consuming fire

2731721 methane gas is made in real time every day and the alberta government was only given legal ownership of non renewable resources
2731722 we have got the challenge registered in the court and the only way we can proceed is to get membership and funding behind us
2731723 the process relies on coal as a feed stock and the feed stock the coal seam is actually limited its finite presumbly there would be a finite amount of methane that could be generated so i think that question will need to be addressed as part of this process as well
2731724 they can take an area that is already producing and without my authority or say so start producing coalbed methane
2731725 we have had issue in the past here with pipeline rupture that sort of thing contaminating some of the soil
2731726 i want to have the right to say no to a cbm coalbed methane well but i also want the right to be able to if i want to develop a cbm well i can develop it

2731743 none besides the obvious ones that come with such a relationship
2731744 we need evangelicals to become evangelistic too many pastors have stopped giving invitations to accept christ at the end of a sermon because they dont want to put pressure on people one of our conventions largest distractions from witnessing winning and baptizing one million people is that we have lost our focus on the main thing we are not urging our people to do evangelism we are not equipping and teaching them to do evangelism in effective and comprehensive ways
2731745 one we train and equip the christian community on how to effectively reach out to those who are lost second we put our training into action through participation in evangelistic visitation efforts organized by the local churches we believe that if you witness you win if you dont you lose witnessing is an expression of love concern and care to those around us beginning with family and friends third we help new christians understand and appreciate the joy and obedience of believers baptism fourth we learn and apply gods biblical teaching of stewardship for the expansion of his kingdom fifth we personally involve ourselves with vacation bible school because we are convinced that we must reach our children and their parents for christ sixth we encourage the effort to start new sunday school classes and or new churches
2731746 all the people are exactly the same it doesnt matter what a persons religious background is what their sin background is or what their political background is if the holy spirit is working in that person and working in you and youve got the gospel and you know how to effectively and comprehensively share it people are open to hear it
2731747 while we may be doctrinally sound we need to be more active doers of the word what wont work is if the church thinks evangelism is people bringing their friends to church and letting the pastor preach to them and hopefully lead them to the lord that wont work the key to the future in north america for the evangelical church is to equip the saints to do the work of the ministry
2731748 one of my greatest fears is that we in america are going to somehow begin to think that if we vote right politically that relieves us from our evangelistic responsibilities
2731749 if we just get the right man in office then god is going to bless us
2731750 god is not going to bless ungodliness period does that mean god cannot use different people to do different things to do his work well hes used roosters and hes used mules and a lot of different things he could use anybody but hes not going to use someone to their full potential if that person is not living a righteous life i do think pornography is part of the problem we are absolutely inundated with internet pornography inundated we are a society heavily distracted not focusing on god

2731800 its not right for me to comment on this a film is a by product of the energies and efforts of a lot of people on hindsight you can point out many mistakes but you can never be sure about the fate of a movie from before it releases
2731801 the film is about the economic disparity in the country how the rich are getting richer while the poor are becoming poorer sushi ganeshan is the director while vikram is my co actor i had a good time doing the film its a commercial film but at the same time deals with a topic that is so true of india

2731812 despite efforts to improve the environment inside detention facilities the fundamental problem with immigration detention has not changed namely the length of detention and the uncertainty about how much longer that detention will last hreoc staff met many detainees who expressed extreme frustration about the length of time they had been detained and discussions with mental health teams confirmed what is already well known the uncertainty and length of detention inevitably leads to mental health problems hreoc staff met some detainees who were starting to suffer symptoms after just months of detention
2731813 onshore asylum seekers still need to be treated with the dignity that they deserve to do this several policies need to be reformed dramatically first australias mandatory detention policy should be abolished while the conditions in detention centres have improved and children have been released into alternative forms of detention the fact remains that the policy breaches australias human rights obligations

2731821 scrutiny by the media can influence both government action and public opinion
2731822 websites can provide news and information than can deepen members understanding to the point where they move to participate in the campaigns of the organization
2731823 the archbishops council met last week to propose a solution
2731824 in february the government also banned the press from freely covering the arrival in the country of papuan refugees generally speaking numerous restrictions are imposed on journalists wanting to cover the plight of people in australias camps for asylum seekers
2731825 australias mandatory detention policy should be abolished while the conditions in detention centres have improved and children have been released into alternative forms of detention the fact remains that the policy breaches australias human rights obligations we still have a situation where people who arrive on excised australian territory can be taken to nauru and left there indefinitely these asylum seekers are denied access to free legal assistance and judicial review of their asylum claims and there is still no independent scrutiny of the conditions of the detention centre in nauru
2731826 the main problem is that it has been slanted to give the impression that the prime minister and senior ministers knew that no children had been thrown overboard and deliberately lied during the election campaign to give a false impression this view is not supported by the inquiry or by anyone who actually took part in the events
2731827 to engage public servants to go out there an re edit history it strikes me as odd to say the least
2731828 the prime minister did not ask any of his staff or his department to make any changes or edits to wikipedia

2731838 some people cannot take the brutal truth and that sort of language

2731949 dan mereka isteri isterimu telah mengambil dari kamu perjanjian yang kuat
2731950 barangsiapa menikah maka ia telah melengkapi separuh dari agamanya dan hendaklah ia bertaqwa kepada allah dalam memelihara yang separuhnya lagi
2731951 rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wassalam memerintahkan kami untuk menikah dan melarang kami membujang dengan larangan yang keras
2731952 nikahilah wanita yang subur dan penyayang karena aku akan berbangga dengan banyaknya umatku di hadapan umat umat lain
2731953 benarkah kalian telah berkata begini dan begitu sungguh demi allah sesunguhnya akulah yang paling takut dan taqwa kepada allah diantara kalian akan tetapi aku berpuasa dan aku berbuka aku shalat dan aku juga tidur dan aku juga menikahi wanita maka barangsiapa yang tidak menyukai sunnahku maka ia tidak termasuk golonganku
2731954 dan nikahkanlah orang orang yang sendirian diantara kamu dan orang orang yang layak menikah dari hamba hamba sahayamu yang laki laki dan wanita jika mereka miskin allah akan memampukan mereka dengan karunia nya dan allah maha luas pemberian nya lagi maha mengetahui
2731955 ada tiga golongan manusia yang berhak mendapat pertolongan allah yaitu mujahid fi sabilillah budak yang menebus dirinya supaya merdeka dan orang yang menkah karena ingin memelihara kehormatannya
2731956 wahai para pemuda barangsiapa diantara kalian berkemampuan untuk menikah maka nikahlah karena nikah itu lebih menundukkan pandangan dan lebih membentengi farji kemaluan dan barangsiapa yang tidak mampu maka hendaklah ia puasa karena puasa itu dapat membentengi dirinya
2731957 thalaq yang dapat dirujuki dua kali setelah itu boleh rujuk lagi dengan cara maruf atau menceraikan dengan cara yang baik tidak halal bagi kamu mengambil kembali dari sesuatu yang telah kamu berikan kepada mereka kecuali kalau keduanya khawatir tidak akan dapat menjalankan hukum hukum allah jika kamu khawatir keduanya suami isteri tidak dapat menjalankan hukum hukum allah maka tidak ada dosa atas keduanya tentang pembayaran yang diberikan oleh isteri untuk menebus dirinya itulah hukum hukum allah maka janganlah kamu melanggarnya barangsiapa yang melanggar hukum hukum allah mereka itulah orang orang yang zhalim
2731958 hai manusia sesungguhnya kami menciptakan kamu dari seorang laki laki dan seorang wanita dan menjadikan kamu berbangsa bangsa dan bersuku suku supaya kamu saling kenal mengenal sesungguhnya orang yang paling mulia diantara kamu di sisi allah ialah orang orang yang paling bertaqwa diantara kamu sesungguhnya allah maha mengetahui lagi maha mengenal
2731959 seorang wanita dinikahi karena empat hal karena hartanya keturunannya kecantikannya dan agamanya maka hendaklah kamu pilih wanita yang taat agamanya ke islamannya niscaya kamu akan beruntung
2731960 wanita wanita yang keji untuk laki laki yang keji dan laki laki yang keji adalah buat wanita wanita yang keji pula dan wanita wanita yang baik untuk laki laki yang baik dan laki laki yang baik untuk wanita wanita yang baik pula
2731961 wanita yang shalihah ialah yang taat kepada allah lagi memelihara diri bila suami tidak ada sebagaimana allah telah memelihara mereka
2731962 allah telah menjadikan dari diri diri kamu itu pasangan suami isteri dan menjadikan bagimu dari isteri isteri kamu itu anak anak dan cucu cucu dan memberimu rezeki yang baik baik maka mengapakah mereka beriman kepada yang bathil dan mengingkari nikmat allah
2731963 hendaklah kalian mencampuri isteri kalian dan berusaha untuk memperoleh anak
2731964 dan diantara tanda tanda kekuasaan allah ialah dia menciptakan untukmu isteri isteri dari jenismu sendiri supaya kamu cenderung dan merasa tentram kepadanya dan dijadikan nya diantara kamu rasa kasih dan saying sesungguhnya pada yang demikian itu benar benar terdapat tanda tanda bagi kaum yang berpikir
2731965 ya rabbku anugerahkanlah kepadaku seorang anak yang termasuk orang orang yang shalih
2731966 ya rabb kami anugerahkanlah kepada kami isteri isteri kami dan keturunan kami sebagai penyenang hati kami dan jadikanlah kami imam bagi orang orang yang bertaqwa
2731967 ya rabbku janganlah engkau membiarkan aku hidup seorang diri dan engkaulah waris yang paling baik
2731968 ya rasulullah apa hak seorang isteri yang harus dipenuhi oleh suaminya
2731969 hai orang orang yang beriman peliharalah dirimu dan keluargamu dari api neraka yang bahan bakarnya terbuat dari manusia dan batu penjaganya adalah malaikat malaikat yang kasar lagi keras yang tidak mendurhakai perintah allah terhadap apa yang diperintahkan nya kepada mereka dan selalu mengerjakan apa yang diperintahkan
2731970 kalau seandainya aku boleh menyuruh seorang sujud kepada seseorang maka aku akan perintahkan seorang wanita sujud kepada suaminya
2731971 apabila seorang wanita mengerjakan shalat yang lima waktu berpuasa di bulan ramadhan menjaga kemaluannya menjaga kehormatannya dan dia taat kepada suaminya niscaya ia akan masuk surga dari pintu surga mana saja yang dia kehendaki
2731972 sesungguhnya aku diperlihatkan neraka dan melihat kebanyakan penghuninya adalah wanita
2731973 sesungguhnya allah tidak akan melihat kepada seorang wanita yang tidak bersyukur kepada suaminya dan dia selalu menuntut tidak pernah merasa cukup
2731974 kaum laki laki itu adalah pemimpin bagi kaum wanita oleh karena allah telah melebihkan sebahagian mereka laki laki atas sebahagian yang lain wanita dan karena mereka laki laki telah menafkahkan sebagian dari harta mereka sebab itu maka wanita yang shalih ialah yang taat kepada allah lagi memelihara diri ketika suaminya tidak ada oleh karena allah telah memelihara mereka wanita wanita yang kamu khawatirkan nusyuznya maka nasihatilah mereka dan pisahkanlah mereka di tempat tidur mereka dan pukullah mereka kemudian jika mereka mentaatimu maka janganlah kamu mencari cari jalan untuk menyusahkannya sesungguhnya allah maha tinggi dan maha besar
2731975 kamu sekalian adalah pemimpin dan kamu sekalian bertanggungjawab atas orang yang dipimpinnya seorang amir raja adalah pemimpin laki laki pun pemimpin atas keluarganya dan perempuan juga pemimpin bagi rumah suaminya dan anak anaknya ingatlah bahwa kamu sekalian adalah pemimpin dan kamu sekalian akan dimintai pertanggungjawabannya atas kepemimpinannya
2731976 dan orang orang yang berdoa ya allah anugerahkanlah kepada kami isteri isteri kami keturunan keturunan kami sebagai penyenang hati kami dan jadikanlah kami imam bagi orang orang yang bertakwa
2731977 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2731978 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2731979 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2731980 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings

2731985 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2731986 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2731987 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2731988 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2731989 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2731990 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2731991 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2731992 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2731993 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2731994 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2731995 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2731996 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2731997 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2731998 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2731999 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2732000 what makes this arbitrage so remarkable is theyre buying the water and selling the water to the same entity using water that should never have been pumped in the first place
2732001 a return on the substantial investment of the district in the acquisition and development of the kern water bank
2732002 it really looks like that was a hit on the head
2732003 its not as if they the state department of water resources were selling article 21 in 2006 and buying it back the same year but you could say what difference does it make
2732004 people ask how we could spend billions of dollars and still have the fish crash this is the type of thing we were setting up
2732005 not just with loss of species but then bond funding and of course a water crisis
2732006 they got smarter about how to request this stuff rather than us changing the rules these guys are not stupid
2732007 there wasnt a great focus on how much it was because it was supposed to be infrequent
2732008 the reason for this concern is that water storage capacity within the kern water bank would be filled through additional water exports from the delta averaging approximately 90 000 acre feet per year

2732061 allah mengutuk orang orang yahudi dan nasrani yang menjadikan kubur nabi nabi mereka sebagai masjid atau tempat peribadatan dalam rangka memperingatkan untuk menjauhi apa yang mereka perbuat

2732114 this is a win win proposal for the state for lake compounce and for bristol and southington
2732115 if the bond commission approves the 3 3 million to pay for the relocation of a portion of mount vernon road in southington for utility upgrades and other related improvements it will lead to the investment of about 20 million by lake compounce for the expansion of the water park
2732116 this relatively modest investment in a public infrastructure improvement project will significantly benefit the towns the region and the state when completed the lake compounce expansion project will help bristol and southington by creating jobs and attracting more visitors to the amusement park many of whom will patronize local businesses it also will enhance the states rapidly growing tourist industry which is becoming a significant contributor to the states economy generating millions in revenues and hundreds of new jobs every year
2732117 although getting an item included on the bond commission agenda is a difficult and competitive process i believe state funding for this project is fully justified under whatever criteria are used to evaluate it it is important to the economic future of our towns and our state that is why i am aggressively pursuing the funding necessary to make it happen

2732145 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2732146 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2732147 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2732148 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2732149 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2732150 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2732151 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2732152 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2732169 white northerners had a rather complacent and self satisfied attitude that anti black prejudice and anti black violence in particular was largely a southern problem and one of the really shocking things about the well publicized springfield race riot and its association with abraham lincoln was that the north had a race problem
2732170 they clearly wanted to mete out lethal justice there on the spot
2732171 went from one end to the other looting homes damaging homes and ultimately setting them on fire by the time they were through theyd displaced at least 40 families
2732172 largely working class rioters were expressing resentment over visible black success and influence in the community
2732173 from the perspective of many springfield residents who were white justice was not done in the end
2732174 liberals in the north were so outraged by the symbolism of this violence occurring in lincolns hometown that they got together called a series of meetings and announced their intent on lincolns birthday in 1909 to form a new organization whose prime initial goal would be to fight anti black violence

2732488 rlig talt det er kanskje en grunn til at vi ikke har hatt kontakt siden vi var 11 r hadde vi f lt behovet for m tes s hadde vi vel gjort det for lenge siden
2732489 alts det at vi gikk p speideren sammen i 89 er vel kanskje ikke noen tungtveiende grunn for at vi plutselig skal gjenoppta kontakten n r vi n rmer oss 30 er det vel dessuten jukset du da vi hoppet strikk sammen og jeg har egentlig ikke likt deg siden
2732490 i wanted to go 4 03 i didnt know if i would
2732491 to be honest i didnt really feel that great and then going into the ready room i started getting chills up my body right then and there i was starting to get more and more excited i mean i was pretty emotional after that race and im pretty excited to have that first one under my belt
2732492 i wasnt comfortable after the first 200 after seeing everybody so close together
2732493 thats usually not how it as after the first 200 i think it made my breaststroke a lot stronger and at that point it was all adrenaline
2732494 i knew i had to go out fast in order to be in the race
2732495 if i was like a couple tenths slower on the backstroke i think i wouldve had a better shot i think that backstroke kind of took a lot out of me i did my best and i cant ask for anything else
2732496 i saw him after the race and he nodded and waved the american flag
2732497 its a pretty special feeling i waved and nodded my head back
2732498 i think were really happy with silver because i dont think we were even expecting to get that
2732499 i felt great i felt like i had more energy so im really psyched about my 50
2732500 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2732501 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2732502 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2732503 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2732504 she was mad she was angry i think furious would be a good way to describe it
2732505 i in 2006 told elizabeth about the mistake asked her for her forgiveness asked god for his forgiveness
2732506 they lived in a single house most of the time and split to two houses recently
2732507 the greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated
2732508 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2732509 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2732510 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2732511 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2732512 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2732513 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2732514 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2732515 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2732516 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2732517 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2732518 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2732519 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2732520 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2732521 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2732522 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2732523 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2732524 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2732525 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2732526 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2732527 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2732528 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2732529 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2732530 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2732531 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2732532 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2732533 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2732534 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2732535 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2732536 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2732537 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2732538 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2732539 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2732540 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2732541 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2732542 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields

2732552 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2732553 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2732554 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2732555 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2732556 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2732557 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2732558 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2732559 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2732560 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2732561 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2732562 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2732563 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2732564 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2732565 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2732566 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2732567 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2732568 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2732569 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2732570 who are open to doing something on the production side
2732571 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2732572 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2732573 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2732574 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2732575 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2732576 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2732577 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2732578 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2732579 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2732580 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2732581 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2732582 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2732583 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2732584 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2732585 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2732586 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2732587 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2732588 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2732589 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2732590 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2732591 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2732592 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2732593 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2732594 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2732595 i believe you should make money with your financial payday loan so you can work at home and be rich with this banking information that i will give you for more money
2732596 i believe you should make money with your financial payday loan so you can work at home and be rich with this banking information that i will give you for more money
2732597 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2732598 what is web logging and why everyone is talking about it
2732599 what is web logging and why everyone is talking about it
2732600 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2732601 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2732602 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2732603 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

2732659 sesungguhnya amal amal tergantung pada niat dan setiap orang akan mendapatkan sesuatu sesuai dengan niatnya

2732691 gee do you know why the bus is 15 minutes late
2732692 it was a good impression of world war three wasnt it i am a bit disappointed at the end but we are getting down to the part of the season where you take no prisoners with all the yellow flags that came out it bunched the field up and you got a real knockdown drag out in the end it was pretty much as i thought a fuel consumption race we had to make fuel the championship is tighter than ever which means everybody is going to be a little bit more tightly wound at the next race
2732693 from the beginning i was driving normally i was not pushing very hard the car was very very quick in the beginning there were two safety car procedures in a row where it kept the gap close so it was not an advantage for me to be quick i had some bad luck with traffic and lost two positions our strategy from that point on worked out perfectly we double stinted our michelin tires when i was in the car in the beginning the tires were perfect they dropped off a little bit at the end of the double stint we collected points and it is good there are still four races to go and a lot can happen
2732694 it was not the easiest race for anybody because of the circumstances there were lots of yellows which i was not expecting lots of confusion in the beginning with the time keeping the race was delayed 11 minutes for a timing and scoring malfunction i really had to push the car my first stint in the car was amazingly good at the end it was very difficult for me because there was no right mirror the glass was broken when farnbacher was overtaken for the lead and the number 45 car was losing huge amounts of oil my windscreen was completely covered in oil and with the sunset it was like a blind ride the final lap was just all over the place going towards turn five i had contact under braking and i went sideways going out of the corner i nearly lost the car and made contact as well it was really tough to get the car back on the track i am happy with third we lost a few points to the leaders but still everything is wide wide open we need to just look forward and keep pushing
2732695 alex did a really good job during his stint he was having trouble with the gearbox on the up shifts i felt it more on the downshifts when i got in the car we took a roll of the dice and kept him out during a caution and we had to fuel under green it was a good gamble we got up to third place alex did a great two hours i was working on my times and something fluid had to be down on the track i had a massive spin in turn 14 and went into the tire wall we fixed the damage and just got right back up on it the car had a push after that but it was kill or be killed out there it made for an interesting evening i am very proud of the 71 car for the podium and the whole team

2732700 my argument has always been that if youre going to have preschool its not inappropriate for the state to set some minimum standards

2732750 t he news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
2732751 the government of georgia has called for a ceasefire and for a resumption of direct talks on south ossetia with international mediators the u s should immediately work with the eu and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course that it has chosen
2732752 sen mccain is clearly willing to note who he thinks is the aggressor here
2732753 i dont think you can excuse defend explain or make allowance for russian behavior because of what is going on in georgia
2732754 mccain took an inflexible approach to addressing this issue by focusing heavily on one side without a pragmatic assessment of the situation its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
2732755 someone displaying at least three of seven distinguishing characteristics such as deceitfulness impulsivity and a lack of remorse such people often have a superficial charm which they exercise ruthlessly in order to get what they want
2732756 the actions of the georgian leadership in south ossetia are a crime and foremost they are a crime against their own people because a deadly blow has been delivered to the territorial integrity of georgia which brings massive damage to its national identity
2732757 its hard to imagine after all that had happened and after all that is still happening theyll be able to convince south ossetia to be part of georgia
2732758 in my opinion they are already elements of some kind of genocide of the ossetian people i think it would be correct if you instruct the military prosecutor to document all such incidents

2732904 does it happen all at once like being wound up
2732905 you become it takes a long time thats why it doesnt often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges or who have to be carefully kept generally by the time you are real most of your hair has been loved off and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby but these things dont matter at all because once you are real you cant be ugly except to people who dont understand

2732915 this was a project that could operate outside the regular business world

2732923 it was like you get married and then your girlfriend comes back
2732924 that intel viewed it quite as holistically as we did
2732925 but we came this close to not doing it i was advised by absolutely everybody to make it a profit making entity so we could make lots of money and then give it away but the non profit decision was important because it provided clarity of purpose first a head of state will talk to you because its about children and learning and not profit and secondly the best people will work for you for zero salary

2732933 that they waited until very late in the day to make it nearly impossible for olpc representatives on the east coast to get their side of the story in the first stories
2732934 if nicholas hadnt said what he said in january 05
2732935 this machine wouldnt be here and a lot of other technologies and discussions wouldnt be here he accelerated people getting access by probably years
2732936 they could keep on coming up with innovations and license out the technology take the money and fund olpc or they could open source the entire design of the computer

2733076 the fact that amazon has a well documented history of using partner data to their advantage in the third party selling world will make this argument very believable
2733077 i started selling my top seller widgetx on amazon merchants and then three weeks later amazon was competing with me
2733078 amazon went to my supplier and was able to get it cheaper and now im at a disadvantage

2733145 a number of the youth that we had asked for have been released and are now back home we are still taking stock of whether there are still more who are likely to be in police custody
2733146 our position remains that we really did not have any young men in our police cells and therefore we cannot be releasing any young men we do not have
2733147 we do not know exactly whether there was a general release because when we ask them the youth most of them do not exactly know whether they are expected to go back or not and they do not seem to be having any papers showing they have been released on bond or whichever arrangement

2733160 maybe ill just stay here and let them dig me a hole
2733161 this is the chancellor taking what five faculty members have labored over and come up with and throwing it to the side of the road
2733162 my job is not to rubber stamp what the committee brings forward my job is to assess reflect upon clarify and then go forward
2733163 if thats what keeps happening over and over again it isnt just me
2733164 the grievance process is going to have a winner and a loser
2733165 my job is to make sure that both parties get a fair and timely process
2733166 if the grievant doesnt get precisely what they want they feel they havent won
2733167 is about finding correcting and making sure it doesnt happen again
2733168 were trying to resolve these things and make people whole and repair whatever damage they feel has been done to them as a result of their experience with the university
2733169 sometimes there is no solution that the grievant will accept because the only thing the grievant will accept is total vindication and a return to the status he or she had before the incident occurred
2733170 personally i was disappointed and i felt very confident about the decision we arrived at as a committee
2733171 i know that there is discussion about changing the grievance procedure at the university
2733172 im not quite sure why we go through that much effort for something that seems to have been significantly re done by the administration
2733173 they dont sit through the hearings so were going through an amount of work and really were just making a recommendation to the chancellor who under the rules has no requirement to pay attention to those recommendations so whats the point
2733174 what ive seen at this university and others is that academic managers or the administration have little or no training or experience in managing people and that means that most of the problems that ive seen on this campus could have been easily prevented
2733175 now how he addressed the issue of the individual all i can do is say we made our ruling and that is up to him
2733176 the grievance process for faculty is a good process with two exceptions
2733177 one is that once it gets to the chancellor the final step the grievant has always been prejudiced by his decision
2733178 you dont make decisions based on those kinds of recommended time frames which is what the time frames are
2733179 we apologize every time we miss that 70 day deadline but i guarantee you that if its missed its missed for a reason
2733180 and we make every effort to notify the person that were going to be delayed
2733181 we informed the chancellor that he had to give it in a timely manner
2733182 i guess they are trying to make me tired make me give up
2733183 i see this as abuse of power corruption and its not coming from the people below its coming from the people above the lawyers the chancellor they treat us like the enemy
2733184 which university is going to accept me after i sued them
2733185 if you are the grievant even if you are completely right there are no consequences to the other side
2733186 they sue because the wrongs perpetrated on them by the process havent been corrected the people that do it do it because theyre outraged and because they have no other recourse
2733187 i would not suggest that the number of lawsuits filed is a reason to change the system if the system is working
2733188 the reason to change the system is to make it work better more efficiently with fewer resources and thats what were doing
2733189 the time and expenses have been significant to resolve them takes years
2733190 my office is very interested in making sure that there is a fair and effective grievance process
2733191 the question is has that bully violated one of the collected rules
2733192 i would love to have a mechanism to weed them out or correct their misbehavior but they are employees too they have rights and unless they violate a rule there is no action that i can take under the grievance process
2733193 chances are theyre going to be more able and willing to do that now that its not going to be such a time sucker
2733194 and especially for keeping parents apprised of whats going on in class every day
2733195 its always great when parents are full partners in what were doing in class a lot of parents mention to me that a child takes notes but they cant read them or the kid cant read them this will be a resource where they can see the notes and actually see what theyre supposed to be learning
2733196 i want parents to know what our library media center can do for them and their kids
2733197 this is really an exciting change for us especially with regard to improved communications and contact with parents and the community
2733198 we cut out looking at long range plans and are not going to talk at this point about whether we will or will not go to taxpayers in april
2733199 its too early it might be appropriate discussion a month from now but not without a superintendent sitting with us
2733200 our board as a whole has undergone more situations in one year than most entities
2733201 our experience as a board is very young our individual skills and how we process things are diverse
2733202 our district is an excellent one but weve had problems with communication both with our community and among ourselves
2733203 i dont think bringing us closer is quite what we need we dont need to all be in lockstep what is absolutely necessary is learning how to function effectively as a board
2733204 how our diversity can be used as strength to transform us into an effective and focused board a second outcome might be to gain more insight and suggestions on how to take the adversity the district is facing and turn it into productive forward action
2733205 we are a group of individuals with very different life experiences and i think we havent always seen eye to eye on how to do things
2733206 in that sense i do think some team building could be really useful but i am torn about whether this is the right time to do it i think partly rebuilding should include a superintendent too we might have to do it again when an interim is there
2733207 i think this is definitely an opportunity for us to be a board and to assert that role which i think the board hasnt been doing in the past
2733208 in 10 years hell in five years were all going to be doing this
2733209 i think by the time i was eight i had been as many places as years i was alive
2733210 im better than i was yesterday things are finally improving
2733211 i scraped a curb with my right front tire while turning a corner today it made such an awful sound that i immediately pulled over to take a look lo and behold the tire was flat the worse part of it was the bolts were rusted and merciless to get off but i finally got them off and the tire changed of course by that time i was late to my doctors appointment
2733212 today i got a flat tire on the way to my doctor theres just no hope of my affording a new tire now with money tight and all the other bills i cant pay

2733218 thats an old saying but our no 1 focus is our patients and trying to get them through the system and trying to get them to see a physician and get a disposition as quickly as possible
2733219 trying to get experienced nurses to come into the department and to have experience we certainly dont mind training our own staff but it does take longer
2733220 i never know when six people are going to come in and say i need to see a physician
2733221 at a time when other people are maybe downsizing or closing were going to be expanding
2733222 were handling the patients we have now very efficiently and this is just going to allow us to be more efficient
2733223 were a little bit behind some agencies that have had them
2733224 its one of those where we want our officers to effectively engage a threat if it presents itself
2733225 whether that threats aimed at the officer or aimed at the public we need to effectively deal with it and a patrol rifle would be one more tool to use
2733226 were looking at that but the main obstacle for us is expense
2733227 when news of it got to the camp it was too iffy to keep them there
2733228 they thought theyd probably be cut off from the roads and were talking about 40 diabetic children with parents living all over georgia as soon as they got word that bombs were starting to fall they got excited about getting the kids home

2733360 with costcos customer oriented decision more than one in three major grocery stores is now posting the government advice about mercury in fish
2733361 signs help shoppers in states like washington oregon and nevada to make informed choices about what they buy and feed their families but in other states shoppers are unlikely to learn about the healthiest fish unless companies like wal mart a amp p and publix get on board
2733362 posting a sign that tells consumers which fish they should avoid would let them know that other fish are ok to eat and allay any fears they may have
2733363 in fact some grocery stores that posted the fda advice had no negative effect on their seafood sales and one company even reported that seafood sales increased after posting the signs

2733378 hendrix was just a sweet guy to an extent he was murdered by the people around him because they didnt take care of him
2733379 it really wasnt until i was working with a little cassette player and my girlfriend was singing along with me while i was writing it that it struck me as a duet
2733380 at first i didnt appreciate her singing along but she was in the background there when i listened back to it i thought yes this absolutely should have a girl singing there it sounded great despite
2733381 when i finished the song i spoke to producer rick rubin about it and he immediately suggested natalie maines he said she was a great singer so we sent the record over to natalie
2733382 we both went into the studio and we both sang the song i really enjoyed the company out there and she is a wonderful singer she had a great attitude and it was fun

2733391 ive always wanted a family im not one of those people who says whats the point of marriage
2733392 id like to find someone you can be yourself around who makes you laugh who challenges you in a good way and where you just speak off each other
2733393 my parents have been married more than 25 years with all the glory and all the pain you can imagine but theyve stayed together i want a strong marriage like that
2733394 i went to the audition pathetically in a very low cut blouse with a push up bra
2733395 the honour is double or 10 times more when you hear the names of those who have gone before you and the things they have achieved
2733396 i dont drink which has been a big question mark for people its like you did a movie about wine and you dont drink at all
2733397 i play a bartender in the film and the bartender is not supposed to be imbibing while on duty so i keep it under control
2733398 i did drink wine at one time but as i started to get a little older at about 19 getting that headache in the morning or that puffiness is just not very user friendly for my job
2733399 everything became a little clearer sharper and better for me when

2733401 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2733402 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2733403 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2733404 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2733405 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2733406 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2733407 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2733408 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2733409 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2733410 they are so perfect together and so into talking to each other and just being together you dont even notice they dont kiss
2733411 they show that you can have a perfect relationship without being physical
2733412 bella and edward connect in ways other than with sex they connect spiritually
2733413 thats over 100 years and hes been waiting for bella the whole time hes never been with anyone else thats the most romantic thing ever
2733414 twilight shows girls that you can have the most intimate romantic relationship of your life without any sex
2733415 twilight helps girls realize they dont need to settle for anything less than what they really want
2733416 it teaches them to keep high standards that there are guys that will treat them with respect girls today need to learn this and they can learn it from this series
2733417 great here we go again reinforcing the notion that a great relationship doesnt involve sex
2733418 if more men spent time talking to their wives actually flirting with them again respecting them cherishing them they might get more sex after marriage
2733419 once spouses confront one another as equals only one can win the resulting battles
2733420 in which there is only room for one full person
2733421 as a hierarchy in which someone usually the husband has to be the boss

2733423 we look forward to the day when people will accept our products as the 25 year overnight success that they are rather than looking down their noses while passing judgment on that which they do not understand until that time we are content at being the best kept secret in the entire smoking industry and a favorite to the underground elite
2733424 we must know that you will follow your instructions no matter what the circumstances inside this room you will find your wife sitting in a chair you have to kill her
2733425 you cant be serious i could never shoot my wife
2733426 you dont have what it takes take your wife and go home
2733427 we expect nimetz to make a better proposal than his previous one
2733428 we are appealing to our southern neighbour to enable the olympics spirit and the spirit of sports competition to find their real place at the olympic games in beijing
2733429 the bilateral issues that we have with our southern neighbour should be settled via the well known forums
2733430 i was just out having a few drinks a dance and a good laugh with the girls from work the last thing i thought was that i would meet my future husband in a place that was renowned for being a cattle market where young lads picked up girls for one night stands and vice versa
2733431 they may look good but wait until they open their mouths you cant have a decent conversation with them and besides youre not afraid to let your hair down and have a good time and that makes you far more beautiful than any eighteen year old youd be lucky if those girls let you near them in case you messed up their makeup or hair and what happens when they get older and dont have the personality to replace the looks
2733432 my friend and i who are in the air force had just returned from a posting in cyprus and we had a couple of weeks break before our next mission

2733443 the degree to which commercial entities will go to disrupt a humanitarian project
2733444 this was a project that could operate outside the regular business world
2733445 and thats not an unreasonable expectation but it is in some ways threatening to businesses and when you threaten businesses especially very large ones they are going to react in ways that hurt you
2733446 he said that sort of thing privately to people i knew
2733447 there was a fair amount of that i was annoyed enough to say so and he apologised for it a lot of good that did
2733448 was not the how of computing but the why and the primary answer was learning
2733449 this was a very remote village no electricity no telephone no tv but the wi fi was so well done that when i asked myself if you look at the constituent parts they were all replicable and in most cases the prices would scale down
2733450 its crippling because like an suv most of the power in that machine is being used to drive the machine not you or i
2733451 its not working as well as it should because not enough people are connected at the moment
2733452 it was like you get married and then your girlfriend comes back
2733453 that intel viewed it quite as holistically as we did
2733454 but we came this close to not doing it i was advised by absolutely everybody to make it a profit making entity so we could make lots of money and then give it away but the non profit decision was important because it provided clarity of purpose first a head of state will talk to you because its about children and learning and not profit and secondly the best people will work for you for zero salary
2733455 he would go from prime minister meeting to president of country meeting and that was his sales model
2733456 and it didnt work absolutely not as we have learnt in the business world just because you have a handshake from the president or the prime minister it doesnt mean you have an order
2733457 it created enough hype and pictures of nicholas shaking hands with heads of state that back in taiwan where 250 engineers were working on it people felt part of something
2733458 it can take years to get a ui right so starting from scratch for me was a question
2733459 i left because the future of sugar was going to be bigger and bolder than just being confined to the olpc laptop
2733460 its hard to pinpoint a start date with the nature of ethnographic research in which ethnographers collect data over a long period of time
2733461 which is chartered to extend pc access to the worlds next billion users
2733462 that they waited until very late in the day to make it nearly impossible for olpc representatives on the east coast to get their side of the story in the first stories
2733463 if nicholas hadnt said what he said in january 05
2733464 this machine wouldnt be here and a lot of other technologies and discussions wouldnt be here he accelerated people getting access by probably years
2733465 they could keep on coming up with innovations and license out the technology take the money and fund olpc or they could open source the entire design of the computer
2733466 preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all and doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables but watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the work of an evangelist make full proof of thy ministry
2733467 you must preach the truth as you see it you must be tough on evil but kind and loving you must make certain that people know that you are not talking about anyone in particular you are only against evil in the abstract the evil you speak of must be popular incorrect wickedness like racism pollution and injustice and definitely not include sodomy slander malice filthy talking fornication and unbelief social sins are very much in and you may preach all you want about those but stay away from personal wickedness for that makes people uncomfortable you must hold your finger to the wind because truth changes and mores change and you dont want to be talking about yesterdays truth yesterdays evils and yesterdays virtues you must be cutting edge most of all you must not speak of repentance or hell or the wrath of god for these things make people feel bad there is good is all of us and your duty is to connect with the good
2733468 thus saith the lord of hosts hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you they make you vain they speak a vision of their own heart and not out of the mouth of the lord they say still unto them that despise me the lord hath said ye shall have peace and they say unto every one that after the imagination of his own heart no evil shall come upon you

2733479 i think bill clinton is hurting ill be honest with you said durbin pointing to the tough race that the former presidents wife lost for the democratic presidential nomination
2733480 but trust me when people judge what bill clinton did in moving our economy forward hes going to do quite well and he will campaign for obama
2733481 there is weakness when it comes to both political parties said durbin noting that edwards has announced through a spokesman that he will not be attending the party convention in denver this month
2733482 the amount of money they are taking in profits at the expense of families and farmers and the business of our overall economy the profit taking that they are experiencing is at the expense of this economy

2733557 we believe our agreement with bupa presents an opportunity for real competition in the irish health insurance market in all of our businesses we operate in an open and competitive environment and we trust that the report of the review group established by the minister for health mary harney td and other initiatives will lead to a more open and competitive landscape in this market
2733558 our announcement of a price freeze in 2007 demonstrates our commitment to delivering value to health consumers in the irish market over the longer term bupa ireland are a fine organisation whove brought innovation and choice to irish consumers and we look forward to working with the team in fermoy to grow the business
2733559 our priority since the announcement that we were withdrawing from the market has been to secure the best alternative arrangement for our staff and customers we tried until as recently as last week to achieve a compromise with government that would have allowed us to stay this was not possible we believe the transfer of the business to the quinn group to be the next best alternative we are proud to have brought competition to the irish healthcare market we regret being forced out because of the scale of the risk equalisation charges that were accruing but we are very pleased that this agreement with the quinn group will preserve competition choice and continue the range of benefits available to bupa ireland members
2733560 the agreement with the quinn group is good news for our members the group is financially very strong and has a record of innovation in customer service and the capacity to compete strongly in the consumers interest the transfer arrangements will take a short while in the meantime it will be business as usual in fermoy we will be available to help with customer enquiries renewals and transfers

2733614 i knew what i was told about the war was totally false
2733615 in 1968 i came back and dan was across the hall at rand
2733616 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore
2733617 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me
2733618 dad you gave me the gift of being able to share my love and affection with my family
2733619 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2733620 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2733621 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2733622 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2733623 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2733624 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2733625 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2733626 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2733627 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2733628 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2733629 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2733630 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2733631 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2733632 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2733633 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2733634 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2733635 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2733636 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2733637 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2733638 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2733639 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2733640 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2733641 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2733642 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2733643 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2733644 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2733645 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2733646 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2733647 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2733648 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2733649 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2733650 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2733651 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2733652 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2733653 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2733654 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2733655 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2733656 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2733657 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2733658 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2733659 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2733660 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2733661 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2733662 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2733663 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2733664 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2733665 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2733666 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2733667 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2733668 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2733669 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2733670 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2733671 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2733672 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2733673 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2733674 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2733675 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2733676 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2733677 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2733678 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2733679 things are so bad at six flags its now called three flags
2733680 the only thing rising at six flags is the rollercoaster
2733681 a contest offered a vacation prize first prize a day at six flags second prize two days at six flags

2733696 we have carried messages to all the countries we visited that iraq is in need of reconstruction in all fields including railways oil electricity bridges and housing
2733697 we communicated that message beforehand to the russians through u s secretary of state condoleezza rice
2733698 we must check all that we dont trust the georgian side
2733699 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2733700 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2733701 the deployment is quite natural we dont want a repeat of what happened in south ossetia
2733702 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2733703 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2733704 complete genocide putin also said georgia had effectively lost the right to rule the breakaway province an indication moscow could be preparing to fulfill south ossetians wish to be absorbed into russia

2733716 you may hear many dates but i caution you not to take any of these dates until you get the final document
2733717 postponing the election law will complicate the situation in kirkuk and lead to a struggle between the factions and eventually a civil war may erupt
2733718 the parliament and the government has to work seriously to resolve the situation
2733719 we want to solve the problem not ignite the problem and i came to kirkuk with a message from the kurdish people which is the message of brotherhood love and invitation for understanding
2733720 if there is a shortcoming in the kurdish performance we are ready to rectify it
2733721 kurds are fed up with the crooked policy of malikis government it is time to bring kirkuk back to its origin kurdistan
2733722 malikis government has to prove its influence by ensuring all iraqi factions are represented in the provincial council and not let some parties control the city
2733723 we have fears about foreign agendas by parties inside and outside kirkuk why have all the parties positions unified against the kurds
2733724 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2733725 the talks are still ongoing theres been a great deal of progress the deal is very close it is about to be closed
2733726 our negotiators have really found compromises on all these issues
2733727 you may hear many dates but i caution you not to take any of these dates until you get the final document
2733728 when writing the business plan they decided to stay away from the notion of a personal computer since the bankers they were talking to had no idea what a computer was or wasnt
2733729 so for the first product they needed something they could get off the ground with existing technology but the notion from the get go was to build a personal computer firm
2733730 noyce said it was an intriguing idea and that intel could do it but it would be a dumb move
2733731 he said that if you have a computer chip you can only sell one chip per computer while with memory you can sell hundreds of chips per computer
2733732 could go to 16 000 bytes of memory and if you were going to spend that much on memory then there was no sense in saving maybe 50 on the processor by moving it out of ttl
2733733 these were industrial strength products they were trying to downsize mainframe business applications
2733734 roche said the idea that you can print a computer on a chip is astounding a profound innovation and we should own the intellectual property
2733735 they said why spend 50 000 for a product we cant use it was one of the worst business decisions in history
2733736 i can look at a current pc and still see the image of that original machine buried down in there with a lot of other stuff especially more registers
2733737 remember i told you i would do something for you you are safe

2733739 but its the common lot this morning mrs hudson has been knocked up she retorted upon me and i on you
2733740 no a client it seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement who insists upon seeing me she is waiting now in the sitting room now when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning and knock sleepy people up out of their beds i presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate should it prove to be an interesting case you would i am sure wish to follow it from the outset i thought at any rate that i should call you and give you the chance
2733741 my dear fellow i would not miss it for anything
2733742 my name is sherlock holmes this is my intimate friend and associate dr watson before whom you can speak as freely as before myself ha i am glad to see that mrs hudson has had the good sense to light the fire pray draw up to it and i shall order you a cup of hot coffee for i observe that you are shivering
2733743 we shall soon set matters right i have no doubt you have come in by train this morning i see
2733744 no but i observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove you must have started early and yet you had a good drive in a dog cart along heavy roads before you reached the station
2733745 the left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places the marks are perfectly fresh there is no vehicle save a dog cart which throws up mud in that way and then only when you sit on the left hand side of the driver
2733746 i started from home before six reached leatherhead at twenty past and came in by the first train to waterloo sir i can stand this strain no longer i shall go mad if it continues i have no one to turn to none save only one who cares for me and he poor fellow can be of little aid i have heard of you mr holmes i have heard of you from mrs farintosh whom you helped in the hour of her sore need it was from her that i had your address oh sir do you not think that you could help me too and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me at present it is out of my power to reward you for your services but in a month or six weeks i shall be married with the control of my own income and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful
2733747 ah yes i recall the case it was concerned with an opal tiara i think it was before your time watson i can only say madam that i shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as i did to that of your friend as to reward my profession is its own reward but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses i may be put to at the time which suits you best and now i beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter
2733748 the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points which might seem trivial to another that even he to whom of all others i have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that i tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman he does not say so but i can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes but i have heard mr holmes that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart you may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me
2733749 my name is helen stoner and i am living with my stepfather who is the last survivor of one of the oldest saxon families in england the roylotts of stoke moran on the western border of surrey
2733750 the family was at one time among the richest in england and the estates extended over the borders into berkshire in the north and hampshire in the west
2733751 but a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time
2733752 last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream and it was only by paying over all the money which i could gather together that i was able to avert another public exposure
2733753 you can imagine from what i say that my poor sister julia and i had no great pleasure in our lives no servant would stay with us and for a long time we did all the work of the house she was but thirty at the time of her death and yet her hair had already begun to whiten even as mine has
2733754 she died just two years ago and it is of her death that i wish to speak to you you can understand that living the life which i have described we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position we had however an aunt my mothers maiden sister miss honoria westphail who lives near harrow and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this ladys house julia went there at christmas two years ago and met there a half pay major of marines to whom she became engaged my stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion
2733755 it is easy for me to be so for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory the manor house is as i have already said very old and only one wing is now inhabited the bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor the sitting rooms being in the central block of the buildings of these bedrooms the first is dr roylotts the second my sisters and the third my own there is no communication between them but they all open out into the same corridor do i make myself plain
2733756 the windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn
2733757 tell me helen said she have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night
2733758 i suppose that you could not possibly whistle yourself in your sleep
2733759 because during the last few nights i have always about three in the morning heard a low clear whistle
2733760 no i have not it must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation
2733761 very likely and yet if it were on the lawn i wonder that you did not hear it also
2733762 well it is of no great consequence at any rate she smiled back at me closed my door and a few moments later i heard her key turn in the lock
2733763 was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night
2733764 i think that i mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon we had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked
2733765 i could not sleep that night a vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me my sister and i you will recollect were twins and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied it was a wild night the wind was howling outside and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows suddenly amid all the hubbub of the gale there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman i knew that it was my sisters voice i sprang from my bed wrapped a shawl round me and rushed into the corridor as i opened my door i seemed to hear a low whistle such as my sister described and a few moments later a clanging sound as if a mass of metal had fallen as i ran down the passage my sisters door was unlocked and revolved slowly upon its hinges i stared at it horror stricken not knowing what was about to issue from it by the light of the corridor lamp i saw my sister appear at the opening her face blanched with terror her hands groping for help her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard i ran to her and threw my arms round her but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground she writhed as one who is in terrible pain and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed at first i thought that she had not recognised me but as i bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which i shall never forget oh my god helen it was the band the speckled band there was something else which she would fain have said and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctors room but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words i rushed out calling loudly for my stepfather and i met him hastening from his room in his dressing gown when he reached my sisters side she was unconscious and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village all efforts were in vain for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister
2733766 are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound could you swear to it
2733767 that was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry it is my strong impression that i heard it and yet among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house i may possibly have been deceived
2733768 no she was in her night dress in her right hand was found the charred stump of a match and in her left a match box
2733769 showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place that is important and what conclusions did the coroner come to
2733770 he investigated the case with great care for dr roylotts conduct had long been notorious in the county but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death my evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side and the windows were blocked by old fashioned shutters with broad iron bars which were secured every night the walls were carefully sounded and were shown to be quite solid all round and the flooring was also thoroughly examined with the same result the chimney is wide but is barred up by four large staples it is certain therefore that my sister was quite alone when she met her end besides there were no marks of any violence upon her
2733771 what do you think that this unfortunate lady died of then
2733772 it is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock though what it was that frightened her i cannot imagine
2733773 ah and what did you gather from this allusion to a band a speckled band
2733774 sometimes i have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation i do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used
2733775 two years have passed since then and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever a month ago however a dear friend whom i have known for many years has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage his name is armitage percy armitage the second son of mr armitage of crane water near reading my stepfather has offered no opposition to the match and we are to be married in the course of the spring two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building and my bedroom wall has been pierced so that i have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept imagine then my thrill of terror when last night as i lay awake thinking over her terrible fate i suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death i sprang up and lit the lamp but nothing was to be seen in the room i was too shaken to go to bed again however so i dressed and as soon as it was daylight i slipped down got a dog cart at the crown inn which is opposite and drove to leatherhead from whence i have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice
2733776 miss roylott you have not you are screening your stepfather
2733777 there are a thousand details which i should desire to know before i decide upon our course of action yet we have not a moment to lose if we were to come to stoke moran to day would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather
2733778 as it happens he spoke of coming into town to day upon some most important business it is probable that he will be away all day and that there would be nothing to disturb you we have a housekeeper now but she is old and foolish and i could easily get her out of the way
2733779 then we shall both come what are you going to do yourself
2733780 i have one or two things which i would wish to do now that i am in town but i shall return by the twelve oclock train so as to be there in time for your coming
2733781 and you may expect us early in the afternoon i have myself some small business matters to attend to will you not wait and breakfast
2733782 no i must go my heart is lightened already since i have confided my trouble to you i shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon
2733783 it seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business
2733784 yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound and that the door window and chimney are impassable then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end
2733785 what becomes then of these nocturnal whistles and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman
2733786 when you combine the ideas of whistles at night the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughters marriage the dying allusion to a band and finally the fact that miss helen stoner heard a metallic clang which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place i think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines
2733787 and so do i it is precisely for that reason that we are going to stoke moran this day i want to see whether the objections are fatal or if they may be explained away but what in the name of the devil
2733788 my name sir but you have the advantage of me
2733789 i will do nothing of the kind my stepdaughter has been here i have traced her what has she been saying to you
2733790 it is a little cold for the time of the year
2733791 i know you you scoundrel i have heard of you before you are holmes the meddler
2733792 when you go out close the door for there is a decided draught
2733793 i will go when i have said my say dont you dare to meddle with my affairs i know that miss stoner has been here i traced her i am a dangerous man to fall foul of see here
2733794 i am not quite so bulky but if he had remained i might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own
2733795 fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force this incident gives zest to our investigation however and i only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her and now watson we shall order breakfast and afterwards i shall walk down to doctors commons where i hope to get some data which may help us in this matter
2733796 to determine its exact meaning i have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned the total income which at the time of the wifes death was little short of 1100 is now through the fall in agricultural prices not more than 750 each daughter can claim an income of 250 in case of marriage it is evident therefore that if both girls had married this beauty would have had a mere pittance while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent my mornings work has not been wasted since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort and now watson this is too serious for dawdling especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs so if you are ready we shall call a cab and drive to waterloo i should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket an eleys no 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots that and a tooth brush are i think all that we need
2733797 yes sir that be the house of dr grimesby roylott
2733798 but if you want to get to the house youll find it shorter to get over this stile and so by the foot path over the fields there it is where the lady is walking
2733799 yes i think we had better do as you suggest
2733800 that this fellow should think we had come here as architects or on some definite business it may stop his gossip good afternoon miss stoner you see that we have been as good as our word
2733801 all has turned out splendidly dr roylott has gone to town and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening
2733802 we have had the pleasure of making the doctors acquaintance
2733803 he is so cunning that i never know when i am safe from him what will he say when he returns
2733804 he must guard himself for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track you must lock yourself up from him to night if he is violent we shall take you away to your aunts at harrow now we must make the best use of our time so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine
2733805 this i take it belongs to the room in which you used to sleep the centre one to your sisters and the one next to the main building to dr roylotts chamber
2733806 exactly so but i am now sleeping in the middle one
2733807 pending the alterations as i understand by the way there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall
2733808 there were none i believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room
2733809 ah that is suggestive now on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open there are windows in it of course
2733810 yes but very small ones too narrow for anyone to pass through
2733811 as you both locked your doors at night your rooms were unapproachable from that side now would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters
2733812 my theory certainly presents some difficulties no one could pass these shutters if they were bolted well we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter
2733813 yes it was only put there a couple of years ago
2733814 no i never heard of her using it we used always to get what we wanted for ourselves
2733815 indeed it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell pull there you will excuse me for a few minutes while i satisfy myself as to this floor
2733816 no it is not even attached to a wire this is very interesting you can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is
2733817 there are one or two very singular points about this room for example what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room when with the same trouble he might have communicated with the outside air
2733818 yes there were several little changes carried out about that time
2733819 they seem to have been of a most interesting character dummy bell ropes and ventilators which do not ventilate with your permission miss stoner we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment
2733820 only once some years ago i remember that it was full of papers
2733821 no we dont keep a cat but there is a cheetah and a baboon
2733822 ah yes of course well a cheetah is just a big cat and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants i daresay there is one point which i should wish to determine
2733823 its a common enough lash but i dont know why it should be tied
2733824 that is not quite so common is it ah me its a wicked world and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all i think that i have seen enough now miss stoner and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn
2733825 that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect
2733826 the matter is too serious for any hesitation your life may depend upon your compliance
2733827 in the first place both my friend and i must spend the night in your room
2733828 yes it must be so let me explain i believe that that is the village inn over there
2733829 you must confine yourself to your room on pretence of a headache when your stepfather comes back then when you hear him retire for the night you must open the shutters of your window undo the hasp put your lamp there as a signal to us and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy i have no doubt that in spite of the repairs you could manage there for one night
2733830 we shall spend the night in your room and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you
2733831 i believe mr holmes that you have already made up your mind
2733832 then for pitys sake tell me what was the cause of my sisters death
2733833 i should prefer to have clearer proofs before i speak
2733834 you can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct and if she died from some sudden fright
2733835 no i do not think so i think that there was probably some more tangible cause and now miss stoner we must leave you for if dr roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain good bye and be brave for if you will do what i have told you you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you
2733836 i have really some scruples as to taking you to night there is a distinct element of danger
2733837 you speak of danger you have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me
2733838 no but i fancy that i may have deduced a little more i imagine that you saw all that i did
2733839 i saw nothing remarkable save the bell rope and what purpose that could answer i confess is more than i can imagine
2733840 yes but i do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms it was so small that a rat could hardly pass through
2733841 i knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to stoke moran
2733842 oh yes i did you remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell dr roylotts cigar now of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms it could only be a small one or it would have been remarked upon at the coroners inquiry i deduced a ventilator
2733843 well there is at least a curious coincidence of dates a ventilator is made a cord is hung and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies does not that strike you
2733844 it was clamped to the floor did you ever see a bed fastened like that before
2733845 the lady could not move her bed it must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope or so we may call it since it was clearly never meant for a bell pull
2733846 i seem to see dimly what you are hinting at we are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime
2733847 subtle enough and horrible enough when a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals he has nerve and he has knowledge palmer and pritchard were among the heads of their profession this man strikes even deeper but i think watson that we shall be able to strike deeper still but we shall have horrors enough before the night is over for goodness sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful
2733848 we must sit without light he would see it through the ventilator
2733849 do not go asleep your very life may depend upon it have your pistol ready in case we should need it i will sit on the side of the bed and you in that chair
2733850 and perhaps after all it is for the best take your pistol and we will enter dr roylotts room
2733851 the deadliest snake in india he has died within ten seconds of being bitten violence does in truth recoil upon the violent and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another let us thrust this creature back into its den and we can then remove miss stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened
2733852 come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows my dear watson how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data
2733853 i had come to these conclusions before ever i had entered his room an inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator the sight of the safe the saucer of milk and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained the metallic clang heard by miss stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant having once made up my mind you know the steps which i took in order to put the matter to the proof i heard the creature hiss as i have no doubt that you did also and i instantly lit the light and attacked it
2733854 and also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper so that it flew upon the first person it saw in this way i am no doubt indirectly responsible for dr grimesby roylotts death and i cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience
2733855 were being driven away the place was in flames and we couldnt stay
2733856 this reminds me all too much of other recent conflicts that have torn our continent apart particularly in the balkans
2733857 we have left practically all of south ossetia as an expression of goodwill and our willingness to stop military confrontation
2733858 we have asked united states secretary of state condoleezza rice to mediate with the russians to transmit them our message
2733859 how much does it pain my heart and my soul to announce to the palestinian people the arab and islamic world and to everyone who loves peace and freedom the passing of the star of palestine
2733860 the absence of our great poet mahmud darwish the love of palestine and the pioneer of the modern palestinian cultural project will leave a great void in our cultural political and national life
2733861 darwish is the essential breath of the palestinian people the eloquent witness of exile and belonging
2733862 before anything mahmud darwish was a great poet who possessed real poetic power
2733863 he quickly became the national palestinian poet the poet of the exile and of the refugees
2733864 deprives the palestinians and all the arabs of one of their most noted representatives for contemporary poetry and culture
2733865 with his poetry darwish transcended all the frontiers and broke the chains of narrow patriotism in order to become the voice of palestine
2733866 determination obsession hope the fiery emotions illuminate the two swords
2733867 we are absolutely devastated by what has occurred for their loss and for everything they are going through
2733868 we are a family and well get through this together as a family
2733869 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot
2733870 beijing is a safe city but unfortunately we are not immune to violent acts
2733871 tang has no criminal record his neighbors said they hadnt seen any abnormal behavior from him before he left hangzhou
2733872 calls on all political and social actors to ensure a peaceful climate throughout the electoral process and its aftermath
2733873 may not wear a hat or remain by the clerks desk during the call of the roll or the counting of ballots
2733874 na vojnu postrojbu koju je predvodio general hruljev otvorena je topni ka paljba s gruzijske strane zapovjednik armije je zadobio ozljede od krhotine granate
2733875 ovo je jedan od najte ih trenutaka u mojoj karijeri ma tala sam o nastupu na oi i nadala sam se kako bi u pekingu mogla osvojiti medalju
2733876 both asia and the west have elite culture but in china confucian forms dominate
2733877 this panda is a flunky who haggles for his own selfish ends
2733878 given the political overlay it becomes very difficult in china to make movies
2733879 if you start off with a fat lazy panda a national symbol someone is bound to come along and say we cant give an image to the world that china is fat and lazy
2733880 if kung fu panda were produced in china audiences would be sniping at the director for not setting a good example
2733881 in cartoon school we learned to combine instruction and entertainment
2733882 but we had a certain tradition before china opened up and its hard to get away from that overnight
2733883 you couldnt have violence or blood which meant no confrontation or drama it was impossible to create anything in the end i didnt want to waste two years of my life on this propaganda so i quit
2733884 dont plan on going upstairs tonight after shes in bed
2733885 im not quite ready i need to finish this close the door stand in the corner
2733886 go ahead and go in the bathroom be sure to brush your teeth take out your contacts while youre there
2733887 its only 9 30 im not ready for bed and neither are you
2733888 a half hour till bedtime at least maybe longer and no you may not cum tonight you can however lie here and think and fantasize about coming hard with my hands on your breasts about having your ass fucked those sorts of things
2733889 if you need something ill be across the hall and will hear you if you call out and ill come check on you we wouldnt want those batteries to run down would we
2733890 if you continue to be a good girl you might get an orgasm at bedtime might i said might have one orgasm

2733901 she is almost 30 that is very old especially in the countryside
2733902 my biggest wish is that she can marry her friends kids are already grown up and she hasnt even started
2733903 we are farmers for generations i hoped she could do something different

2733909 yanqing told us women weightlifters have difficulties finding a date or a good job people all thought they were fat and bad looking yanqing is still slim and looks nice but we wanted her to start up a normal life
2733910 her future would be uncertain as we have walked 80 kilometers we should finish the remaining 20 kilometers
2733911 its very difficult to find another person with the strong mind the experience the control of skills and the stability in performance like her

2733923 the deployment is quite natural we dont want a repeat of what happened in south ossetia
2733924 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2733925 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2733926 complete genocide putin also said georgia had effectively lost the right to rule the breakaway province an indication moscow could be preparing to fulfill south ossetians wish to be absorbed into russia

2733928 russian officials said they werent targeting civilians but russias foreign minister sergey lavrov said that

2733946 strange as it may seem it is still true that those who fail to understand other churches than their own are not the people who care intensely about theology but the theological dilettantes eclectics and historians of all sorts while those very men who have found themselves forced to confront a clear thoroughgoing logical sic et non find themselves allied to each other inspite of all contradictions by an underlying fellowship and understanding even in the cause which they handle so differently and approach from such painfully different angles but the cause it may be is nothing less than jesus christ and the unity of the church

2733985 todays message is simple all the gobs have to do is wait long enough and the voters of this county will forget whatever transgressions may have angered them in the past
2733986 to shield itself from public accountability the white house crafted rules which ignored centuries of legal precedent and tossed aside even the barest semblance of justice in favor of a system automatically tilted toward the prosecution

2734137 the battle for the mind of north america will be fought int he video arena the video drome the tv screen is the retina of the minds eye therefor the tv screen is part of the physical structure of the brain therefor whatever appears on tv screen emerges as raw experience for those who watch it therefor tv is reality and reality is less than tv
2734138 im so glad you came to me ive been through it all myself you see
2734139 a new organ a new part of the brain i think that massive doses of videodromes signal will ultimately create a new outgrowth of the human brain which will produce and control hallucination to the point that it will change human reality after all there is nothing real outside our perception of reality is there huhuhuh you can see that cant you

2734168 does anyone believe that it is possible to win the nomination without over these next two months raising all these issues on him wont a single tape of the reverend jeremiah wright going off on america with obama sitting there be a game ender
2734169 clinton began to grow angry according to a participants notes
2734170 this has been a very instructive call talking to myself she snapped and hung up
2734171 the backstabbing and conflicting strategies that produced an epic meltdown
2734172 i cannot imagine american electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
2734173 the anger and toxic obsessions overwhelmed even the most reserved beltway wise men
2734174 h er advisers couldnt execute strategy they routinely attacked and undermined each other and clinton never forced a resolution s he never behaved like a chief executive and her own staff proved to be her achilles heel
2734175 what is clear from the internal documents is that clintons loss derived not from any specific decision she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make
2734176 i dont mean to be an asshole but changes to important statements and other critical campaign communications simply have to go through howard
2734177 howard is the person who is ultimately responsibility for making sure that we deliver our messages the right way and i hope everyone will support and respect him in that role
2734178 this circular firing squad that is occurring is unattractive unprofessional unconscionable and unacceptable after this campaign is over there will be plenty of time to access blame or claim credit
2734179 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
2734180 save it for 2050 every speech should contain the line you were born in the middle of america american to the middle class in the middle of the last century
2734181 lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt make this a new american century the american strategic energy fund lets use our logo to make some flags we can give out lets add flag symbols to the backgrounds
2734182 assuming after iowa and new hampshire the presidential nominating contest narrows to two competitive candidates who remain locked in a highly contested election through 5 february the focus of the campaign will shift to the delegate count
2734183 when the house is on fire its better to have a psychotic fireman than no fireman at all
2734184 the internal discord over whether to attack obama led some of her own staff to spin reporters to try to downplay the significance of her criticisms the result for clinton was the worst of both worlds the conflicting message exacerbated her reputation for negativity without affording her whatever benefits a sustained attack might have yielded
2734185 in the days leading up to ohio and texas the campaign kept arguing over whether to air the 3 a
2734186 two security researchers have developed a new technique that essentially bypasses all of the memory protection safeguards in the windows vista operating system

2734188 we did everything we could but we ran out of time i will continue to have treatment from an osteopath and hopefully i will be ready for the u s open
2734189 in my opinion there are maybe four or five people in the whole country who might be able to make this stuff and im one of them
2734190 and even with a good lab and staff to help run it it might take me a year to come up with a product as good
2734191 the f b i is committed to protecting the news media consistent with the first amendment and department of justice policies and we very much regret that this situation occurred
2734192 i want to find more about what this is about
2734193 we will be asking our general counsel to advise us on what more we should be doing about this
2734194 i told the director that it was gracious of him to apologize of course wed still like to know more about how this happened and how the bureau is securing against similar violations in the future

2734196 immediate and unconditional ceasefire and withdrawal of all military forces to their positions before the start of fighting

2734198 it is my fervent hope that all military actions cease immediately
2734199 also in the name of a shared christian heritage refrain from more clashes and from violent retaliation that can degenerate in a wider conflict
2734200 together with our orthodox brethren we pray intensely for these intentions which we trustingly deliver to the intercession of the holiest virgin mary mother of god and all christians

2734202 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2734203 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2734204 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2734205 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2734206 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2734213 while we are looking at god we do not see ourselves blessed riddance the man who has struggled to purify himself and has had nothing but repeated failures will experience real relief when he stops tinkering with his soul and looks away to the perfect one while he looks at christ the very thing he has so long been trying to do will be getting done within him
2734214 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2734215 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2734216 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2734237 its a very small population base and will be a huge amount of wealth they are just taking the requisite amount of time in a democratic way to see how they will handle it
2734238 over the past six decades asia has gone from an area mired in poverty and recovering from world war to a thriving and dynamic region
2734239 our interests and ideals alike require stronger engagement in asia than ever before
2734240 by maintaining a stabilising military presence we helped to free emerging nations from concerns about security
2734241 overall america has improved our relationships with all of asias major powers at the same time
2734242 by pursuing strong diplomatic engagement we helped once hostile nations resolve their differences in peace and by opening our markets to asian exports we helped powerful economies to take shape
2734243 all these steps were designed to reassure our allies that america will stand firmly beside them in any test we face
2734244 every nation in this region has a stake in ensuring that asia continues to grow in liberty prosperity and hope
2734245 voices of economic isolationism do not represent the interests of the american people

2734249 the chinese can expect that any future american president will also make it an important aspect
2734250 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot
2734251 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations

2734255 the majority race is not as good at identifying minorities as it is its own race this is hard wired in some way that we dont completely understand but the phenomenon should be presented to the jury
2734256 this is not an appropriate area for judges to go into
2734257 yes eyewitness id across races has its issues but is there a rampant problem to the degree that we need to get judges to start telling juries this is the law no
2734258 its a memoir of our journey through the system also of forgiveness and redemption
2734259 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2734260 the talks are still ongoing theres been a great deal of progress the deal is very close it is about to be closed

2734279 my own opinion is that when the whole state is on the right course it is a better thing for each separate individual than when private interests are satisfied but the state as a whole is going downhill however well off a man may be in his private life he will still be involved in the general ruin if his country is destroyed whereas so long as the state itself is secure individuals have a much greater chance of recovering from their private misfortunes
2734280 unless youre working in a sweatshop and youre getting paid 12 cents an hour you can save
2734281 we think we dont have enough money because were always the last ones in line
2734282 the money in you discover your financial personality and live the millionaires life
2734283 people say money just goes through my fingers or i dont know what happened to it
2734284 pay attention and bring it from the unconscious to the conscious
2734285 the first check you write every month should be to you
2734286 that should go to your savings start with 5 hopefully you can get to 10 when you get a raise put half of your raise in savings
2734287 you get older and the more bad habits you have the harder it is to break them
2734288 its little by little that youre able to accumulate vast amounts of money
2734289 for example take someone who is 25 years old who just sets aside a dollar a day in their retirement account if they earn 8 or 9 return on their money by the time theyre ready to retire they would have close to 1 million
2734290 if i know that this account is my spending account thats the first one im going to put my hands on
2734291 if i know my other account is my vacation money im not going to touch it until i take that vacation
2734292 the way i think about saving is i call it spending money at the freedom store
2734293 just like you buy a product or buy a service you buy freedom and every time you put money into savings you are a little more free than you were before
2734294 youd better have a say so on how its being run because nine out of 10 of us are going to have to take care of our own money at some point
2734295 the reason people get themselves in trouble financially is because they dont have anything in savings
2734296 they think that because they own a home and theyre building equity or they have money in their 401 k thats enough if theres an emergency or the car breaks down then they start borrowing money
2734297 people say i should buy a vacation because i will learn about the world
2734298 you have to compare financial freedom to the benefit of the trip around the world
2734299 after youve gotten serious about saving for six months what youll find is you actually like it spending is addictive but saving gets addictive too
2734300 io vedo il venditore di giornali allangolo della strada con la stessa regolarita con cui vedo mia moglie ma il primo e meno importante per me e io non sono in rapporti di amicizia con lui egli pu restare relativamente anonimo per me il grado di interesse e il grado di intimita possono combinarsi nellaccrescere o nellattenuare lanonimia dellesperienza e posso anche influenzarlo indipendentemente

2734356 recollections at a distance of several decades corrupted as such recollections must be not only by the passage of time but also by opinion conscious or unconscious seemed of little use to me they could not get me any nearer to any kind of truth for that is to my mind simply never to be found

2734569 no country will want to buy the system if it is proven to be ineffective
2734570 for these reasons russia may not deliver it in the end to iran

2734727 adrian lynes remake is the faithful adaptation that book deserves
2734728 absurd the book is a multifaceted comic marvel lynes film is a humorless slog

2734731 brad i am curious to know how long it took you to read la recherche and hoe it affected your response to the movie
2734732 did you read the old translation or the new one
2734733 i think renoirs version of madame bovary is awful but that never prevented me from loving renoir
2734734 brad you read the latest translation the interesting thing about it is that each volume is translated by a different person

2734736 brad i dont quite see how the alexandria quartet is proustian except in a rather superficial way reading it has absolutely nothing to do with my experience of reading proust it requires effort whereas proust is pure joy of reading of course again thats just me
2734737 on ruiz and proust id say that what passes as still rather rationalist prose on the pages of prousts

2734741 recalling james woods quip somewhere that modernism is about consciouness and post modernism about narrative
2734742 interesting that you should mention this because one of the reasons im responding so strongly to the alexandria quartet is that it has helped me to clarify the essential difference between modernism and post modernism namely that for modernism narrative is a problem whereas for post modernism narrative is a joke this is why i value david lynchs recent films from twin peaks fire walk with me to inland empire more than his earlier ones blue velvet wild at heart hes a rare example of an artist progressing from a post modernist position to modernist one

2734749 this is what archaeologists have learned from their excavations in the land of israel the israelites were never in egypt did not wander in the desert did not conquer the land in a military campaign and did not pass it on to the 12 tribes of israel

2734832 i have no idea why they did it and am not aware of any violation of the rules to sell software on the app store
2734833 i am sure a lot more people would like to buy it but currently cant do so
2734834 the app is a work of art and included a secret mantra thats all
2734835 i saw this app with a few friends and we jokingly clicked buy thinking it was a joke to see what would happen this is no joke do not buy this app and apple please remove this from the app store
2734836 ive got e mails from customers telling me that they really love the app
2734837 i dont want to collect money from people who did this by accident and i am glad that apple returned the money for two orders
2734838 its a great work of art my guess is it will increase in value and was a bargain at 999 99
2734839 umm where is the evidence that the people who bought this are mac users
2734840 you realise that using an iphone makes you a mac user so you can all stfu

2734844 with people being hurt in the world and all we can do with technology is make ways to spend money on stupid stuff like this
2734845 you still have to type in your itunes password before purchasing so its extremely unlikely anyone purchased it accidentally with a swipe
2734846 if the apple website does not ask for verification that you actually want to purchase something after a single click then something is wrong with the site
2734847 i enjoy wasting money on shiny crap because it makes me look cool

2734869 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2734870 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2734871 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2734872 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
2734873 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient
2734874 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2734875 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2734876 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2734877 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2734878 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2734898 this statement is new to us and it requires analysis
2734899 it is a case of a third party intervening in the process which is quite surprising
2734900 i must report to you that many non muslims feel marginalised in todays malaysia
2734901 in schools our children are not permitted to and do not get education in their own religion moral lessons are reportedly vetted by the islamic authorities
2734902 i cant see any earthly reason in this world why he should be remanded to donegal
2734903 i didnt make myself known i just stood at the back of the chapel and paid my respects
2734904 i felt i had to go it was something i just had to do
2734905 i love the passionate electricity power is such an aphrodisiac
2734906 id love to do a romantic comedy with angelina jolie shes kind of flawless to me
2734907 sometimes i think its harder to be a leading man in a romantic comedy if youre not english
2734908 i think the english do that really really well that sort of slightly camp slightly pathetic thing
2734909 i dont think angelina would want to do a romantic comedy with me though
2734910 im not saying colin firth or hugh grant are pathetic far from it
2734911 i think they are both great but i would like to have a crack at it too
2734912 i am a stunning young model from poland who loves belfast
2734913 i look forward to meeting you so that you can live your fantasies and allow both of us to have a good time
2734914 there are dangerous people out there but we stay in the hotel because they are usually safe
2734915 if theres a problem with one of the men then i will just scream for help hotels are a lot safer than going to a private address
2734916 i work for myself so why should i want to give anyone else money this is a business and we work hard for our clients
2734917 i wont answer private numbers and i always make sure that i get my clients mobile phone number
2734918 ive never been attacked and i dont want this to happen either this would be bad for me and for any of the other girls
2734919 the police are on to people like me and my friends we are very worried
2734920 but they wont stop the business or keep us away from belfast because business is just so good in this town
2734921 you took up my time so thats why i have charged you
2734922 we have additional security procedures in place to try to prevent this type of activity and restrict non guests gaining access to hotel rooms
2734923 our staff are extremely vigilant and this problem is very rare but should we suspect any activity of this nature we would ask the guest to leave
2734924 we are opposed to the abuse of young women in the sex trade and this is not the type of activity we want to see in hotels
2734925 it is a matter for the hotel about what goes on behind its doors
2734926 as i was coming home i heard the roar of jets
2734927 i fell to the ground instinctively and then there were these painfully loud bangs
2734928 they were such lovely people they were so excited about the baby
2734929 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2734930 they are killing civilians women and children with heavy artillery and rockets
2734931 there have certainly been a lot of casualties the street next to ours was hit by firing and we saw bodies being taken away we are staying inside the house we have got three young children and they are very frightened
2734932 i went out and saw burnt tanks with dead bodies the police said that they were georgians who had been trying to come into the city then we heard planes and what sounded like firing from helicopters but it is very confusing and we dont know whats really going on
2734933 our peacekeepers and units subordinate to them are now carrying out an operation to force the georgian side to peace
2734934 the town is destroyed there are many casualties many wounded
2734935 but i do support georgias president mikheil saakashvili and what russia is doing is wrong they must stop
2734936 russia has launched a full scale military invasion of georgia
2734937 stressed that the only way out of the tragic crisis provoked by the georgian leadership is a withdrawal by tbilisi of its armed formations from the conflict zone
2734938 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2734939 det r inte alls lika mysigt i stors ngen nu n r mamma r s h r stor o tjock jag snarkar och fiser j tteilla hela tiden s inte ens pappa orkar ligga kvar en hel natt
2734940 there is no mehdi army here there is only the iraqi army

2734942 theres a period of restructuring going on theyre kind of seeing whos around whats left what kind of capabilities they have
2734943 its keeping out elements that people dont want around anymore
2734944 no one wants to live in a prison but right now this is useful for us

2734950 the key this time is there are a fair number of battleground states that are becoming more diverse and maybe diverse enough to make a difference
2734951 the diversity used to be mainly in pretty safe states like texas california and new york
2734952 but is he generating enough enthusiasm to excite people who lack a formal education and are disproportionately young and not likely to vote
2734953 in many ways demographic differences are the raw material for party politics
2734954 if the election is close it could come down to small demographic changes in some areas
2734955 for a long time we have not pursued sunday sales in the legislature
2734956 the next session will give us the first opportunity to do that
2734957 the public policy is vastly inconsistent in the state of indiana
2734958 i know there are voters that do and i want to hear from them
2734959 phelps was an all star he is what he is
2734960 and he was the only one who was able to step up his game from the heats to the final it shows how good of a swimmer he is
2734961 but at the same time its all about competing i was just happy to go in there race against these guys and show that we belong
2734962 the main thing was to get into the final its going to be a little bit of a theme probably that these finals are so tough to make you really have to compete in the heats
2734963 so to be able to come back around and do it again in finals is definitely a challenge
2734964 ah i cant say that anything he does surprises me i mean this is the tiger woods of swimming here hes a superstar hes one of a kind and at the same time he makes everybody else better by going after him and even though he had the race pretty well today hes got a lot of races left and theres somebody whos gearing up to beat him every single day itll be exciting to watch him swim every day
2734965 he put on an amazing performance against a guy who would not quit a guy who just kept taking a ton of punishment gsp looked unstoppable tonight
2734966 im really disappointed i feel like i let a lot of people down
2734967 my teammates my girlfriend my family its just hard it really is i had a lot of people come out to watch me tonight they dont have a lot of money but they spent what they had to come here and watch and i still didnt win so i feel bad about that

2735046 it is sad if one day the people see this problem as synonymous with umno so the situation must be corrected before the next general election

2735055 not only do children lie but they begin at about four years of age 2 5 3 years depending on whom you believe and lying is a normal in fact critical part of their development
2735056 when people lie they are trying to create a false belief in another person but to attempt this the liar must understand that the other person has beliefs knowledge and opinions that are different from theirs and thus can be manipulated you need stresses talwar a theory of mind that differentiates my mind from your mind something that requires a high level of intellectual development
2735057 e ven customs agents and police officers couldnt spot the lying subjects more than 50 per cent of the time in other words their accuracy was no better than chance they might as well have flipped a coin
2735058 showed video tapes of liars and truth tellers to various groups of experts including polygraph operators robbery investigators judges and psychiatrists and asked them to try to identify the lies all tried their best none of the groups performed better than chance
2735059 identified an extremely rare group of people who could nail a fibber 80 to 90 per cent of the time more accurate than a polygraph what the researchers wondered were these human lie detectors seeing that the rest of us miss
2735060 lying it turns out is highly individual what signals a lie in one person might be a cue to truthfulness in another
2735061 liars often try psychologically to distance themselves from their falsehoods and so tend to include fewer references to themselves in their stories
2735062 according to harvard neuroscientist stephen kosslyn even the brain seems to function differently depending on the type of lie and the person lying
2735063 found that quite distinct neural systems were activated when youre lying based on a well memorized coherent alternative story versus when youre making something up on the fly some of the structures that are active when youre spewing out memorized lies are known to be involved in the retrieval of stored memory but these systems aremore active when youre lying than when youre telling the truth so its not just a case of drawing forth a memory and says kosslyn fabricating lies on the spot will light up another part of the brain known as the anterior cingulate a structure involved in monitoring errors probably whats going on is youre trying to suppress the truth its not activated when youre using memorized lies people even use different parts of the brain when lying about themselves i didnt do it than when lying about someone else he didnt do it
2735064 we document violence in order to minimize it while the btselem organization along with the palestinians documents violence in order to humiliate the state of israel

2735066 in regards to the settlers there are two things we are interested in
2735067 hamas police never interfered in that what women wear and they never uttered one word
2735068 the thing is that hamas wants to get secularist people to be on its side for the time being and to avoid looking like the iranian regime
2735069 ordering people to do good things and to avoid bad doings
2735070 the gaza strip will become a large version of the islamic university in gaza
2735071 it seems those girls use shoe horn to insert their bodies inside those trousers
2735072 i will not change the way i dress but if a decree is issued to change gaza into an islamic emirate i will wear hijab
2735073 it is not about the way one dresses and there are many decent girls who do not wear hijab
2735074 many other girls who wear hijab but are not decent
2735075 what makes thing even worse is that some girls wear hijab and syrian long gown the overcoat worn on top of long pants and long sleeves but the gown is as tight as a belly dancing belt not to mention the perfumes and makeup
2735076 good for hamas because people will avoid comparing hamas to the taliban
2735077 during the last four days more than 100 militants have been killed and nine security personnel have also died
2735078 the troops casualties may rise as some of their soldiers were missing

2735097 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
2735098 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
2735099 you know if youve ever seen the vice presidents stationery its on the white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of the vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you
2735100 this posting is contrary to my practice across 25 years as a journalist but the issues in this matter are simply too important to stand as discredited in any way
2735101 i would say right it came to us george had a raised eyebrow and basically we passed it on it was to and passed this on into the organization
2735102 in the coming weeks t mobile will be offering new ways to go to market
2735103 you are not fit to be unchained from your damned servitude away you imbecile since if from her empire we were to liberate the slave youd raise the carrion of your vampire by your own kisses from the grave

2735106 israel needs to be very careful and sensitive these days
2735107 the russians are selling many arms to iran and syria and there is no need to offer them an excuse to sell even more advanced weapons
2735108 i dont save the search terms and i delete all my logs every week so even if the f b i come around and ask me questions i dont know the answer because i dont have the logs any more
2735109 i dont associate the search terms with the users address at all so i cant even match those up
2735110 we have great ambitions in warship building currently 38 vessels including one aircraft carrier three frigates six submarines one landing ship and four anti submarine vessels are under development
2735111 we communicated that message beforehand to the russians through u s secretary of state condoleezza rice
2735112 we must check all that we dont trust the georgian side
2735113 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2735114 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2735115 the deployment is quite natural we dont want a repeat of what happened in south ossetia
2735116 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2735117 if it is hanging as wall art for more than 6 months it goes
2735118 my house shook 10 km away the sky was rumbling every few seconds
2735119 we dont know whether the explosion was chemical or by virtue of its proximity to the toronto airport if a plane had crashed
2735120 the cotton factory is a huge success but until we get some progress on the rest of that corridor its still an unfinished project
2735121 everybodys frustrated the citys frustrated the property owners out there are frustrated we all want to see this thing happen
2735122 it will be exciting for the people in rock hill to see this happen
2735123 the private parties theyve got to get in the game and participate at the same level
2735124 there doesnt seem to be much motion on the part of the key property owners one way or another that ive seen
2735125 maybe more than anyone i would like to see us be further along
2735126 i still believe the vision that was outlined will be accomplished it just may not be exactly on the timetable that we would prefer
2735127 all those little factors made us decide it was worth investing
2735128 im hoping and praying were at the end of our laundry list
2735129 there are times i think we take 10 steps forward and four steps back we keep working at it
2735130 when its all said and done im going to look back and say yeah you needed to do what you did
2735131 having a college town environment around the campus is winthrops top priority now
2735132 we continue to be hopeful for the kind of development that complements our own
2735133 when i started within two weeks we had a 100 year flood we had four presidential declarations of disaster in five years floods the 1998 ice storm
2735134 the ice storm took us by surprise thats why i didnt want this winter to take us by surprise
2735135 people may be forced to make a choice between buying food and buying fuel we need to be ready to deal with those kinds of situations we may have to open shelters and help people move to a safe place to make sure they have heat
2735136 we did buyouts and got rid of homes in harms way many of them were homes built right along a river
2735137 it had been going on for a long time i worked with four different jay supervisors the alternate solution was build a new bridge restore the old bridge people are generally pleased with the result
2735138 i investigated and found an appropriate use would be for county department of public health we got it and moved public health and the office for the aging there it was a good use for that building
2735139 my opinion is the nursing home should stay as the county nursing home its a place of last resort county nursing homes across the state are filled with people with alzheimers and dementia the people in that nursing home might not have a place to go otherwise
2735140 if we are running in the red its money we are spending on our own people who need that kind of care
2735141 we have a high bond rating which helps us when we have to borrow a 17 million fund balance a property tax rate thats only about 3 per 1 000 of assessment and weve developed cost effective services
2735142 it was some unusual circumstances i happened to be in that resulted in that i certainly paid my dues
2735143 it is this elephant in the room thats been growing more obese this decade that everyone refuses to recognize
2735144 the issue is somebodys paying all this stuff has a cost
2735145 when i started teaching i was making 5 000 a year it took me 15 years to pay off my student loans
2735146 my compensation was also high in comparison to others and that got factored in
2735147 vacation time was always in the summer and i was fortunate to have good health all those years
2735148 although not in any way a typical practice among superintendents i am nevertheless embarrassed when these reports surface
2735149 the public pension system is already a substantial benefit that shouldnt require additional tweaking to squeeze out a few more dollars
2735150 the pension fund is essentially the taxpayers of new york state

2735178 if you shut the fuck up for thirty seconds you might actually learn something
2735179 now theres a look in your eyes like black holes in the sky
2735180 in a world we need to share its not enough to stand and stare
2735181 the memories of a man in his old age are the deeds of a man in his prime
2735182 if you wanna find out whats behind these cold eyes youll just have to claw your way through this disguise
2735183 people come people go some grow young some grow cold
2735184 think shes kinda neat then she tells me im a creep friends dont mean a thing guess ill leave it up to me

2735217 el objetivo est cumplido hay que avanzar para todo lo excitante que a n resta
2735218 yo sab a que esta iba a ser una carrera bastante emocionante
2735219 de todos modos no fue un triunfo c modo ya que los tres en alusi n a sus compa eros de podio estuvimos bastante tiempo juntos
2735220 arranqu bien y en los primeros 200 me mantuve pero despu s me fui cansando
2735221 pero trat de mantener la calma como fuese posible y no pensar en la competencia
2735222 todo el mundo ha hecho un gran trabajo y estamos realmente satisfechos con la plata
2735223 no hay nada que objetar el triunfo de gheorghe fue claro boxeo mejor tuvo mayor rapidez y siempre se impuso a jonathan
2735224 ten a la esperanza que gonz lez hubiese hecho al mejor las cosas pero nunca pudo entrar en ritmo ante la agresividad del rival
2735225 le queda por delante mucho tiempo para mejorar y adem s perdi ante un medallista ol mpico por lo que s lo debemos sacar conclusiones positivas
2735226 tenemos a cuatro boxeadores que est n dentro de la competici n y debemos pensar de forma optimista
2735227 es importante que estos partidos sean r pidos porque en este torneo hay que encadenar muchos estoy contento por la victoria que me permite mantener vivo el sue o
2735228 no tengo nada que objetar a la derrota no hice mi mejor boxeo y mi rival fue superior se aprovech de mi debilidad
2735229 tal vez estuvo un poco nervioso y no me concentr en el cuadril tero
2735230 tengo s lo 18 a os y aunque la derrota duele al final todo ser positivo para mi y ahora me dedicar a apoyar al resto de mis compa eros que est n en competici n

2735233 ha marcado dos goles ha realizado buenos pases ha sido de los mejores del equipo
2735234 las estad sticas lo dicen tuvimos m s cortos m s penetraciones al rea y no lo supimos definirlas ellas llegaron menos y tuvieron un corto que supieron meter y una jugada que fue un error nuestro y cost el gol de ellas
2735235 una se va caliente por el hecho de que era un partido donde fuimos superiores pero no lo pudimos lograr hay que llevarlo a los partidos siguientes donde si uno tiene m s cortos hay que saber definir
2735236 esto termina ac ma ana empezaremos a analizar todo lo que corresponde a gran breta a olvid ndonos de estados unidos y saliendo a ganar como hacemos en todos los partidos
2735237 no sal al cuadril tero pensando en mi rival sino en hacer mi pelea
2735238 ten a confianza que pod a ganar y el objetivo est cumplido
2735239 como sucedi en mi debut no estoy preocupado por quien puede ser mi rival sino por lo que tengo que hacer yo mismo en el cuadril tero
2735240 estoy muy ilusionado por el triunfo por tener la posibilidad de esta vez superar la segunda ronda
2735241 hice una buena pelea y aunque el rival ataco fuerte en el cuarto asalto mis piernas no me fallaron y tambi n el directo me ayudo
2735242 en atenas perd por el bronce aqu vine por el oro
2735243 me entren seis meses seguidos lejos de mis dos hijos jessica de cuatro a os y adonis de dos no estuve con ellos en el cumplea os en marzo esta victoria y las que sigan son para ellos

2735245 mejora econ mica para darle a mis hijos lo que yo no tuve cuando ni o
2735246 creo que fue superior a mi rival que no hizo nada de boxeo se limit a agarrarme y no dejar que pele ramos
2735247 no perd el combate simplemente mi rival se dedic a agarrarme todo el tiempo
2735248 me duele quedar eliminado tan r pido hice todo lo que pude pero mi rival tuvo m s potencia trabaj bien la distancia e boxeo mejor sencillamente fue mejor
2735249 entrenar tanto durante cuatro a os para s lo competir una vez es muy duro pero el rival tambi n cuenta y hay que admitirlo
2735250 no hay nada que objetar el triunfo de gheorghe fue claro boxeo mejor tuvo mayor rapidez y siempre se impuso a jonathan
2735251 ten a la esperanza que gonz lez hubiese hecho algo mejor las cosas pero nunca pudo entrar en ritmo ante la agresividad del rival

2735331 but when we talked about advertising in general really what we found was theres no home runs in the financial services category
2735332 theres this whole theory about whether you need to speak to women in pink you dont need to
2735333 you need to talk to them as equals but you also need to reduce the jargon financial categories are known for keeping their own money speak women would prefer you lay out the deal in fine english its a little bit like you have something to hide if youre speaking in the category language

2735353 in order to prevent the circumstances in which ukraine could be drawn into a military conflict ukraine reserves the right to bar ships which may take part in these actions from returning to the ukrainian territory until the conflict is solved

2735389 may have ended his public life but he certainly ratified an end to the era in which traditional media set the agenda for national political journalism
2735390 it seems likely to me that edwards will go on to be an effective advocate to end poverty i hope so
2735391 i think john edwards will make a great attorney general i know john and elizabeth edwards will continue to fight for working people
2735392 john edwards is still a fine human being of course the preponderance of his performance in the public realm has been of great benefit to many

2735401 bizzyblog made my point with numbers and facts and stuff
2735402 this is why i read bizzy blog he catches the stuff that i manage to miss
2735403 i look at the awful photos and think how much better they could be
2735404 you dont always need an expensive new camera to take better photos learning properly how to use the one youve got is often all it takes
2735405 in the current climate its the more farsighted agencies that are realising the importance of training in all aspects of their business survival and photography is one area many just never bothered about in the good times
2735406 as a professional property photographer fewer agents can justify my fees for ordinary domestic properties but they can benefit from my expertise whats more when the upturn comes who are they going to think of to photograph their top end properties
2735407 i dont just say no to anybody because id hope that people wouldnt say no to me just because im an actor but they would have to be pretty extraordinary

2735416 i knew what i was told about the war was totally false
2735417 in 1968 i came back and dan was across the hall at rand
2735418 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore
2735419 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me
2735420 for somebody who has been called elitist going to hawaii is not exactly going against type

2735463 ik haat het dat tien mannen van middelbare leeftijd me overal volgen waar ik ga
2735464 ik begrijp dat het de prijs is die ik betaal voor mijn mooie huis en kleding ik behandel ze met respect terwijl ze dat eigenlijk niet echt verdienen
2735465 het is verschrikkelijk g nant en eenzaam als ik op straat word gevolgd door cameras die de aandacht trekken waarop mensen naar me wijzen en hun fototoestellen en telefoons richten op het tafereel
2735466 soms wordt het me te veel dus als je fotos ziet met de kop lily allen chagrijnig of lily allen weer in tranen weet dan dat het niet om mijn relatie gaat en dat ik geen kater heb het gaat erom dat ik alleen ben en mensen naar me wijzen alsof ik een dier in de dierentuin ben en tien tot twintig mannen daar hun geld mee verdienen

2735476 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
2735477 by asking the iraqis to take responsibility for their future and to invest in their own country
2735478 sen mccain talks about putting our country first but he is running for a third term of the very same policies that have set our country back
2735479 and begun to end the tyranny of oil in our time
2735480 i would be very direct with russian president vladimir putin that these actions will have consequences long term in terms of our relationship with russia and it is in violation of the norms of international conduct

2735513 in certain areas of north cotabato with a specific group of milf all peaceful means have been exhausted to resolve the conflicts and we are now compelled to resort to the application of justifiable force
2735514 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
2735515 the only result of the use of airstrikes is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism
2735516 abandon the idea that the afghan government will be under its control
2735517 we do not want to be the slaves or puppets of other countries
2735518 a call to action saving lives through nuclear weapons control and disarmament
2735519 it felt like someone had opened the door of a furnace behind you

2735526 no one wants to live in a prison but right now this is useful for us
2735527 people have come to the conclusion that the closer he is to wanting to obtain power the more difficult others will make it for him to achieve that
2735528 a lot of people are very tired after living through the first sodomy trial which had a chilling effect on the country even until today people thought it was blatant political manoeuvering
2735529 the new sodomy charges against anwar ibrahim are all a political game because he is now a real threat to the prime minister
2735530 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly
2735531 it looks like the government is out to fix him again everyone knows that the charge against him is nothing but a lie
2735532 the only thing we can do now is to vote for anwar and make sure he gets to parliament and eventually form the government only then can we right all that is wrong in this country
2735533 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
2735534 it would be pink on the outside pink carpets pink furniture pink jammies the men on her staff would be cool with be shirtless chippendale types with names like leon

2735536 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here
2735537 the first half of every conference would be about what shes wearing paris would realize that as president she would have to tone it down a little shed lean toward prada
2735538 what would happen is rihanna would step off the plane in fishnet stockings music would blare and whole countries would melt at the sight of her
2735539 it would be like bush at the crawford ranch she would be in l a more than she would in washington d c
2735540 a large trend is being crystallized among the palestinian national authority pna in ramallah to call for settling the situation with the gaza strip by force
2735541 to give the last chance for the egyptian government and the arab league to convince hamas to immediately end its coup and engage in the dialogue
2735542 but the door for dialogue will not be open forever and the leadership only gave one month time for the efforts
2735543 will be a dangerous thing if it was officially made

2735549 county fermanagh is one of the finest parts of northern ireland we are surrounded by beautiful scenery ranging from the lakes to the caves at marble arch to wonderful parks such as castle coole at a time when homes across northern ireland are feeling the pinch due to increasing financial hardship it is vital that we put ourselves out there and let people know that fermanagh is an area they can come to and have a truly enjoyable experience i know that destination fermanagh have strived to do this and indeed i was delighted to hear that many of our local attractions have been doing well over the moth of july
2735550 however despite the wonderful work within the county it seems that others dont want to help us promote the local area as i believe it should be the fact that destination fermanagh has only received a paltry 41 000 from deti compared to over 7 million going to other signature projects simply isnt good enough we deserve more than the table scraps and yet that is all we appear to be getting
2735551 if i am elected on the 17 th september i will certainly be putting forward the case for fermanagh that we deserve more funding for tourism deti cannot be allowed to undervalue our county while other parts of northern ireland receive cash boosts of millions during my previous time as a member of the council i was proud to sit among my fellow councillors and on the board of fermanagh lakeland tourism to fight for proper recognition for the county in terms of tourism and other issues and i am eager to do so again
2735552 the law on caravans has not been updated in ni since 1963 in which no provisions were set aside for caravan owners and permanent residents in caravans unlike mainland uk where the mobile homes act 1983 extended rights throughout the rest of the uk
2735553 at present i am conducting a consultation process by informing many interested parties and councils across ni of the proposed legislation the bill will redefine the definition of caravan to include mobile homes and park homes and afford protection to owners who rent their pitch from a site owner by making it an offence to harass interfere with the peace or comfort persistently withdraw or withhold reasonable required services or unlawfully evict the occupiers
2735554 caravanning has huge economic importance across ni and is vital within the south down area the local economic benefits that caravanners bring becomes hugely prevalent throughout the summer months
2735555 this move to protect caravanners and bring ni in line with the rest of the uk has become necessary a number of cases have been brought to my attention in which caravanners were required to purchase most of their goods and services through the site owner another instance included caravanners having to upgrade their caravans after a certain time period and could only sell the caravan back to the owner most often at an extremely reduced rate
2735556 when researching many of these cases it became evident that caravan owners and park owners were both extremely unclear about their legal rights and in some cases whether they had any at all therefore resulting in the complicated and often unfair treatment of caravan owners
2735557 the purpose of the new bill will be to provide caravan owners with improved legal protection it will also provide clear structures for both caravan owners and park owners about their legal rights and obligations through the implementation of written agreements for both existing residents and prospective residents
2735558 the consultation on the draft bill concludes on september 12 i have already received very positive feedback from many of the consultees i would urge anyone with a vested interest to read the draft bill which can be found on my website
2735559 cookstown is a major commercial area in mid ulster and northern ireland this reconstruction is needed on the a29 trunk road to increase the quality of the road and allow it to take the volumes of traffic that drive over it daily safe
2735560 however the works will be taking place as the new school year begins and hundreds of families will be disrupted while the construction takes place
2735561 just as cookstown is an important town so are stewartstown and coagh stewartstown is a major by pass for cookstown dungannon the m1 and gets a heavy volume of transport vehicles travelling on it every day as such work on these important roads would be justified
2735562 after speaking to a roads service representative i have learned that the roads in stewartstown and coagh are simply under a repair when in needed scheme whereby they will only get repaired when damaged and will not be resurfaced
2735563 i have written to the minister of department of regional development to ask for additional funding to be freed up so that the roads through stewartstown and coagh areas can be improved
2735564 luckily this womans daughter was in the house at the time and when she thought something was amiss she took the phone from her mum and questioned him he then hung up
2735565 as a local resident and user of the greenway myself i fully understand the anxiety felt by local people at the possible loss of this first class amenity
2735566 i pointed out to the group that it will be difficult to persuade the authorities to abandon a public transport route which has be designated for many years nevertheless the evidence from a recent report is not convincing that there would be genuine growth in the numbers using this route instead of their cars would we end up making it more difficult for commuters on the newtownards road including damage to local shopping areas and encouraging more development at the dundonald end of the railway line
2735567 these are some of the tough questions to be answered by the department of regional development as we go forward the one question which came up time and time again was how would a future e way mergewith traffic at the holywood arches
2735568 i have been working for the past two weeks to have the material for this bonfire removed and have the bonfire itself abandoned i am extremely concerned that it will be used to incite tensions in the area it is my belief that such a bonfire will only serve to intimidate and promote ill feeling between the communities the vast majority of which do not want this event taking place

2735598 i can remember hearing of africa for the africans ethiopians awake
2735599 i can remember accurately the very first set of books that really impressed me
2735600 j a rogers three volumes told about aesop being a black man who told fables about the great coptic christian empires about ethiopia the earths oldest continuous black civilization
2735601 i see a great ray of light and the bursting of a mighty political cloud which will bring you complete freedom
2735602 when i arrived in ethiopia the king was glad to see me i took off with a french pilot we climbed to 5 000 ft as 50 000 people cheered and then i jumped out and tugged open my parachute i floated down to within 40 ft of the king who incidentally is the greatest of all modern rulers he rushed up and pinned the highest medal given in that country on my breast made me a colonel and the leader of his air force and here i am

2735629 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2735630 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2735631 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2735632 mad she was angry furious would be a good way to describe it
2735633 she should not be involved in protecting me from whatever the consequences of this are
2735634 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2735635 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2735636 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2735637 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2735638 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2735639 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
2735640 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
2735641 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
2735642 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
2735643 cheated on more times than a blind woman playing scrabble with gypsies
2735644 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2735645 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2735646 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2735647 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2735648 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2735649 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2735650 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2735651 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2735652 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2735653 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2735654 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2735655 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2735656 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2735657 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2735658 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2735659 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2735660 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2735661 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
2735662 the one constant in republican victories in fall elections has been large margins in springfield and those surrounding counties
2735663 if you dont campaign hard in a region of the state that is growing that represents a lot of votes
2735664 a good performing republican will get 65 percent of the vote in greene and surrounding counties
2735665 this race will be fought and won in the margins
2735666 if youre a democrat and cant get north of 40 percent in greene county youre in trouble
2735667 a lot of things hes said have really turned off and angered a lot of people including greene county democrats
2735668 the threat of obama is enough to get the hard core conservatives out
2735669 some places were unprepared some places just couldnt handle it
2735670 people know its going to be a historically high turnout whether they can do anything about it is another question
2735671 tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of voters are disenfranchised sometimes raising serious questions about whether the intended choice of the voters was certified as the winner
2735672 the first couple of primaries get all the attention its decided and nobody turns out for other elections later on in the primary season
2735673 and that didnt happen this time and i think thats where some elections administrators in later primaries got caught
2735674 some might get lost or replaced or the person didnt fill out all the information and theyre not on the rolls
2735675 the fishbein family came up with the idea of giving this trail as a gift
2735676 in 1993 we built our first green building but it didnt create the buzz this building has so we can thank al gore or oil at 140 a barrel our trail has come along at the right time and very much with a purpose
2735677 we wanted to see the composting toilets in any building approved and open to the public
2735678 if small children and international visitors accepted the bathrooms we concluded friends and relatives could accept this idea
2735679 the more we did the more we wanted to do
2735680 this stands as a shining example of what can and should be done in new construction
2735681 this building is very advanced and very functional but has much less of an environmental footprint than any traditional building would
2735682 if we are to live sustainably in the future we really have to change the way we live
2735683 climate change is the number one issue of our time
2735684 at mass audubon we are making a tremendous effort in this area
2735685 seven thousand people in july alone came through this building
2735686 a lot of people were interested in green features and how they could apply them to their own home
2735687 things can be a little more expensive but over time it pays for itself and uses less energy green materials dont have to be renewed and the more and more green materials are produced the price will come down
2735688 it had to grow organically and look like it was part of a whole
2735689 i dont know how much we raised here but its probably something that starts with a four
2735690 this is one of the best events weve seen in a while
2735691 and thats where the big money really is there are these wealthy people here who put on these lavish fundraisers and they bring in wealthy people from boston or new york it turns into a lot of money
2735692 to win the presidency you have to make sure you have the money and the resources to go out there and tell the truth this area is a great resource to have
2735693 i had to donate the maximum this time this election is too important i needed to put my money where my ideals were
2735694 obviously a lot of money comes out of those things
2735695 youve got a lot of high powered people in one room thats not necessarily representative of the island as a whole weve got a very strong republican network here
2735696 this election simply wont work if people dont participate and money is one important way to participate
2735697 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
2735698 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
2735699 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
2735700 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
2735701 a lot of people are disappointed that we elected a democratic congress in 2006 to end the war and nothing happened
2735702 but as voters engage they will see this campaign through the presidential race prism and thats something reichert doesnt want i view this race as a toss up
2735703 reicherts big problem isnt himself its president bush this could come down to the wire just like last time
2735704 when it comes to life and death issues politics is not a factor
2735705 he talks kind of moderate even i could vote for him
2735706 but what he actually does is something else he votes far left
2735707 i dont believe in no win wars that are just police actions
2735708 is designed to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind

2735711 hey im changing so i can get votes in texas or arizona
2735712 real results by the end of my first term in office
2735713 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
2735714 leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy
2735715 mccain did not have a great week his visual was riding around in a golf cart with old george bush the first
2735716 shears report represents a major change in the mainstream press culture of the past sixteen years
2735717 he genuinely likes reporters hell joke with us about our drinking habits playfully request our cell phones in the middle of a call and tell some unsuspecting editor or parent that the phones owner has just been hauled off to rehab and engage in gleefully sarcastic banter about both our colleagues and his
2735718 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2735719 we get blamed by people for being neanderthals but just because something is new doesnt mean its a good idea to include it in the debates
2735720 this has been something weve explored in the past and for a variety of reasons logistical and scale it couldnt come together
2735721 we offered our functionality with the notion that we knew the goal of these debates is all about information and education
2735722 its a way for americans to educate themselves in a different manner and ideally make a more informed choice when choosing their leader
2735723 i think it will change the process for elections to come
2735724 thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
2735725 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2735726 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2735727 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
2735728 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
2735729 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
2735730 baxter has a talent to define the game which is important
2735731 he can make the moment that matters that wins you a game whether it be a through pass a goal a dribble what ever it may be
2735732 he has that talent in him that is something you cannot give a player it is just inside them you have to nurture it and bring it out of him so he can perform at the highest level
2735733 but with jose we may have to wait a little longer for that strength but if he continues the way he is and maintains the right attitude to learning there is no reason why he cannot be in our first team very soon
2735734 pre season has been tough because we have really put the players through it but i have been impressed with their fitness levels attitude and energy
2735735 now the fitness is showing through the performance against psv dutch champions again confirmed that they wanted to slow the game down we wanted it speeded up to premier league levels so it was a good challenge
2735736 such a work out will be of great help when our european matches come around
2735737 the fans may be looking for big money signings but they can also see the quality coming through the youth ranks
2735738 united at that time did not seem to need to spend big on lots of players with good youngsters around
2735739 i want energy to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2735740 ive been going there as an individual businessman for 40 years to washington
2735741 the richer i got the more polite they were did i get anything done hell no
2735742 i want to get to a million people by the time congress comes back in after recess
2735743 if they see with me a million people that are gonna write to them say something to them put pressure on them theyre going to listen to us i can promise you that
2735744 i dont have any profit motive in this im doing it for america
2735745 it will be similar to the eisenhower interstate highway period in the 1950s
2735746 he said it was an emergency i want it to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2735747 and weve had a pretty good drop in the oil price
2735748 he believes in global warming i do too but global warming is on page 2 for me on page 1 its the 700 million going out the back door from our dependency on 70 percent of imported oil
2735749 and its also driving the key challenge for us which is energy independence
2735750 ive been working on this since i was elected in 1996 so i get excited whenever anybody else joins this effort
2735751 hes saying if you are not going to listen because im wealthy im going to shame you into listening to people its a great approach
2735752 he wasnt successful but he made a lot of money at it
2735753 eliminates peoples jobs and then asks the taxpayers to fund his new venture
2735754 american people are desperate for answers and if they get robbed in the process
2735755 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2735756 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2735757 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2735758 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2735759 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2735760 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2735761 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2735762 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2735763 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2735764 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2735765 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2735766 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2735767 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2735768 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2735769 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2735770 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2735771 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
2735772 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
2735773 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
2735774 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
2735775 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
2735776 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
2735777 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
2735778 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
2735779 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
2735780 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
2735781 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
2735782 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
2735783 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
2735784 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2735785 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
2735786 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
2735787 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
2735788 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
2735789 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
2735790 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
2735791 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
2735792 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
2735793 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2735794 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2735795 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2735796 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2735797 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2735798 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2735799 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2735800 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2735801 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2735802 just so you all know we did set a record
2735803 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2735804 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2735805 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2735806 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2735807 channel 4 will not be in a hurry to commission him poor old durkin again
2735808 it is entirely appropriate that people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2735809 the cake went all over me that was the end of my suit
2735810 i always wondered whether sometime a political protester would hit me with a pie in the face i never thought a friendly birthday cake would attack me from the rear
2735811 id like to hear the governor and legislative leaders tell the voters where the shortfall is coming from and unless i hear that im not sure we ought to take a gamble
2735812 education funding is very important part of our economy has to be based on attracting and keeping good paying jobs and we cant do that without a well educated work force
2735813 the jonah factor 13 spiritual steps to finding the job of a lifetime
2735814 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2735815 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2735816 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2735817 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2735818 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2735819 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2735820 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2735821 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2735822 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2735823 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2735824 if black people kill black people every day why not have a week and kill white people
2735825 are you better off now than you were four years ago
2735826 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
2735827 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2735828 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
2735829 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
2735830 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
2735831 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
2735832 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2735833 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2735834 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
2735835 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
2735836 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
2735837 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2735838 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2735839 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2735840 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2735841 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2735842 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
2735843 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2735844 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
2735845 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
2735846 clearly we shouldnt relax our guard just because we are automating the elections
2735847 this is the electronic equivalent of ballot boxes stuffed with ballots even before the voting has started
2735848 even though 27 votes each were recorded for their running mates
2735849 whether it paid bribes to win a venezuela election contract in 2004
2735850 the current way computers are used to record count and tabulate votes threatens the basic democratic principles of voting in secret and counting in public in dre you are already counting in secret
2735851 more than a technological problem election fraud is really a social problem and therefore calls for social solutions supported by technological means the only effective social solution to fraud is elections is eternal vigilance and punishment for the cheats
2735852 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone
2735853 after others learn about this new group kaya natin we can hardworking and ethical local government officials will come out hopefully
2735854 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2735855 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2735856 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2735857 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
2735858 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
2735859 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
2735860 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
2735861 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
2735862 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
2735863 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
2735864 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
2735865 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
2735866 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
2735867 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
2735868 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
2735869 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
2735870 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
2735871 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
2735872 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
2735873 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
2735874 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
2735875 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
2735876 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2735877 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2735878 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2735879 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2735880 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2735881 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2735882 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2735883 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2735884 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2735885 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2735886 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2735887 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2735888 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2735889 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
2735890 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2735891 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2735892 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2735893 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2735894 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
2735895 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
2735896 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
2735897 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
2735898 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
2735899 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
2735900 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
2735901 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2735902 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
2735903 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2735904 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
2735905 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
2735906 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
2735907 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
2735908 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
2735909 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
2735910 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
2735911 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
2735912 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
2735913 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
2735914 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
2735915 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
2735916 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
2735917 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
2735918 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
2735919 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
2735920 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
2735921 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
2735922 everybody says they want to support it but its been a tough sell
2735923 a number of utilities have reported that only 20 percent to 30 percent of their customers are aware that a green power option is offered
2735924 thats confusing they think its the wind why isnt it free
2735925 what we see in georgia is whats the minimum that we can do well take your money and well green wash and do a lot of propaganda about the program
2735926 10 years behind the curve southern co is looking at offshore wind but theyre not really advancing the ball on renewable energy in a credible or serious way
2735927 as much as 1 billion on renewable generation over the next 10 years
2735928 if they had something in place where they were doing wind turbines on the coast or solar modules or solar plants or something like that i would be more inclined to pay more for that
2735929 but its just really hard for me to justify paying more for landfill methane gas
2735930 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2735931 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2735932 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2735933 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2735934 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2735935 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2735936 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2735937 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2735938 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
2735939 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
2735940 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
2735941 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2735942 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2735943 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2735944 it is our job to clarify any confusion and misunderstanding
2735945 whatever decisions orders and policies handed down by the courts and the legal department we have to abide by them they should understand the countrys legal system
2735946 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2735947 he was absolutely marvellous so prepared so professional so enthusiastic
2735948 i didnt know jean lemire but the fact that it was a canadian piece swung me over to it
2735949 i looked at it and i really loved their work
2735950 they went through trauma and personal anguish and terrible terrible disappointment with what is happening with the world
2735951 oh i hope they get a devastating understanding of what terrible things that we are doing
2735952 just look at the wretched broadcasting in the united states during this presidential campaign its disgusting look what theyre feeding people
2735953 if barack obama is elected president then al gore will be the energy czar in the united states and that i do believe would have a very positive effect
2735954 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2735955 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2735956 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2735957 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2735958 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2735959 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2735960 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2735961 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
2735962 the only issue that hit home is the war because of him
2735963 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2735964 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2735965 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2735966 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2735967 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2735968 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2735969 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
2735970 i see a new character above all after the riots on may 1 in hamburg
2735971 the black block of neo nazis are attacking left wingers and police officers with an aggression that can be seen as a change in strategy
2735972 before neo nazis largely avoided violence for tactical reasons but this no longer appears to be the case
2735973 i see a new character above all after the riots on may 1 in hamburg
2735974 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2735975 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2735976 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2735977 i think michael phelps is going to way surpass me
2735978 im still not used to swimming fast in the morning im used to swimming at night
2735979 we started to walk towards the ready room and i was like it feels like 6 oclock at night

2735981 i remember the first race i swam against her i had to swim a world record to beat her
2735982 i know the water doesnt really know what age you are but it is kind of cute to see the innocence there
2735983 there are a lot of middle aged men and women who i know that tell me that im an inspiration to them and theyre now doing things they thought they couldnt do
2735984 im hoping that my age paves the way for other athletes who maybe think theyre too old to do something
2735985 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
2735986 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
2735987 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
2735988 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
2735989 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
2735990 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
2735991 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2735992 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2735993 mexican immigration definitely stamps passports of all passengers entering from cuba
2735994 sometimes they accept the propina and do not stamp sometimes they refuse and stamp anyway is that what you meant

2736000 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2736001 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2736002 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2736003 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2736004 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2736005 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2736006 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2736007 it was a script submitted to me about nine years ago
2736008 at the time it was about a bunch of teenagers who worked in a mall which we thought was an absolutely great concept
2736009 we noticed how to add more and more music and still keep the story moving forward it felt like you got to a certain part of the script and you just went music when i started watching every musical i could trying to understand why i liked them so much i realized music didnt stop the story and added depth to the characters
2736010 a lot of the other cast members had been involved with the project for months doing very intensive auditions
2736011 i got really lucky i had only two auditions in the space of a week then a week later we were ready to shoot
2736012 and i really loved it plus it was an amazing group of people we got along really well in real life
2736013 theres been a lot more of it over the past few years which is really fabulous
2736014 when i was in college moulin rouge came out and my friends and i obsessed over it it was the first musical that had come out in a long long time
2736015 i love playing villains theyre just delicious i try to make every person i play her own character as opposed to oh its just the ingenue i think maggie gyllenhaal does that she makes every part special and not just the girlfriend i admire that
2736016 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2736017 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2736018 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2736019 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2736020 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2736021 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2736022 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2736023 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere

2736027 we communicated that message beforehand to the russians through u s secretary of state condoleezza rice
2736028 we must check all that we dont trust the georgian side

2736119 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2736120 the talks are still ongoing theres been a great deal of progress the deal is very close it is about to be closed
2736121 our negotiators have really found compromises on all these issues
2736122 you may hear many dates but i caution you not to take any of these dates until you get the final document
2736123 we anticipate there could be a signing tomorrow after the leaders have met to thrash out the remaining issues
2736124 during the last four days more than 100 militants have been killed and nine security personnel have also died
2736125 the troops casualties may rise as some of their soldiers were missing
2736126 seeing how it worked out it was still a bit too bright compared to the actual fireworks
2736127 but most of the audience thought it was filmed live so that was mission accomplished
2736128 it would have been prohibitive to have tried to film it live
2736129 we could not put the helicopter pilot at risk by making him try to follow the firework route
2736130 as far as we are concerned we let off the fireworks thats whats important to us
2736131 we can see clearly that these forces are trying to wage a psychological and violent battle against the olympics
2736132 they want to turn the year 2008 into a year of mourning for china
2736133 obama has criticized bush for his fiscal irresponsibility and now hes using bushs baseline as a yardstick by which to measure fiscal responsibility
2736134 congress hasnt agreed to extend the bush tax cuts because they dont have the money to pay for it
2736135 its not unreasonable to say were inheriting a budget thats going to have substantial deficits into the future
2736136 said a democratic congressional aide who spoke on condition of anonymity so he could speak candidly
2736137 leaving some of the tax cuts in place would cost us a small fortune
2736138 i dont know that any blue dog has a good way to pay for that
2736139 president bush created this problem we would put in place rules so it never happens again
2736140 but a sound budget is based on making realistic promises and sticking to them
2736141 as of today most of the city tskhinvali is controlled by russian peacekeeping forces
2736142 military commanders have made their decision to pull back from tskhinvali this morning
2736143 we deplore the dangerous and disproportionate actions by russian forces and we would be particularly troubled if these attacks are continuing now as the
2736144 it is my dearest hope that military action will stop immediately and that they will abstain in the name of their common christian inheritance from further clashes and violence
2736145 the georgian tanks fired at everything they saw including women and children
2736146 its so difficult to be here and know my husband is still in
2736147 there is only one language the language of the law
2736148 theres a period of restructuring going on theyre kind of seeing whos around whats left what kind of capabilities they have
2736149 its keeping out elements that people dont want around anymore
2736150 no one wants to live in a prison but right now this is useful for us
2736151 people cant see their neighbors because of these walls the walls have disrupted this city
2736152 they have employed strategic bombers the most potent air weaponry that is in the russian arsenal they actually launched ballistic missile attacks on georgian territory
2736153 marks a severe escalation and is being conducted in areas far far from the of conflict which is where the russian side has said it needed to protect its citizens and peacekeepers so the response has been far disproportionate to whatever threat russia had been citing
2736154 it is simply not acceptable that anyone would reject an offer of a cease fire and a plea for international mediation
2736155 those are some pretty powerful words that are really not helping us to end the violence and bring together a new process that can resolve the conflict
2736156 the line were hearing right now from russia is quite tough
2736157 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings
2736158 should talk to the american people and talk to the world
2736159 a genuinely neutral mediator not the russian government must begin a process of negotiations immediately
2736160 keep georgia kind of weak and off balance and to make it hard for georgia to join nato
2736161 this is a very localized conflict there is not a danger of a regional conflict at all in our minds
2736162 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict
2736163 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected
2736164 what is clear is that russia has invaded georgias sovereign has encroached on georgias sovereignty
2736165 t he news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
2736166 mccain took an inflexible approach to addressing this issue by focusing heavily on one side without a pragmatic assessment of the situation
2736167 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
2736168 dont worrry the communists and muslims will back me up
2736169 i dont think you can isolate johns views in iraq from his experience in vietnam whether he is aware of it or not and i want to tread carefully here because i dont like psychologizing people i dont think he can separate those things in his mind in a way john is refighting the vietnam war
2736170 a lot of non black people will say that the election of barack obama is now proof we dont need affirmative action
2736171 in such a way where some of our children who are advantaged arent getting more favorable treatment than a poor white kid who has struggled more
2736172 i have no way of knowing whether i was a beneficiary of affirmative action either in my admission to harvard or my initial election to the review if i was then i certainly am not ashamed of the fact for i would argue that affirmative action is important precisely because those who benefit typically rise to the challenge when given an opportunity

2736177 we would encourage people to come and talk to us now to take advantage of some great deal they dont have to wait until a showhome is open or we have a sales presence on the development

2736179 it the blockade is necessary for preventing arms shipments to georgia by sea
2736180 police cars are driving round telling the population through loudspeakers to prepare for evacuation
2736181 we have made it clear to the russians that this will have a significant long term impact on us russian relations
2736182 we are urging an immediate ceasefire to the fighting in south ossetia and calling for a resumption of direct dialogue between the parties
2736183 there are lots of georgian bodies in different parts of the city
2736184 there is a whole entrance of a house full of bodies on geroyev street there is a body of the dead in all the house and something needs to be done quickly
2736185 why there is no information about how many civilians where killed by georgian army
2736186 why the british so dislike russians and blame them constantly
2736187 no state has the right to intervene militarily in the territory of another state simply because there are individuals there with a passport issued by that state or who are nationals of the state

2736191 normal markets possess all four of these features clarity conviction cash and closings
2736192 today were lucky to have one even in the depths of the rtc crisis we had motivated sellers and opportunistic buyers who could find cash they closed on some unbelievable long term investments now everyone is foggy headed we have reluctant emotional sellers and buyers are acting like carrion beetles
2736193 lenders have increased pricing to the point that nothings getting done private equity groups are loaded with cash but why invest today when prices could be lower tomorrow tenants meanwhile are at a standstill retailers are scrapping plans to expand even closing stores and who wants to commit to more office space
2736194 and that can work for both lenders and developers for now theres nothing we can do about clarity but there is cash for high quality transactions and conviction is up to the individual investors who make money in this environment will be the ones who get three of the four cs theyll secure cash and because of strong conviction theyll see their deals through to closing
2736195 if the legislation holds i believe we can expect two developments first there will be heightened activity in the period up to october 1st as affected homebuyers seek to lock into homes before they get sidelined and arent able to second we will see an appreciable decline in buyer activity and home sales as a result of down payment assistances elimination after october 1st buyers who could have purchased homes will have to wait or give up their search
2736196 we could see a 10 or greater decline in our already suffering housing market that potentially moves us away from a market that is recovering to one that is stinging taking this one step further i dont know how much more the broader economy could handle if a similar result took place across the united states
2736197 regardless of the side of the debate one is on the market reality is that wholesale elimination of the down payment assistance option does present a risk to the phoenix housing market its been an important enabler and i hope there is a compromise solution that congress and the president will take up before we see down payment assistance go completely away

2736201 er is een strijd gaande denk ik misschien wel tussen de vogelgrijpers en anderen en er komt een moment dat n van de krijgsbenden zijn toevlucht in deze grot zal zoeken
2736202 ik ben bang dat je gelijk hebt we zullen ons moeten weren en daar hebben we eigenlijk helemaal geen mogelijkheden voor nu we op zoek zijn naar de vrouwen we moeten eerst hen in veiligheid brengen
2736203 we moeten in geen geval naar die rook toe daar is teveel strijd
2736204 ik weet niet hoeveel volkeren er op het ogenblik met elkaar aan het vechten zijn nog maar net geleden moesten we ons schuil houden voor een grote groep krijgers op loopvoeters en andere mannen ze bleven aan de andere kant van de kloof hoewel ze de oversteek gemakkelijk hadden kunnen maken op die plek ik denk dat ze haast hadden ze gingen die kant op
2736205 de poorten waren gesloten en op de muren liepen alleen jonge mannen tot de tanden gewapend ik weet niet wat er aan de hand is hoe zijn onze vrouwen hier gekomen
2736206 zij hebben zelf hun weg gevonden jullie moeten elkaar rakelings zijn gepasseerd misschien hebebn ze zich voor jullie verscholen gehouden omdat ze wel voetstappen hoorden maar niet zagen wie het waren
2736207 wij hebben onderweg niemand gezien wel gehoord het leek of er een lange stoet mensen voorbijkwam hun stappen klonken hol misschien kwam het geluid van diep beneden ons in de kloof
2736208 dat is ons volgende probleem overal in de buurt doorkruisen legermachten het land we moeten erg goed opletten om ongemerkt verder te kunnen want voor een gevecht voel ik niet veel de meeste anderen beschikken over loopvoeters en veel meer zwaarden dan wij dat kan niet goed gaan
2736209 maar g n van ons zou erover denken om willens en wetens de verkeerde kant op te lopen en de anderen in de steek te laten
2736210 als je zo verder tegen ze spreekt zul je hun kwaadheid alleen maar vergroten
2736211 onze broeders gaan ons netzo ter harte als die van jullie
2736212 als ze nu eens opgesloten zitten bij de vogelgrijpers wat dan
2736213 onze vrouwen hebben zichzelf kunnen bevrijden zouden vier dappere mannen dat niet kunnen
2736214 het betekent dat we erg moeten uitkijken het kan zijn dat deze weg regelrecht naar de rookkolom voert en we weten niet wie we daar tegenkomen
2736215 we moeten uitkijken naar een vluchtweg voor het geval amtros en de zijnen of andere krijgers ons pad kruisen we zijn niet tegen hen opgewassen
2736216 zolang we in het bezit zijn van de kawal kan ons niets gebeuren
2736217 de kawal bevat onze herinneringen onze ervaringen en onze wijsheid niet onze wapens

2736220 der gegenseitige gedankenaustausch hat noch nicht zu wirklich neuen schlu folgerungen auf beiden seiten gef hrt die libert ren begreifen noch immer nicht recht welche funktion kollektive identit ten haben das f ngt an beim identit tsformenden charakter einer einheitlichen sprache und h rt auf bei der frage nach den alternativen zum nationalstaat ich gehe davon aus da die einzige langfristig tragbare alternative zu diesem ein imperialistisches modell w re ein ganz simples aber wichtiges merkmal von berlebensf higen gesellschaften ist der soziale kitt der ein bewu tsein f r vergangenheit und zukunft schafft auf diesen einwand habe ich von libert ren bisher noch keine gute antwort erhalten und auch wir konservative m ssen uns kritik gefallen lassen was die fruchtbarkeit dieser gemeinsamen debatte angeht unser unbehagen am wohlfahrts bzw sozialstaat bringen wir noch nicht gut genug auf den punkt und die wirtschaftspolitik ist immer noch unser gro er blinder fleck
2736221 das gegenteil von politisch links ist nicht rechts und das gegenteil von rechts ist nicht links der braune sozialismus war und ist nur eine variante des roten sozialismus das gegenteil von links und von rechts ist freiheitlich und offen sowie rechtsstaatlich im urspr nglichen sinne des wortes und freiheitlich offen und rechtsstaatlich bedeutet zugleich so viel pers nliche und private entscheidungsautonomie des b rgers als m glich und das wiederum hei t zugleich so wenig staat und politik als berhaupt m glich und so wenig parteien und funktion rskompetenzen als gerade noch denkbar

2736239 both women conducted interviews with 90 convicted rapists currently detained in four prisons in seremban johor baru kajang and sungai buloh aged 20 to 72
2736240 some believe rape is where force was used so having sex with the victim isnt rape to them they are ignorant that rape is also caused by persuasion coercion manipulation and relationship power between an older person and a young victim
2736241 similarly a 55 year old who raped his teenage neighbour as his wife had reached menopause stated
2736242 a music composer convicted of statutory rape against his teenaged stepdaughter passionately declared i am a lover not a killer
2736243 he said his stepdaughter is a hot blooded teenager who needed to be taught the right way to enjoy sex

2736245 nigerian mohammed bello abubakar 84 has advised other men not to follow his example and marry 86 women
2736246 a man with 10 wives would collapse and die but my own power is given by allah that is why i have been able to control 86 of them
2736247 i dont go looking for them they come to me i will consider the fact that god has asked me to do it and i will just marry them
2736248 as soon as i met him the headache was gone
2736249 god told me it was time to be his wife praise be to god i am his wife now
2736250 i am now the happiest woman on earth when you marry a man with 86 wives you know he knows how to look after them
2736251 they were sick and we told god and god said their time has come

2736254 el pa s est en contra de este tipo de actitudes chile quiere tener un sistema p blico de educaci n donde los profesores no se resistan a una evaluaci n por lo que ese tipo de temas es absolutamente claro que el pa s no los acepta
2736255 se mantiene la idea de la suspensi n pero nuestra postura es que estamos de acuerdo con la evaluaci n pero que est inserta dentro de una carrera profesional y se hagan modificaciones sustanciales que es la que est planteando el gobierno que son a lo menos seis y que hoy d a el ministerio no ha tenido voluntad para eso
2736256 the changes will be made by 2010 and if it happens well need to work hard to have a proper track still we must wait for bernie ecclestone decision to include mexico in formula one since there are already 18 venues and two more will accepted

2736266 mr bush decided to meet nicolas sarkozy the french president in his private quarters earlier today for an hour the new french leader confirmed
2736267 there is no doubt that the l1 authors feel that falluja is representative of the devestation in many parts of iraq and that were another survey done at the time it would have included at least similarly horrific cluster
2736268 most individuals reportedly killed by coalition forces were women and children
2736269 both sources indicate that the 2006 study by burnham et al considerably overestimated the number of violent deaths
2736270 uh none why would they who would care about a number that does not appear in the paper why not ask me about l1 critics who thought that 40 000 or 80 000 or pick your favorite number was reasonable
2736271 why not at least assign blame for the deaths of women and children accurately the cowardly insurgents who hide behind them
2736272 we oppose the surge tooth and nail despite it reducing death rates dramatically people might think we are huge hypocrites who dont really give a toss about iraqi deaths after all and are simply using this issue as propaganda
2736273 would anyone here do the same thing should we be in a fight with a foreign force i doubt it
2736274 why not at least assign blame for the deaths of women and children accurately the cowardly insurgents who hide behind them
2736275 you must never forget the wisdom of upton sinclair it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it in kanes case it is not his salary that is put in jeopardy by understanding but his hopes for wealth and status through adoption and celebration by the right wing establishment
2736276 yes the occupying force does have a responsibility to set up security forces and they are doing that
2736277 you cant on the one hand claim the political objective of the surge has failed then pretend you are concerned about iraq casusalties
2736278 most of those deaths are not from us fire deliberate or inadvertent
2736279 the war was not necessarily an immoral one in intent removing a genocidal dictator and would be conqueror is a good thing but it was conducted in such an incompetent manner that hundreds of thousands of innocent people have been killed the present administration deserves the blame for all of that
2736280 it might be true for noam but i dont think its true for the american military

2736284 due to the many caution periods it was a very difficult race for a time it appeared as if it would be very difficult for us to win however with a really good performance and thanks to audi tdi power we were able to achieve the result we wanted i m happy for the team that we brought home this double victory and it was also a very nice audi d but for marcel f ssler
2736285 the strategy that we had in our minds before the race did not work out because of the many yellows nevertheless i was able to pull away quite well unfortunately we always lost the advantage we had due to the caution periods thank god in the end it was still enough to win i m more than happy marcel f ssler must also be praised it was his first race with this car and he was able to catch the two acura hondas and thus make the audi 1 2 victory perfect this was again a great race weekend thanks to the team of audi sport north america to the boys at home and michelin
2736286 a beautiful 50th race the race was not easy especially after the penultimate restart with the two acura hondas in front of me behind these cars we lost a lot of down force so it was incredibly difficult to close the gap to them once i even went off the track at the end it worked well thanks to audi tdi power we got the acura hondas on the straights it was a nice race i spent a lot of time in the car it was a lot of fun
2736287 this was a very special race for me the final restart was unbelievable it was pretty close between brabham and the wall but i said to myself now or never it worked out i am very happy that i was able to give the second place to the team it ran very well from the beginning i am satisfied generally speaking the atmosphere at audi and in the american le mans series is perfect
2736288 i m really happy it was a very good and interesting race with many yellows some helped us some did not help us i think we did a good job marcel f ssler drove very well and integrated really well into the team there is nothing to complain about and we can go home with a smile on our faces
2736289 this was a perfect day with excellent driving from all our drivers the team did not make any mistakes our strategy and pit stops were also good and both marco and marcel made great passes at the end of the race
2736290 it is just a rough draft and ive always planned to go back and rewrite it

2736318 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2736319 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2736320 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2736321 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2736322 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2736323 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2736324 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2736325 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2736326 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2736327 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2736328 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2736329 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

2736349 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2736350 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2736351 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2736352 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2736353 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2736354 we must check all that we dont trust the georgian side
2736355 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2736356 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2736357 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2736358 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2736359 complete genocide putin also said georgia had effectively lost the right to rule the breakaway province an indication moscow could be preparing to fulfill south ossetians wish to be absorbed into russia
2736360 they may not be able to fly and with the possible exception of the transients who lifted a two tonne car off of a nine year old girl may not be able to display super human strength all these people have however demonstrated feats of extraordinary courage selflessness or honesty and kindness towards fellow human beings and all of them can be called heroes none of them fit the stereotypical image commonly associated with homeless people
2736361 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2736362 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2736363 the number of mutations neodarwinism requires to evolve a species
2736364 a cave in malta contains so many fossils that maltas present size would not keep this awesome quantity alive for just one week in america a death pit exists near hollywood with eagles doves and approximately two hundred and fifty saber tooth tigers and fifty elephants
2736365 incidentally when the spaniards migrated to america there was not one elephant to be found and not one single horse in america and yet horses have been found buried and fossilised by the hundreds and thousands in america
2736366 the geologic column was formed with great rapidity in a matter of months
2736367 so there is an open cast coal mine in germany that has a tree going through the layers of sedimentary deposit i find that very interesting and a valid challenge however name the place in germany somewhere in germany is not good enough it is rather a large place especially after unification once the location is known then i am sure there will be throngs of scientific experts examining this challenge to their current beliefs
2736368 re the global flood yes we all know that the mediterranean was flooded but that is not a global flood a global flood is impossible well not quite if all volcanic and tectonic plate movement were to stop right now i e no more mountain building then errosion given millions of years would eventually deposit all mountains content etc into rivers and ultimately the sea then and only then do you have any chance of a global flood somehow i cannot see tectonic plate activity ever stopping can you
2736369 they all take a very long time and certainly longer than this mythical 6000 years
2736370 another strawman argument says that sediments can be rapidly deposited well maybe so they can but sorry guys that does not mean that all or the majorityt of sediments have been laid down quickly lets take limestone which is basically something akin to coral like organisms dying and slowly building up layers well we can witness this today but we dont see these layers rapidly building up do we yet again a little piece of creationist information proves to be misleading which of course is the sole intent oh by the way if sediments can be rapidly deposited then that must be happening now and we should be observing the very formation of fossils
2736371 i notice you are still denying beneficial mutation even after the effort that arcana has made to point you in the direction of numerous examples of beneficial mutation how can you ignore this
2736372 anyhow all of this is wasting my precious time and i will have to sign off now
2736373 and i have pointed out that we have in fact seen increases in genetic information and have even given an example of a known mechanism for such increases much like your refusal to acknowledge transitional fossils your claim about mutations only losing genetic information is completely factually baseless
2736374 on conditon that the actors of that drama cool down their emotions and stop escalating the conflict
2736375 it seems the eu would be a less abrasive partner and peace keeping force than for instance nato and a more effective one than the u n
2736376 we are ready to act independently we are ready to enforce order and go further if there is resistance from the georgian side
2736377 we are coordinating our actions with russia our biggest friend
2736378 i have asked russian peacekeepers to reinforce their military presence on the georgian abkhaz border contacts with the current leadership of georgia are impossible
2736379 in my opinion they are already elements of some kind of genocide of the ossetian people
2736380 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
2736381 we are ready to enforce order and go further if there is resistance from the georgian side
2736382 iran is ready to offer any help under its principal policies of contributing to the establishment of peace and stability in the region
2736383 on conditon that the actors of that drama cool down their emotions and stop escalating the conflict

2736468 the essence of all advice is that one should utilize ones full time twenty four hours a day in nicely chanting and remembering the lords divine name transcendental form qualities and eternal pastimes thereby gradually engaging ones tongue and mind in this way one should reside in vraja and serve krishna under the guidance of devotees one should follow in the footsteps of the lords beloved devotees who are deeply attached to his devotional service
2736469 the thoughts of my pure devotees dwell in me their lives are fully devoted to my service and they derive great satisfaction and bliss from always enlightening one another and conversing about me
2736470 the essence of all advice is that one should utilize ones full time twenty four hours a day in nicely chanting and remembering the lords divine name transcendental form qualities and eternal pastimes thereby gradually engaging ones tongue and mind
2736471 the holy name character pastimes and activities of krishna are all transcendentally sweet like sugar candy although the tongue of one afflicted by the jaundice of avidya ignorance cannot taste anything sweet it is wonderful that simply by carefully chanting these sweet names every day a natural relish awakens within his tongue and his disease is gradually destroyed at the root

2736473 don t know about courtinterpreter net but i m back
2736474 not being able to do my job of interpreting the answers that the interpreter should not be asking for repetitions of answers
2736475 your honor the interpreter is not accurately translating what the witness is saying
2736476 why did you provide false information to the officer who stopped you
2736477 i didnt sir i told him my name is jose garcia

2736487 we must check all that we dont trust the georgian side
2736488 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2736489 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2736490 the deployment is quite natural we dont want a repeat of what happened in south ossetia
2736491 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2736492 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this

2736495 three years ago i looked for a web based license management application that could deliver flexible and easy to use functions when i could not find what i was looking for and at a price my manager would let me buy i realized the need in the market
2736496 the problem is license under utilization in the absence of real time data and active management control

2736498 it is a web based application accessible from anywhere on the network and it is also an active management tool allowing managers to view and optimize license usage in real time

2736505 at this time of the year a lot of agents are flying around and at times some are of a view that they can start to exercise some interest in their clients
2736506 anything weve said in regards of stephen has been misinterpreted and people have run away with it
2736507 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
2736508 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
2736509 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god

2736621 a partir de hoje domingo a maior parte da cidade tskhinvali est controlada pelas for as de paz da r ssia
2736622 comandantes militares tomaram a decis o de retirada de tskhinvali nesta manh
2736623 sa mos de praticamente toda oss tia do sul como mostra de nossa boa vontade para deter o enfrentamento militar
2736624 n s lamentamos as a es perigosas e desproporcionais das for as russas e ficaremos particularmente preocupados se esses ataques continuarem agora que os georgianos est o se retirando
2736625 eu tenho esperan a de que a a o militar ir parar imediatamente e que eles v o se abster em nome da heran a crist em comum de mais combates e viol ncia
2736626 os tanques da ge rgia atiraram contra tudo o que viram incluindo mulheres e crian as
2736627 acreditamos que obama vai ganhar porque a culmina o da era a favor das minorias nos eua mas isso vai gerar um contra ataque dos brancos e at uma revolu o
2736628 para n s uma luta da maioria branca contra a tirania das minorias essa era trouxe dist rbios pobreza chantagem assassinatos e poder pol tico para as minorias
2736629 muitos brancos votar o em obama mas se dar o conta de seu erro voltar o a defender os direitos da maioria e a exigir uma mudan a
2736630 votar o em obama com a esperan a de que isso lhes ajude a impulsionar uma revolu o branca
2736631 os supremacistas acham que uma vit ria de obama seria como um grito de batalha dos brancos e que milh es se unir o em sua causa e armar o a revolu o
2736632 seria um s mbolo da decad ncia do pa s e do mal pelo qual os brancos est o passando
2736633 estes grupos dizem que se sentem v timas discriminados e marginalizados e dizem se ressentir das prefer ncias concedidas s minorias acham que se a sociedade continuar enfatizando a identidade racial ent o mais e mais brancos se sentir o no direito de defender a sua
2736634 claro sinal para milh es de americanos brancos de que n o se d o conta
2736635 se uma pessoa branca defende sua heran a cultural a mesma que fundou este pa s ent o a chamam de racista

2736638 its true that we dont exactly represent a majority of secular kibbutz members but the pioneers have always been a minority the zionists were a minority among the jews those who came to the land were a minority among the zionists those who worked the land were also a minority and now we are a minority as well but i hope that soon we will be the leaders
2736639 well the word religious can be the subject of long discussions look the gerrer rebbe once said when the haskalah enlightenment came to the world with science physics etc we the religious left it for the secular jews when zionism came to the world we gave that too to the secular and now we have also left the repentance movement for the secular accordingly it looks like we the secular will also have to build the beit hamikdash
2736640 there are many religious authorities including maimonides who say that the temple must be rebuilt and so i think it should be done as a first step we must show that we control the temple mount i call upon all of israel to come to the mount on tisha bav and show that it belongs to the jewish nation
2736641 we have begun work on 120 sets of garments for regular priests not the high priest this involves special thread from india etc
2736642 america owes an enormous debt to the men and women who sacrificed so much for our nation and i believe by commencing the wounded warrior workplace initiative congress can give something back to these soldiers and their families
2736643 with more than 30 000 soldiers coming back from iraq and afghanistan with physical injuries we owe these families whatever support they need with an office filled with people who understand the daily issues wounded veterans and their families face my congressional staff will lead the congress in veteran support
2736644 these great americans and their families who sacrificed in iraq afghanistan or other places around the world have gained valuable experience and have shown tremendous leadership protecting our country and i think it is important for congress and the american people to listen to what they have to say
2736645 if the halls of congress are filled with wounded veterans and their families congress cant help but learn more and do more to support our military if every member of congress joins the wounded warrior workplace initiative and makes the straniere pledge the nations leaders will never be able to forget their sacrifices
2736646 by giving veterans and their family members a job in politics and government they will be given an opportunity to learn how the political and governmental institutions work and how they can influence them for the good of our national security
2736647 in order to guarantee yourself a specified minimum future income regardless of market swings if your contract is annuitized election in grip ii is irrevocable and a fee of 45 of the income base will be charged on each contract anniversary or upon full withdrawal
2736648 the grip ii benefit does not provide a cash value guarantee nor is it a guarantee of any investment option grip ii can only be converted to a lifetime income stream upon annutization on any contract anniversary after your earliest election date
2736649 if you have both types of accounts you should hold the tips and all bonds and the reits in the tax advantaged accounts and then hold the most tax efficient equities in the taxable accounts that is the proper answer to the location problem also want to hold volatile equity asset classes in taxable accounts since that increases the value of the tax option loss harvesting foreign holdings in taxable allow you to take the ftc
2736650 there are critics though and i am one of them that think perhaps investors are not quite getting what they expect for a start the holdings in the index funds are market capitalisation weighted this sounds sensible of course except when you consider just how much the biggest companies dominate the portfolio the top one hundred stocks in america representing just 3 of the number of stocks in the index funds actually account for over 60 of the funds invested in vanguards fund
2736651 when you get down to the genuinely small capitalisation stocks there is actually very little money invested in each stock which is why it probably isnt surprising that over long periods of time the wilshire 5000 index performs pretty much the same as the big capitalisation growth stock dominated s amp p500 index
2736652 the art of creating a good portfolio is not about owning everything in market weighted proportions as the total market index does but in having significant exposure to every asset class and rebalancing the portfolio at an appropriate frequency
2736653 so if you want to take advantage of the rebalancing effect you are going to need to have a much larger small cap value exposure in your portfolio than just a couple of percent
2736654 while s amp p 500 index and total market funds make for effective pieces on an investment pie they should only be slices not the whole pie they just dont provide sufficient diversification as stand alone vehicles
2736655 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
2736656 we havent fully recovered from a natural disaster and now were again being battered by a man made calamity
2736657 all peaceful avenues have been exhausted to resolve the conflict
2736658 we are now compelled to resort to the application of proportionate and justifiable force so that peace and order may be restored in north cotabato
2736659 w e export our cuisine and our music but we also export the sons and daughters of louisiana
2736660 the whole trend of losing good people to other states has forced a reckoning
2736661 having a think tank under edwin edwards would have been meaningless
2736662 you could have done a 50 page paper but who would have read it
2736663 we have to be better than our ideological opponents at marketing our ideas
2736664 because we have some pretty tall hills to climb things like a general skepticism among mainstream media
2736665 not to put out a bunch of economic gobbledygook but bring the ivory tower down to earth
2736666 new media promises to create the next revolution that will allow we the people to take back control of our government
2736667 everyone he applies his pen to breathes and the hardness of life shows on their faces and in the slump of their shoulders theyre real people
2736668 i am a stunning young model from poland who loves belfast
2736669 i look forward to meeting you so that you can live your fantasies and allow both of us to have a good time
2736670 there are dangerous people out there but we stay in the hotel because they are usually safe
2736671 if theres a problem with one of the men then i will just scream for help hotels are a lot safer than going to a private address
2736672 i work for myself so why should i want to give anyone else money this is a business and we work hard for our clients
2736673 i wont answer private numbers and i always make sure that i get my clients mobile phone number
2736674 ive never been attacked and i dont want this to happen either this would be bad for me and for any of the other girls
2736675 the police are on to people like me and my friends we are very worried
2736676 but they wont stop the business or keep us away from belfast because business is just so good in this town
2736677 you took up my time so thats why i have charged you
2736678 we have additional security procedures in place to try to prevent this type of activity and restrict non guests gaining access to hotel rooms
2736679 our staff are extremely vigilant and this problem is very rare but should we suspect any activity of this nature we would ask the guest to leave
2736680 we are opposed to the abuse of young women in the sex trade and this is not the type of activity we want to see in hotels
2736681 it is a matter for the hotel about what goes on behind its doors
2736682 this is one of the most spectacular finds in europe
2736683 this find will open up an area of paleontological research in the area
2736684 it is sensational to discover a near complete skeleton like this is unique in romania and a rarity in the world
2736685 it is important because it can give us complete information about the flora and fauna or the era
2736686 until we have conclusive results of the investigation i cant give you a definitive statement
2736687 private contractors routinely operate within the battle space and they provide essential security to a lot of development and stabilization groups
2736688 i dont know whether they had a legitimate target or not theres going to be an investigation into all of this activity
2736689 it would be impossible to achieve what were achieving here
2736690 supposedly they are efficient at what they do but they are also pretty trigger happy
2736691 his best friend describes him as a no nonsense kind of guy who lived like people dreamed he was a fun loving and genuine individual who was totally dedicated to the army and held his section together he looked out for his guys in ways they probably didnt realize
2736692 we are deeply affected by this loss josh will be greatly missed by his military family
2736693 when youre up to your backside in alligators its tough to remember that your original job was to drain the swamp
2736694 another young man dead when will the gods desist from taking those we love theyre all so sorely missed
2736695 when i hear news that another child has passed from earth to a better land sorrows knife returns to twist more deeply too well the loss i understand
2736696 doing its best to ensure a smooth transition to the obama administration
2736697 george bush has done much more for africa than bill clinton ever did
2736698 the current president has called the relationship with china a strategic partnership
2736699 i believe our relationship needs to be redefined as one as competitor
2736700 by re engineering the imf and giving china a bigger voice china will have a greater sense of responsibility for the institutions mission
2736701 i saw maddie i know it was her i saw the unique blemish in her eye
2736702 her eyes met mine as i walked past and thats when i saw the little blemish in her right eye it was like a little fleck
2736703 i wanted to grab her or shout out her name and see what reaction i would get
2736704 but i was afraid to do anything and cause a scene a huge ruckus would have erupted and it could have made things worse
2736705 i decided to get a good look to make sure it was her so i could come back to england and report it
2736706 the investigation team are looking into this seriously the eye makes it potentially more serious than other sightings
2736707 there was lots of light and nothing to obstruct my view
2736708 the door opened and three females with a little girl came in they sat down at a table opposite me about 20 feet away at first i did not take any notice as i was having trouble with my order then i glanced back and noticed the little girl was white with fair hair
2736709 there are sometimes white children in venezuela but not as fair as this child she really stood out i was transfixed
2736710 she was the absolute image of the missing madeleine mccann with chin length straight fair hair about four years old a pretty girl
2736711 what i noticed most prominently were her eyes they were big and staring i shuffled in my seat so i could see madeleine clearly i didnt pay much attention to the three women because i was concentrating on the little girl
2736712 however from what i saw i would say that they were all of spanish south american origin
2736713 female 1 i can describe as being heavily built dark short bobbed hair female 2 had bleached platinum blonde hair with a slim build
2736714 the third had long black hair she was heavily built
2736715 although the girl looked healthy and well cared for she was very sullen looking and refused to eat anything something just didnt fit she looked unhappy and out of place
2736716 the women were talking amongst themselves and at the little girl i couldnt understand they were speaking in spanish
2736717 the little girl wasnt saying anything i watched her for about 20 30 minutes and decided to get a close look as i left the restaurant then i was four to five feet away
2736718 i havent been in england for all of the press coverage and updates about madeleine mccann but i have seen photos of her on the news from what i saw that day i am about 85 per cent certain that it was in fact madeleine mccann
2736719 my dad is a very serious credible and intelligent man hes not the sort of person who would make things up and hed certainly never lie about something like this
2736720 n o tenho medo do povo melhor se submeter ao povo do que a certos interesses internos e externos
2736721 i love the passionate electricity power is such an aphrodisiac
2736722 id love to do a romantic comedy with angelina jolie shes kind of flawless to me
2736723 sometimes i think its harder to be a leading man in a romantic comedy if youre not english
2736724 i think the english do that really really well that sort of slightly camp slightly pathetic thing
2736725 i dont think angelina would want to do a romantic comedy with me though
2736726 im not saying colin firth or hugh grant are pathetic far from it
2736727 i think they are both great but i would like to have a crack at it too
2736728 this combination of a preference for boys and modern technology the ultrasound machine has proven deadly for millions upon millions of baby girls
2736729 sa mos de praticamente toda oss tia do sul como mostra de nossa boa vontade para deter o enfrentamento militar

2736739 three years on and we still dont have any justice for thomas
2736740 we have put our faith in the justice system but it has failed us to date
2736741 what kind of message is this giving to thomas friends and the young people of this new northern ireland
2736742 one man has been charged in relation to the attack on thomas and his friends but this is a very light charge
2736743 the police have worked hard on the investigation and we know they are also unhappy with the pps direction
2736744 the director has agreed to undertake a review of the decision not to prosecute
2736745 the pps has met the family of thomas devlin on a number of occasions over recent months furthermore the pps has written to the family on friday in relation to concerns which they have raised about the decision not to prosecute
2736746 the pps are so cautious in their approach compared to england and this is so frustrating
2736747 the cps will also discuss cases with investigating officers but the pps dont do it and its hard to understand why this is the case
2736748 we have looked at many cases in england including the murder of rhys jones where many people have been charged from murder to assisting offenders and this is the justice that we are seeking
2736749 the cps will charge someone with murder if they are accused of being at the scene but havent pulled the trigger for example why is this joint enterprise policy not used in northern ireland
2736750 the people who murdered my son are still walking the streets and thats why we have formally requested for the pps ruling to be reviewed by an independent qc who has experience of similar cases our request has been noted and we are now just waiting for a response
2736751 three years on and people are still not telling the truth of over thomas murder
2736752 these people have the information that could put my sons killers behind bars but they are still remaining silent
2736753 by remaining silent they are just as culpable as the men who murdered my son
2736754 these people should remember that withholding information is a very serious offence
2736755 we are asking them to search their conscience and come forward because its never to late
2736756 i cant see any earthly reason in this world why he should be remanded to donegal
2736757 i didnt make myself known i just stood at the back of the chapel and paid my respects
2736758 i felt i had to go it was something i just had to do
2736759 we have a leader of the labour party in scotland and in the uk and that leader is gordon brown why do we want to start changing the rule book just because some people believe it needs changed i really dont see any need for creating divides
2736760 i truly appreciate the opportunities that schooltube has allowed my video students at ladue its the real deal and a fabulous resource for our students educational experience
2736761 well y know in the broadest sense of the word
2736762 well i mean the thing was a bit y know and o k ill give you that giant cockroach was a bit of a surprise but thats the kinda thing that keeps you on your toes eh
2736763 here have one of these guaranteed to cheer you up have i ever told you about the beneficial properties of your average nana
2736764 do you realize how close you cut it back there we almost died
2736765 its well its tell you what you pop back in the tardis and ill be back in ten minutes you can pick where we go next
2736766 what do you mean pop back in and wait what is this place why did you bring us here whats so bad that i have to wait here
2736767 its not that its just well i didnt bring us here per se
2736768 believe me i really dont want to be here hanging around with giant cockroaches would be higher up my list of places id want to be but shes right i do need to be here
2736769 this is making even less sense than you usually make
2736770 then its just as well youre staying here isnt it
2736771 i thought we agreed you were waiting in the tardis
2736772 you told me to stay in the tardis i decided that since you have too much hair and not enough spare tire to be my dad i would do what i wanted and i wanted to come with you
2736773 oh i think i do martha jones i think i do
2736774 this is the i c u why are we here
2736775 you wanted to come i told you to wait for me
2736776 doctor smith we were wondering if wed see you today
2736777 im mrs dowd abby are you a colleague of dr smith
2736778 i was just saying i wonder if dr smith will be along today i said hes popped in to see us every day since weve been here didnt i jeff
2736779 i was just saying wasnt i jeff i was just saying we were so lucky to be here so lucky you read so many stories about people coming to places like this and being treat like cattle and worse but dr smith here hes just been
2736780 dr smith can i have a word with you outside
2736781 o k how were you here every day this month when yesterday we were bug wrestling halfway across the galaxy
2736782 yesterday for you and me is not the same as yesterday for them in their time line i was here yesterday have i ever told you about the whole timey
2736783 wimey yes but heres the thing i dont understand if youve been visiting them for a month why is that girl
2736784 dont dont martha me you can do something we can do something
2736785 we can get in the tardis now and go and get her a cure we can go to the future they must have discovered a cure for what shes got
2736786 there must be a cure for it the future or on a different planet i bet the tardis could find it we can do that
2736787 we can the cure is only twenty three years away
2736788 then lets do it we can save that girl we can save lilly i dont know why you havent done it yet if youve been here before but that doesnt matter lets do it now
2736789 i shouldnt have doubted you you were here for the boy not lilly
2736790 i was here for the boy tommy by the way thats his name but its not what you think
2736791 but i saw you i watched you ive seen that before kids like that often get lost and neglected in situations like this the surviving sibling has it hard maybe harder because they have to go on living and they never get the support they need at the time or after i watched you with him you were there for him
2736792 but i wasnt just there for tommy remember i told you a cure is found in twenty three years that cure is discovered by a dr thomas dowd
2736793 oh no no no no hell find it all by himself but he just needed the extra nudge today someone to tell him there was a future someone to tell him that his pain could grow into something better something that would make difference thats why i was here thats why lilly dowd had to die its why ive been watching her die for a month
2736794 but it wasnt a month for you was it you kept coming back and while it was only another day here months could have gone by for you
2736795 come on i need something to drink after today i know this great place that does a mean banana milk shake
2736796 pack up some things ive got a big surprise in store for you
2736797 all i want is a hot bath and to get some sleep
2736798 you can sleep on the way as the drive is rather long as for the bath
2736799 i promise one as soon as we get there i plan on making this a very comfortable and relaxing few days for you with me at your beck and call
2736800 now go back to sleep we should be there in about two hours or so and i want you to be awake enough for your bubble bath tonight
2736801 are you alright john youre positively pale all of a sudden
2736802 im so glad you like it i did a bunch of research online to find it but when i saw it i just knew i wanted to take you here
2736803 you in scotland after nearly ten years you are more tense than usual and i can feel you trembling just slightly even though you are obviously trying to hide it this has got to be really hard for you and while im sure you have your reasons for bringing me here i just want to make sure that youre okay
2736804 its a lot to digest honestly but i really dont want this holiday to be all about me i want to take care of you first and foremost
2736805 can i ask why you brought me here then i mean the gesture is a bit overwhelming in scope but i worry that even though you seem dead set on focusing on me for this visit which you really dont need to do as much as it flatters me by the way you have set yourself up for a very emotional weekend
2736806 i dont know really it just felt like the right time i suppose i keep dreaming of it and i just thought well i dont know what i thought really
2736807 yes quite a lot actually mostly of my old home but also where i used to play as a child with my brother i dont know what it means but there you have it
2736808 you always tell me to not push down things within ourselves as they will only surface that much stronger later on maybe youve been running too long from your old home and your past maybe its time to face it again
2736809 are you alright john youre tossing and turning a lot
2736810 i have a few ideas of how to deal with your tension
2736811 well i did sleep several hours on the way here and i have been asleep on and off since we finished our bath so you neednt worry about that
2736812 i look forward to having that first time with you
2736813 i do tend to prefer the sex ive had in england
2736814 but then that is because im usually in england with you
2736815 you always have the right things to say to a girl on that tongue of yours
2736816 really now why dont you tell me what that preference is
2736817 and i must say sex in scotland with you is just as lovely as ever
2736818 good to know that ive not regressed back into the fumbling teenager i used to be when i was here last
2736819 no perhaps i should send claudia thank you note for that
2736820 of course i must say that i cant wait to make you scream again when we get home being quiet was a wee bit challenging for me i must confess
2736821 i really enjoyed it though john im so happy that you brought me up here
2736822 why am i thinking you might want to leave before dessert
2736823 its too bad as i was really looking forward to the rice pudding with roast mango and mango puree
2736824 i was definitely considering leaving with you as soon as possible but
2736825 then you remembered that good things come to those who wait
2736826 youre going to be in trouble when we get back to the room
2736827 i was thinking of making you wait but seeing as how i need to be inside you immediately ill have to think of another form of punishment
2736828 i dont know that i can hold out much longer
2736829 maybe my punishment will be not waiting for you to come maybe ill just use your body for my own pleasure tonight
2736830 i dont want to just be living out of suitcases at each others flats anymore instead i want rushed mornings where i try to make breakfast for us but burn the bacon or ruin the eggs and we have a good laugh before going out for food instead or even lazy mornings where i surprise you with breakfast in bed or a nice bubble bath
2736831 i want to see you at night curled up on the couch reading a book and wearing some cute flannel pajamas that i know you own but never wear in front of me because you worry i wont find you sexy enough in them i want to come home to you from long stressful nights in the hospital and just curl up in your arms and for you to be able to do the same and i want to look around at everything in my home and just see your presence everywhere as your possessions intermingle with mine your clothes next to mine in the wardrobe your furniture with mine your toothpaste by my sink just all the simple things we can share in a life together
2736832 maybe its too fast i dont know i just know these last six months or so have made me the happiest ive ever been and i well i just want to share all my days and nights with you if you dont want to move in to my flat or me into yours we can move anywhere absolutely anywhere you want ill move anywhere as long as i have you by my side
2736833 i must have just been carried away in the moment wont happen again
2736834 i know that tone and you know i dont like it
2736835 i assumed thats what your silence meant its all right you certainly dont have to consider living with me it was just an idea a fantasy really just forget i ever said anything
2736836 silence is not a rejection i was just surprised i never would have thought that youd consider living with me
2736837 ill understand if its too fast if you dont want to i just
2736838 here i was punishing you tonight but then you went and made me the happiest man alive
2736839 i thought you werent going to try and make me come tonight
2736840 consider this a reward yes cancels things out quite nicely i should think
2736841 between the composite sketch and the photo identification i had messed it up
2736842 by the time i got to the physical lineup ron cotton had become my attacker and that was that
2736843 the majority race is not as good at identifying minorities as it is its own race this is hard wired in some way that we dont completely understand but the phenomenon should be presented to the jury
2736844 this is not an appropriate area for judges to go into
2736845 yes eyewitness id across races has its issues but is there a rampant problem to the degree that we need to get judges to start telling juries this is the law no
2736846 a partir de hoje a maior parte da cidade tskhinvali est controlada pelas for as de paz da r ssia
2736847 comandantes militares tomaram a decis o de retirada de tskhinvali nesta manh
2736848 n s lamentamos as a es perigosas e desproporcionais das for as russas e ficaremos particularmente preocupados se esses ataques continuarem agora que os georgianos est o se retirando
2736849 eu tenho esperan a de que a a o militar ir parar imediatamente e que eles v o se abster em nome da heran a crist em comum de mais combates e viol ncia
2736850 os tanques da ge rgia atiraram contra tudo o que viram incluindo mulheres e crian as
2736851 yes we promised to provide free access to the internet except for a few that would jeopardize our national security and would not be good for the healthy growth of our young people
2736852 as in any other country there are some kinds of limitations
2736853 however i think we are going to provide sufficient access for the media to cover the games
2736854 sites that you need to have for your job its important that you raise them for bocogs awareness
2736855 the censorship situation for those web sites has not loosened at all
2736856 i think an august transfer is still a possibility though kaka will only talk about that when they do a deal
2736857 bella esperienza contro il napoli temo hamsik i napoletani saranno accolti benissimo
2736858 eat lots of bar b que kids and be safe with the fireworks and remember if your shield and bionic arm wont cut it whip out your comments are moderated and will not appear on this weblog until the author has approved them
2736859 to have an unshakable faith we first must be shaken
2736860 when we are shaken by something really big jesus then everything else seems small in comparison
2736861 im going to take a nap and try to get as many calories in me as possible
2736862 thats what im supposed to do with my life nap and eat calories im an olympian
2736863 we havent had any recent contact with real madrid has there been any attempt to heal the rift yeah that will be right
2736864 but the final decision was taken at the end of the season when the first nonsense appeared and cristiano referred to his future being decided in the next few days
2736865 it was decided there and then he was staying there was never any change in our stance
2736866 i think we will just let the thing settle down now
2736867 for the disrespectful maltreatment meted out by brutish airways upon nigerians he promised that the british government would ensure that there is no such repeat by the airline and said
2736868 british airways have sic given us its assurances that they will continue to very much value the nigerian customers and that dignity of nigerian customers is paramount for them on this particular occurrence i say to you that it is an unfortunate incident which we hope will not be repeated
2736869 i saw your truck parked on the road thought you were having truck trouble the next thing i knew you were coming out of the ditch with a stick and a big box
2736870 a new financial power brokers replacing the combined financial muscle of hedge funds and private equity and usurping central banks as the international capital providers of last resort
2736871 a state owned investment fund composed of financial assets such as stocks bonds property or other financial instruments
2736872 if nigeria for example bought into brutish airways through swf the nigerian government would essentially be a stakeholder in brutish airways and thus have a stronger voice in dictating the companys direction in other words that whole incident might never have happened the way it did
2736873 t he consequence of nigeria having a rapidly growing swf means that we can strategically influence key sectors in sovereign economies perhaps buy into other african countries development and have a strong voice in the direction of these economies
2736874 confiscated the stool of a royal father in bayelsa state alleged to be sponsoring sea bandits and also captured seven of the suspected sea pirates
2736875 yes we sent out our fighters to confront the sea pirates when we got information that the boys were robbing fishing trawlers they attack them extort money from them sometimes they disconnect trawlers and carry the whole thing away you see all these things they are doing is spoiling the struggle and people think that it is the mend that is doing it
2736876 our information is that a man who claims to be a royal father is the one that is bankrolling them and we went there to confront them after we got report of what was happening that was after they just robbed a trawler belonging to a company in lagos
2736877 in fact how can you suggest that we should hand them over to the security agents we cannot do that we just hope that after dealing with them they will change and stop robbing people because the struggle is not to rob people we have reasons for blowing up pipelines in the niger delta it is not we are animals sic but the government has turned us to animals and slaves in our own country we have been pushed to the walls and we are telling them enough is enough of the marginalization and oppression
2736878 for possible assistance and collaboration in the development of the power supply infrastructure
2736879 a purposeful and result oriented administration that will yield tangible and visible benefits for all nigerians
2736880 t he world health organization who predicts that the number of smoking related deaths in africa is 100 000 a year but that that figure is set to double in the next 20 years
2736881 a large chunk of the sudanese population can trace at least 50 of their ancestry to nigeria
2736882 is it safe in nigeria what with al qaeda and stuff
2736883 is your mother okay fox news says they just bombed an oil rig
2736884 some americans got kidnapped over there is your family okay
2736885 my family is fine the kidnappers will release the victims in no time dont worry thats how they do things
2736886 the al qaeda network has threatened to send time bombs to nigeria cps commissioners of police of all the commands should be on the alert and ensure that these items bombs do not pass through their end
2736887 solomonsydelle na so we dey i thought we were friends

2736889 hemos dormido en el suelo con los sacos de dormir porque no nos han dado ni noche de hotel ha venido la polic a y nos dijo que la cruz roja igual se pasaba y daba agua pero nada hemos estado tirados aqu aunque hab a gente con ni os
2736890 nosotros tenemos familia por aqu y podemos alojarnos pero hay mucha gente con ni os que no pudieron hacer nada
2736891 the issue you raise is one that millions have probably considered im not sure if a workable answer solution has been derived the only demons that hold sway over nigeria are nigerians themselves no one to blame but us we have had the best opportunities to create a nation that should be a leading example for every human being but we have failed can we overcome this failure absolutely failure is simply an opportunity to revise the game plan and attack the problem s with a better and successful strategy why havent we achieved this success for the very reason you referred to with the quote those who benefit from the status quo will protect it with everything they have that is basically the way of the world and it is not a new phenomenon the issue in my opinion becomes when will the average nigerian realize that they as a collection of individuals and interests can demand and work towards change that will benefit everyone and not just those that already are advantaged by the current status quo i pray that that time will come sooner rather than later because the nigeria that i know and the nigeria i take pains to study does not have time to wait for the government to make changes from the top to the bottom nigeria needs a bottom up strategy that will likely be organic it needs minds and psychology to change in order to have a populace that engages in democracy and the decisions that will transform the country
2736892 there is no gainsaying the fact that the good people of nigeria are righteously indignant of the epileptic state of power supply in the country and from that pedestal it becomes germane for them to expect some kind of urgent solutions to this incubus and i am in perfect agreement with my countrymen
2736893 t hree governors who also served as ministers of power in the past
2736894 i now know that yes yaradua needs agagu and imoke to support his new power scheme
2736895 there is a total loss of confidence between shell and the ogoni people
2736896 another operator acceptable to the ogonis will take over nobody is gaining from the conflict and stalemate so this is the best solution
2736897 a bold step that stands the brightest chance of quickening the resumption of oil activities in ogoni
2736898 it is not true that he looted public treasury i knew who abacha was because i was close to him
2736899 returned all monies stolen by former head of state late general sani abacha to nigeria without any conditions as to how the monies should be spent
2736900 concentrate on making their contributions to our national development instead of wasting time and public funds in investing past administrations
2736901 in politics there are no known friends or foes only interests which constantly change
2736902 my goal was to give myself and others a way to express their disappointment and frustrations over the recent nigerian electoral process and the state of nigerian affairs in general
2736903 you find even in personal dealings business dealings in the market place between individuals there is no respect for decent dealings that are governed by civilised behaviour respect for the rule of law is the basis for civilisation
2736904 later on you and your countrymen may have to refine it and be more focused so that its interpretation will not be very confusing nor conflicted
2736905 y are we still in our present situation if not worse
2736906 demand that a proper account be given for every government fund and policies sic by the past government
2736907 you are not unaware of the lawlessness if not outright anarchy that preceded the present administration the records of abuse of power through unlawful arrests and detentions unjust and unwarranted impeachments that were upturned by the supreme court flagrant disobedience of court orders and many other violation of the principles of the rule of law by individuals corporate organisations and government agencies in the countrys past are still fresh in our memories
2736908 nobody is above the law and so anybody who runs foul of the law will not be spared no matter how highly placed
2736909 not waste their time repairing any lines as they will continue to sabotage them
2736910 it is unfortunate that angola a new entrant into the organisation of petroleum exporting countries opec has over taken the country in crude oil production as a result of
2736911 oil is the lifeblood of nigeria upon which almost everything else depends and until the nation
2736912 peaceful mediation with armed groups such as mend is needed
2736913 the under secretary general for political affairs at the united nations un prof ibrahim agboola gambari has urged the federal government to consider devoting an equivalent of 50 per cent of oil revenue for 30 days to the development of the niger delta region in order to address the most basic needs of the region
2736914 taking money from relatives who live abroad and instead of using that money on an assigned task they usurp that money for their own private use
2736915 the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing
2736916 as far as i can tell most africans dont have crazy levels of ambition once they have enough they will be content
2736917 suspected gunmen kidnapped and later killed the permanent secretary in the office of the secretary to the state government dr ekparipa apiri
2736918 when i pass what i want people to say is but he was just here
2736919 death is more universal than life everyone dies but not everyone lives
2736920 they have not been here for long and they just kept themselves to themselves
2736921 in many ways these species are the power plants and lungs of the ecosystems
2736922 i dont know if anything compares to it anywhere in the world

2736924 and what does the park need to do to protect them now and in the future
2736925 a lot of scientists want so badly to be involved that they donate a lot of their time
2736926 we keep finding things in places that we thought we knew

2736928 four of them will be charged with fishing untagged lobster traps and one will be charged with fishing during a closed time

2736939 the doctors discovered a hole in his lung yesterday saturday
2736940 the air seeps out into the skin and gets trapped he had to lay in bed for two days he did the best he could
2736941 i felt sluggish and he georgiev took advantage of that
2736942 i felt i was too slow by the time i was in he was out and he counter punched
2736943 its crappy to go out but it was good to experience this
2736944 im really happy with the way the first four races went and hopefully i can keep it going
2736945 its a really long regatta and theres a lot more racing left so hopefully i can just stay consistent and not have any big scores
2736946 i definitely just want to continue finishing in the top of the fleet i think that if you can just be in the top 10 you can put yourself into a good position
2736947 it feels great to be leading at the olympic games but you cant focus on one person though
2736948 ben is having a really good regatta as well he has two firsts and a fourth and he just got a bit unlucky in the first series
2736949 hes been on form hes sailing really well and its a long event so ill just keep concentrating on myself and keep doing what im doing and hopefully keep putting good results up
2736950 i tried everything that i could and i stayed to the left of him which i thought was the favorite side on the downwind but he just sailed a little better than i did down towards the finish and got by me and won the race
2736951 our accuracy was affected by the rain while converting penalty corners
2736952 we are totally satisfied but in saying that we knew that we had to bring our best game
2736953 proyecto 1 pues finalizais la tarea del que veais con esto el virus ya no estar operativo pero a n lo tendreis en el ordenador

2736955 it is a phenomenal way to assure you always have income
2736956 in this environment the only programs that i see as safe are football and mens and womens basketball
2736957 wed all be naive if we didnt feel better every time we got a scholarship endowed
2736958 were in a little bit of survival mode right now
2736959 people are starting to realize if you endow a program it means it wont disappear
2736960 the realization that we all have to invest in the future of things that are special to us is hitting home
2736961 rather than having the little ones we have wed like to combine them and have them grow faster
2736962 hopefully if you are proactive youll never get to that point
2736963 there is a constant pull for dollars and what you can spend today versus the dollars you can invest for the future paying for today wins out in a lot of cases and it can be hard when you have this big endowment fund but you cant touch it but that is the attraction that it is going to be there forever and ever

2736965 comparing blood pressure in the ankle and the arm could give doctors a quick way to know which patients are at higher risk of cardiovascular disease researchers say
2736966 the measure known as the ankle brachial index could help address a serious public health challenge determining who is at risk of heart attack and stroke
2736967 the problems often occur in patients with no known history of cardiovascular problems and current approaches to figure out who is at risk which look at things like smoking blood pressure and cholesterol give mixed results
2736968 four organizations with very different missions and visions have come together to form a partnership this partnership aims to start a campaign that will spread like wildfire to encourage people to switch from incandescent bulbs to cfls
2736969 in this day and age a change in lifestyle is called for
2736970 a very few people grasped the concept of high energy that hurts the pocket and hurts the earth
2736971 even when i am in bed my thoughts rush to you my eternally beloved now and then joyfully then again sadly waiting to know whether fate will hear our prayer to face life i must live altogether with you or never see you yes i am resolved to be a wanderer abroad until i can fly to your arms and say that i have found my true home with you and enfolded in your arms can let my soul be wafted to the realm of blessed spirits alas unfortunately it must be so you will become composed the more so you know that i am faithful to you no other woman can ever possess my heart never never oh god why must one be separated form her who is so dear yet my life in v ienna at present is a miserable life your love has made me both the happiest and the unhappiest of mortals at my age i now need stability and regularity in my life can this coexist with our relationship angel i have just heard that the post goes every day and therefore i must close so that you may receive the letter immediately be calm for only by calmly considering our lives can we achieve our purpose to live together be calm love me today yesterday what tearful longing for you for you you my life my all all good wishes to you oh do continue to love me never misjudge your lovers most faithful heart ever yours ever mine ever ours
2736972 anything less than mad passionate extraordinary love is a waste of time
2736973 a father his son and a friend of his son were sailing off the pacific coast
2736974 when a fast approaching storm blocked any attempt to get back to the shore the waves were so high that even though the father was an experienced sailor he could not keep the boat upright and the three were swept into the ocean as the boat capsized
2736975 knew his son would step into eternity with jesus and he could not bear the thought of his sons friend stepping into an eternity without jesus
2736976 it sure isnt very realistic is it but im standing here today to tell you that story gives me a glimpse of what it must have been like for god to give up his son for me you see i was that father and your pastor is my sons friend
2736977 skotties work like that of katie cooks impresses me because of the obvious fun that he has while drawing its in everything he does
2736978 perhaps if he had taken a look around once in a while at all the good people who were helping him up he might have realized that he didnt get where he was all alone then perhaps he wouldnt have felt so much like superman
2736979 a resident in the south blount utility district said they got a notice of violation of safe drinking water standards indicating their drinking water was contaminated with high levels of lead
2736980 it was a touching moment and a lovely display of republican family values cindy blushed of course and looked flattered you could almost see her already measuring the thongs she will wear in the white house
2736981 the very sad thing is there are people that one wouldnt readily categorize as being racist in any other situation that do feel that obama being president would
2736982 one thing about davis he has consistently blamed democrats for all the national and regional ills and now he blames them for not being re elected
2736983 taking a stand against chinas big redemptive pr show by declining to attend wouldve been consistent and coherent but complaining all the way to the show and even at his reception in china this morning smacks of incoherency bad manners and outright hypocrisy
2736984 katie allison granju signed off for the last time at knoxville talks yesterday she did a fantastic job creating a great new local media sponsored blog and set the bar high for her successor

2736990 once again the gop leadership sided with oil profiteers and used their power to help keep oil prices and profits high while hurting the average american
2736991 if passion alone won elections it would be a landslide for tuke this fall should he get the nomination

2736996 thank heavens the white kids in nashvilles public schools are doing so well academically if they werent our schools would look much worse
2736997 the piece discusses the increased interest in bicycling that has accompanied higher gasoline prices i have noticed more people riding on the roads this summer unfortunately a few of them appear to have not yet mastered safety rules on riding with traffic
2736998 i have trouble understanding the separation between the roane alliance a county government function supported by our tax dollars and the chamber of commerce
2736999 todays message is simple all the gobs have to do is wait long enough and the voters of this county will forget whatever transgressions may have angered them in the past
2737000 to shield itself from public accountability the white house crafted rules which ignored centuries of legal precedent and tossed aside even the barest semblance of justice in favor of a system automatically tilted toward the prosecution
2737001 also please ask whomever is your choice for president why he bought 5 6 million dollars in advertising during the olympics knowing what china is doing in darfur tibet berma and other human and animal rights violations
2737002 of course the malkin tents are going to claim another victory but hey look at it this way we liberals can snicker at them for defending a holiday with communist socialist origins founded by the evil labor unions
2737003 here in nashville i saw 3 69 at a pilot station earlier this week thats a 40 cent drop from the high of 4 09 gallon back in july funny none of the stories about that republican kabuki theater on offshore oil drilling bothers to mention that
2737004 forty five percent of volunteering in tennessean is performed in the religious sector whereas that number is 63 in utah are tennesseans heathens or is that just a mormon thing
2737005 this this i believe explains the virulent anti mexican sentiment here in the south

2737009 regardless of intent the regulation certainly could functionally allow the defining of contraceptives as abortion
2737010 with no exercise you can take a drug and chemically mimic it
2737011 honestly i just dont know how that happens whether it would happen in a person i dont know i think its a small miracle it happened at all
2737012 it would be better to do exercise than to take a pill
2737013 government should place few if any restrictions on scientific research and development
2737014 this decision is a stunning disregard for religious liberty and first amendment freedoms of people of faith of christians and those who believe in traditional marriage defined as one man and one woman
2737015 this shows the very disconcerting authoritarian face of the homosexual activists who are using these non discrimination laws as weapons against christians in the business world and christians in their churches
2737016 there is a great threat to our religious liberties and our ability to speak out in favor of traditional marriage when these non discrimination laws are interpreted in such a harsh way to censor christians and others

2737041 but unlike kate and gerry i was only trying to report a burglary not the theft of my child
2737042 one of the things obvious to anyone dealing with the police on the algarve is the sorry fact that no matter what you have lost there simply isnt enough of them to begin tracking it down
2737043 that may be one of the worst twists of fate in what happened to madeleine that tragically she went missing in the wrong place
2737044 eamonn was looking forward to his holiday and cant believe this has happened to him
2737045 the only reason he brought so much cash is because he didnt want to use his credit card every time the kids needed some money
2737046 hes not very happy because he was staying a top quality hotel and his family could quite easily
2737047 police are investigating a burglary in the villa moura area and enquiries are continuing
2737048 we never expected anything like this to happen it was awful
2737049 not only was our dream holiday ruined but this man made off with valuables which were of sentimental value

2737051 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2737052 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2737053 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2737054 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2737111 upon information that was communicated to me by my criminal attorney the father of mr harris was agreeable with this arrangement but it took some convincing for the mother to agree she finally agreed and i was sentenced to two years under the non adjudication statute to probation

2737203 the sa government is developing options for long term solutions to the issues on the lower lakes
2737204 they received 200 million at the coag council of australian governments meeting last month for this purpose

2737206 the issue of intellectual capital was a furphy the main issue for us is that hydro tasmania will not sign this particular mou because the proposal lacks the detail to even warrant further consideration
2737207 given the decision of the tasmanian authorities not to proceed with the mainland pipeline option to free up gippsland water for the murray goulburn basin has the victorian government considered a flood diversion from the aberfeldy river to the thomson river which could free up water for flushing the lower murray via a 30 kilometre tunnel from the upper yarra reservoir to the eildon
2737208 the aberfeldy diversion tunnel was surveyed in 1975 but abandoned when the thomson filled up quickly and it appeared that additional water was not needed
2737209 recent estimates have put the cost at no more than 40 million
2737210 depending on the size of the tunnel and the flood it could divert up to 500 gigalitres into the basin in summer when it is most needed

2737286 our intelligence had reported that two vatican agents have come to our terran neighborhood blagoevgrad
2737287 we have observed their activity so far they didnt show any suspicious activity around blagoevgrad but there was information that after abel nightroads arrival many methuselah agents who had been assigned previously to investigate the issue have disappeared mysteriously entering that city our intelligence has strong indication that this could somehow relate to the arrival of abel nightroad he might post some secret weapon there with the help from his assistant karin moravia we are still lacking of information of what kind of secret weapon the vatican have posted your task is to seized their secret weapon after you get the weapon you have to assassin both vatican agents immediately you will be provided with any facilities you needed any question
2737288 i saw those towers fall and ive seen an implosion in las vegas theres too much similarities between the two and i saw a building fall that didnt get hit by nothing

2737299 bagus sekali pemandangannya ioan walaupun gelap tapi bagus pemandangan bulan purnama itu aneh ya walau gelap tapi kelihatan semuanya ngomong ngomong dari mana kamu dapat spot seperti ini
2737300 sudah lama aku tahu tempat ini tapi tak terpikir olehku untuk berlama lama di sini setelah aku ketemu kamu aku berpikir bagus juga kalau membawamu ke sini dulu keadaannya sangat parah lalu aku bersihkan sedikit lantainya tempat duduk ini supaya waktu kamu datang ia jadi sudah bagus dan bersih
2737301 tempatnya bagus sih cuman kalau terran pasti males ke tempat seperti ini
2737302 di tempat manapun juga kalau bersama kamu pasti suasananya jadi bagus
2737303 ioan bisa nggak sih kalau kita menyalakan api aku kedinginan soalnya
2737304 kamu nggak bisa ya kupikir semua vampir punya keahlian menyalakan api lalu keahlianmu apa
2737305 mau tau ya aku belum pernah kasih tahu kamu soalnya aku punya keahlian menggerakkan benda dan mengubahnya jadi partikel partikel mikro hmm mungkin bisa dibilang gabungan telekinesis dan simulasi gelombang microwave seperti itu
2737306 kalau lagi pacaran gini ngga bisa buat menghangatkan badan dong
2737307 jaga jaga dari apa bukannya ada ioan almighty di sini yang jagain kamu

2737351 youre sure i couldnt even go down there even for just a few minutes it surely wont bother anyone
2737352 no if i let you go then other photographers will follow
2737353 but there are only 8 of us here today its nearly empty surely this wont be a problem
2737354 but you might get in the way of someone and we cannot let this happen
2737355 what if i promise to move if i get in anyones way and to move if you ask me to for any reason whatsoever

2737365 the unplanned redeployment of georgian forces will have some impact in the near term however as with any change in force structure we will make adjustments to ensure sustainment of coalition operations
2737366 we do not anticipate their departure will result in a significant long term impact on the overall security situation in iraq
2737367 they want to go home as soon as possible and help
2737368 we have the same situation in our home as here though the territory is different we have no desert

2737380 at the end of the day we were very close to war
2737381 these are not two different things because its not amputating hand its amputating head or heart no georgian president could survive if he gave up on abkhazia
2737382 if the international community by its inaction will not leave any other option for georgia then we have to make decision
2737383 a quest for a reliable strategic partner with america being the preferred choice
2737384 their grand ambition is to undo the post cold war settlement and to re establish russia as a dominant power in eurasia
2737385 anything we can do to weaken the u s is good for russia
2737386 we may not hes got priorities and needs to take care of those things
2737387 obviously hearing the news was tragic stunning words cant describe it
2737388 you know what ive got this happening here right now but we need to complete what we started out here
2737389 our knee jerk reaction was we were angry we were upset and we wanted to talk to our friends and family

2737406 this dish is a different take on the original http news
2737407 we did it at the hands of sheriffs deputies who burst through our front door rifles blazing
2737408 why dont you tie a kerosene soaked rag around your ankles so the ants wont climb up and eat your candy ass
2737409 it was literally resistant to every meaningful antibiotic that we had
2737410 so we had this report and i looked at it and said to myself my god this is an organism that basically we cant treat
2737411 they were very effectively moving the organism from one bed to the next
2737412 is that you take a capable micro rganism like klebsiella and you put it through the gruelling test of being exposed to a broad spectrum of antibiotics and it will eventually defeat your efforts as this one did
2737413 virtually all cases of mrsa were either in hospitals or nursing homes in the hospital setting they cause wound infections after surgery pneumonias and bloodstream infections from indwelling catheters but they can cause a variety of other infections all the way to bacterial meningitis
2737414 and then it started showing up in men who have sex with men
2737415 soon it began to be spread in prisons among the prisoners now we see it in a whole bunch of other populations
2737416 there are about a dozen new antibiotics coming on the market in the next couple of years
2737417 but there are no good drugs coming along for these gram negatives
2737418 the klebsiella that caused particular trouble in new york are spreading out
2737419 they have very high mortality rates they are sort of the doomsday scenario bugs
2737420 i was really interested to see whether we could find an antibiotic resistant population of bacteria in a place that had never seen antibiotics
2737421 they were at the time thought to be drugs of last resort because they had activity against a whole variety of multiply resistant gram negative bacteria that were already floating around
2737422 its a big problem and its contaminated the evacuation facilities in germany and a lot of the v a hospitals in the united states where these soldiers have been brought
2737423 seventy per cent of the antibiotics administered in america end up in agriculture
2737424 the drugs are not used to cure sick animals but to prevent them from getting sick because we crowd them together under filthy circumstances these are perfect environments for disease and we also have found for reasons that i dont think we entirely understand that administering low levels of antibiotics to animals speeds their growth
2737425 believes that prudent drug use principles are essential to the control of antimicrobial resistance
2737426 antibiotics and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb are found in the air and soil around farms in surface and ground water in wild animal populations and on retail meat and poultry arb are carried into the kitchen on contaminated meat and poultry where other foods are cross contaminated because of common unsafe handling practices
2737427 the problem is that we have created the perfect environment in which to breed superbugs that are antibiotic resistant
2737428 weve created a petri dish in our factory farms for the evolution of dangerous pathogens
2737429 bad bugs no drugs as antibiotic discovery stagnates a public health crisis brews
2737430 most people would say that efflux is the most common form of bacterial resistance to antibiotics
2737431 this has been a problem in mediterranean europe that started about ten years ago
2737432 it started to get really serious during the last five or six years and has become really dramatic in greece
2737433 there are now a growing number of reports of cases of infections caused by gram negative organisms for which no adequate therapeutic options exist
2737434 this return to the preantibiotic era has become a reality in many parts of the world
2737435 anytime you hear about some kid getting snatched you want to find something in that story that will convince you that that family is different from yours
2737436 but the problem is that any of us could be an i c u patient tomorrow its not easy to convey this to people if its not immediately a threat you dont want to think about it but its actually anybody who goes into a hospital this is scary stuff
2737437 they developed a huge number of important anti microbial agents they had incredible chemistry and incredible research facilities and unfortunately they have completely pulled out of it now after squibb merged with bristol myers they closed their antibacterial program
2737438 fda approval of new antibacterial agents decreased by 56 per cent over the past 20 years 1998 2002 vs 1983 1987
2737439 antibiotics are the only class of drugs where all the experts as soon as you introduce them clinically we go out and tell everyone to try to hold it in reserve
2737440 if there is a new cardiology drug every cardiologist out there is saying that everyone deserves to be on it
2737441 the big picture did not receive the attention it deserved
2737442 as loud as my voice might be there are louder voices screaming
2737443 the difficulty that we are faced with is that our budget has been flat for the last five years
2737444 in real dollars weve lost almost fifteen per cent purchasing power
2737445 the problem is it is extremely difficult to do a prospective controlled trial because when people come into the hospital they immediately get started on some treatment which ruins the period of study
2737446 the culture of american medicine makes a study like that more difficult to execute
2737447 of course its only around ten million people so its possible to intervene because everything is smaller
2737448 maybe swedes are more used to this type of intervention and regulation
2737449 you are probably going to have to screen millions of compounds and you cant screen millions of infected mice
2737450 so our approach was to find an alternative host that could be infected with human pathogens which was small enough and cheap enough to be used in drug screens whats remarkable is that many common human pathogens including staphylococcus and pseudomonas will cause intestinal infection and kill the worms so now you can look for a compound that cures it that prevents the pathogen from killing the host
2737451 bacteria dont want to alert their host that they are there by immediately producing virulence factors which the host would recognize
2737452 when they reach a certain quorum there are too many of them for the host to do anything about it
2737453 its a great idea but so far nobody has been able to make it work for human infections
2737454 as his new team members the new doctors join foreman who after getting fired from a new job at a different hospital is rehired by cuddy back to houses team in the middle of the contest
2737455 this seems a lot like the oh so awesome show
2737456 between the composite sketch and the photo identification i had messed it up
2737457 by the time i got to the physical lineup ron cotton had become my attacker and that was that
2737458 the majority race is not as good at identifying minorities as it is its own race this is hard wired in some way that we dont completely understand but the phenomenon should be presented to the jury
2737459 this is not an appropriate area for judges to go into
2737460 yes eyewitness id across races has its issues but is there a rampant problem to the degree that we need to get judges to start telling juries this is the law no
2737461 for example the wind industry it was nothing in the 1970s today one third of all terrestrial wind turbines in the world come from denmark
2737462 we got 99 percent of our energy from the middle east today it is zero
2737463 i have observed that in all other countries including in america people are complaining about how prices of gasoline are going up
2737464 the cure is not to reduce the price but on the contrary to raise it even higher to break our addiction to oil we are going to introduce a new tax reform in the direction of even higher taxation on energy and the revenue generated on that will be used to cut taxes on personal income so we will improve incentives to work and improve incentives to save energy and develop renewable energy
2737465 everybody was fighting for himself and i still do not understand why everybody were leaving each other
2737466 leads you to believe you can do whatever you want youre invincible and therell be no consequences
2737467 when you look into a mirror do you like whats looking at you now that youve seen your true reflections what on earth are you gonna do
2737468 you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare
2737469 yeah i didnt think anyone would ever know about it i didnt
2737470 one of the most important lessons of the wars in iraq and afghanistan is that military success is not sufficient to win
2737471 it simply does not have the built in domestic constituency of defense programs
2737472 as an example the f 22 aircraft is produced by companies in 44 states thats 88 senators
2737473 military force usually has the opposite effect from what is intended
2737474 we need to believe in the power of american diplomacy and we should not believe a military conflict with iran is inevitable
2737475 our first impulse should be a serious and patient and persistent diplomatic effort too often in our national debate we focus on the military option and give short shrift to the diplomatic option
2737476 que la verdad est muy bueno la canci n aunque calmadita es muy amena de escuchar y no s lo tiene a cantantes que en china los han de reconocer de volada yo sinceramente nada m s reconoc a
2737477 you wouldnt see me in a suit thats masculine everything you see me in it has to have a slow curve or unusual cut at the bottom or unusual cut at the neck not just a simple style there has to be something a little different i like bcbg max azria
2737478 i left romania 18 years ago i was having everything handmade then now i still have it but now its the daughter not the original seamstress she doesnt even know me she knows my measurements usually once a year i get a shipment of 10 to 15 outfits in fact i just came back from romania with them probably 70 percent were dresses and 30 percent separates i usually go more for skirts than pants
2737479 people at work know me for my 4 inch heels if im in flats they ask me whats wrong i always make a statement because of the white coat it does make the shoes more important the white coat makes everyone look the same so you have to make a statement
2737480 i never shop for shoes because i need them ill go into a shoe store and if i see something i like i buy it even if i dont have an outfit they go with ill go find one i pick whatever is different if its boring its not my shoe if its crystal or a gold heel its mine if it has a different texture like fur its mine theyre all sleek pointed toe all different colors i have just one pair of platforms
2737481 if the shoes are a statement then the dress is just one color and a very simple line the accent is only on one item either the dress or the shoes i dont really accessorize im not good at it so i decided to stay away from accessories
2737482 i know things are tough how are you be in touch when you can
2737483 glad that the avatar of donne as an intermediate power between spenser and milton was so brief and partial
2737484 the representation of your chosen embodied appearance to other people in a virtual world
2737485 because back then pre internet you had to call a number with your telephone and then set it back into the cradle you were reaching out into this game quite literally through a silver strand the avatar was the incarnation of a deity the player in the online world we liked the idea of the puppet master controlling his puppet but instead of using strings he was using a telephone line
2737486 once a human being enters habitat he or she takes on the visual form of an avatar and for all intents and purposes becomes one of these new world beings
2737487 and both a swedish death metal band and a professional wrestler have adopted the moniker
2737488 its absolutely my intention to never be out this year and i am even more determined now to consistently outscore extras todays performance was a disappointment in that respect
2737489 yeah yeah mmmmnn bloody lucky that one stuck cause i was starting to lactate after a couple of dubious efforts in the field
2737490 look the treasurer is a good bloke he keeps a fine wicket and i want catches taken but if they are dropped i am more than comfortable with dealing with guus
2737491 this is my year and i am dedicated to the team if it comes to it i will catch two or three busses just to be here i would even spend 13 hours travelling from st kilda to kings cross if it came to it
2737492 im not owning up to that it was windy the ball was high and frankly i am a mexican the only catching i like doing is catching some shut eye under a tree
2737493 i like hernandez he is a valuable contribution to the ravens
2737494 i mean its smokers like guus noodles and juan carlos who keep me interested in games like today the macarthur were shit

2737585 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2737586 ai ku kad aurelijus meluoja man pati alina pasakojo kod l mane i met tikina muzikantas grup je grojau tik i id jos man net juokinga pasakyti kiek u tai gaudavau visiems muzikantams ten moka
2737587 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2737588 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2737589 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2737590 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2737591 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2737592 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2737593 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2737594 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2737595 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2737596 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2737597 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2737598 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2737599 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2737600 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2737601 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2737602 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2737603 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2737604 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2737605 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2737606 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2737607 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2737608 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2737609 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2737610 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2737611 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2737612 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2737613 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2737614 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2737615 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2737616 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2737617 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2737618 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2737619 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2737620 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2737621 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2737622 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2737623 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2737624 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2737625 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2737626 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2737627 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2737628 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2737629 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2737630 the australian classification website has just updated with a whopper of a scoop r type dimensions is coming to the xbox live arcade
2737631 crunchtime games have been working on their xbox live arcade title shred nebula for quite some time now

2737633 while socom confrontation got its release date a week or two ago the prices were still up in the air but now kotaku has now been able to confirm that the psn download version of the game will cost 39 99us
2737634 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2737635 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2737636 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2737637 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2737638 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2737639 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2737640 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2737641 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2737642 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2737643 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2737644 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2737645 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2737646 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2737647 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2737648 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2737649 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2737650 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2737651 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2737652 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2737653 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2737654 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2737655 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2737656 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2737657 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2737658 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2737659 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2737660 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2737661 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2737662 i usually avoid broadway at all costs when im feeling the need to party sip bar amp lounge totally changed that for me

2737667 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2737668 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2737669 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2737670 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2737671 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2737672 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2737673 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2737674 who are open to doing something on the production side
2737675 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2737676 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2737677 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2737678 i think they can buff that right out i used to do this type of work i dont think we need to paint at all

2737685 it was only once we started talking about the idea that it sank in how many singles theres been from what about me right through to loud and in pieces all these songs mean so much to me and showcase a journey that ive been through with my songwriting and recording my career in general its great to have the new songs on the album as they are just a taste of what weve got planned for next year
2737686 there are more eyes looking over apple products for vulnerabilities
2737687 it has slowly been growing as a target people are more and more interested in
2737688 there are a lot more people getting into it and really getting their hands dirty
2737689 ive been seeing a lot of reverse engineering on the apple platform
2737690 windows developers take their code and make it work on apple
2737691 they could take potential vulnerabilities with them or possibly create new ones because they are working on an entirely different platform
2737692 it shows people are getting proficient at analyzing apple software
2737693 there are people looking at the iphone we pass vulnerabilities on to vendors and when i communicate with apple the first thing they ask is if weve tested it on the iphone they dont want to be surprised
2737694 they told me that i was a hero and that they wished they could do the same in their countries
2737695 its very difficult to provide services to men who have sex with men in countries that dont acknowledge they exist or criminalize them if they do exist
2737696 to follow mexicos bold example and pass laws against homophobia
2737697 its a virus so you need to put the money where the virus is
2737698 these men believed they were not at risk because they were not having sex with sex workers or women which is what the campaign focused on
2737699 that scenario is being played out across the developing world
2737700 instead of saying they are gay its easier for them to justify their behavior they say they were drunk and they were really sexually excited and willing to have sex with whomever
2737701 in iran we dont have homosexuals like in your country
2737702 this means that we are not moving ahead with the fight against aids
2737703 totally panicked because until now they believed these men did not exist
2737704 i tell them to say things like there are many cultures where men are very close to men
2737705 if anyone asks a man that he will slap you
2737706 im pleased to announce the book that we are gathered here this evening to bring into the world of print has been selected as a textbook for use in literature courses by most of the colleges and universities in this great country of ours
2737707 this book is an insightful and very learned and thorough survey of american literature in the twentieth century
2737708 volaire trombley analyzes the literature and explains how the various authors influenced and impacted others
2737709 she covers all the major authors and most of the minor ones in the world of literature
2737710 she has made this her life work and it shows in her thorough understanding of the topic
2737711 first of all i would like to thank you thank all of you
2737712 no one knows better than you all of you the co operative nature of a book an author writes a book but its the editors the proof readers the index compilers the printers and all the others who bring a bok to life and to the greater public
2737713 i regret that my daughter tyler harriman cannot be here for this advent she has a marvelous book out that has come out to great reviews and is selling well i urge you all to buy and read her book the journey of canary
2737714 tyler is performing this evening dancing and has asked me to give her regards to all of you
2737715 you seem to have covered everyone in your book but you made little mention of herman woulk
2737716 but i do mention him i write about his well written and most authentic novel inside outside
2737717 but he is jewish and he gives meaning understanding and depth to what it means to be jewish
2737718 but i always thought winds of war and war and remembrance were his best books and you dont mention them at all
2737719 i think those two books are very derivative she thinks of a harsher nastier word but decides not to use it
2737720 upton sinclair wrote an eleven book series using the same plot and theme fifty years before woulk wrote those two books
2737721 sinclair did a more thorough job of research and a better job of writing than woulk
2737722 woulk went so far as to use interviews with roosevelt for his character just as sinclair did
2737723 i couldnt be kind to these two books because i had read them before and they are a pale rendition of sinclair
2737724 is a very influential woman that is the wife of herman woulk and shes worked in the publishing industry for decades
2737725 shes a cunt but i wouldnt take her too seriously
2737726 im so stupid i cant believe it ive just inserted both my feet halfway down my throat i didnt just put them in my mouth i had to gag over them
2737727 why cant i learn to keep my opinions to myself why do i have to open my big mouth why do i have to ruin everything
2737728 yes and youre going to relax youre going let whats bothering you slip away slide off you and leave youre going to totally enjoy this evening smiling and talking with everyone receiving all the praise and adulation that you rightly deserve
2737729 its not that bad im an independent agent its not like i work for one of the big insurance companies
2737730 i just believe in the constitution there is no argument that you can make based on the constitution that would allow any legislature to pass such a law ive heard a very good argument made that driving is a right and not a privilege as is currently held
2737731 i didnt attend harvard probably the best know law school in the country and one that isnt accredited
2737732 thank you so much for the ride and the interesting conversation
2737733 despite an image of decline more people today in more places read the content produced in the newsrooms of american daily newspapers than at any time in years
2737734 money you dont need can only buy things you dont need
2737735 the idea of it being completely absent from the most important exams of your childhood is disgraceful
2737736 i used to write for small orchestras when i was 15
2737737 if you dont learn to read music then theres a whole tradition that becomes very exclusive and shouldnt be
2737738 it depends what you believe a secondary school musical education is for
2737739 if its about accessing the western classical tradition then of course you need to learn staff notation
2737740 just because a musical tradition is transmitted through staff notation does not mean that it is superior you only have to spend half an hour with good indian musicians to appreciate that
2737741 where i think damon albarn is right is that if you think you are ever going to need to use staff notation you need to learn it young like every other kind of musical skill
2737742 i am not a musician i dont go in too deep if you have the music in your head and you sing it with your body then youll be all right
2737743 i dont read music i dont write i dont play all i can do is tell you how it goes like dumdum dum dumde dum
2737744 it seems like such a long time ago that i was this freshman who was so nervous every time i got down into the blocks
2737745 ive done a lot of growing up these last four years i knew i had the confidence to win the ncaa title regardless of who was lined up next to me im definitely a more confident sprinter now than ive been at any other point in my career
2737746 i dont think theres any question that we took a chance when we signed richard four years ago but its something that has certainly paid off for both richard and lsu
2737747 this was a guy who came to us with a few tools to work with and we felt he might be able to slowly develop into a solid contributor at the sec and ncaa level
2737748 i dont think anybody including richard could have imagined that he would reach this level of performance in four years its remarkable
2737749 i always felt like i had to prove to everyone that i was worthy of being here you could probably say i was a little insecure in the beginning
2737750 its kind of funny looking back on it now but im sure coach shaver was probably thinking to himself you know why did we sign this guy i just wasnt very good my first year and i think my insecurity was a big reason why
2737751 i speak to some of the coaches now from the other schools that i tried to contact about recruiting me and they openly say they regret not taking me i bet they do
2737752 its a great feeling to be able to call myself an olympian
2737753 its something ive wanted to do ever since i was a youngster looking at some of the great guys in history like hasley crawford and ato boldon in my own country i always told myself that i wanted to be like them
2737754 it didnt even seem like it was a reality four years ago but things really worked out well for me here at lsu and its just great that i will have the experience of running in the olympic games
2737755 realistically the gold and silver medals look pretty solid with usain bolt and asafa powell but the bronze medal it seems like is really up in the air with tyson gay having gotten hurt at the trials
2737756 im pretty confident that richard can run right at his personal best or a little bit faster and thats what its going to take to make the final and possibly medal
2737757 its great to know that im going into the olympics for the first time with a legitimate shot to get something done there
2737758 a lot of people go to their first olympic games and theyre just happy and content with being able to compete ill be really honest if i go there and i dont get into the final then ill be extremely disappointed i have the ability to do it
2737759 thats my goal to just go in there and make the final if i can do that then anything is possible
2737760 whats the thing that people say if its not broke then dont fix it
2737761 i think me staying at lsu is going to lead to even more success in the future i just feel like im a lot more focused when im here and i need to stay in the kind of environment that is conducive to success if i just continue to do the things ive been doing then i know things will work out for me
2737762 richard is still very young but his future in this sport is very bright
2737763 he has what i think are the components both mentally and physically to become one of the best at what he does
2737764 the act of giving something up is painful but as we negotiate the curves and corners of our lives we must continually give up parts of ourselves the only alternative is not to travel at all on the journey of life
2737765 the two he missed were a couple feet from being in
2737766 eat what you can and what you cant eat can
2737767 you see this water carefully contained on my hand it symbolizes
2737768 this was how i saw it as long as you keep your hand caringly open and allow it to remain there it will always be there however if you attempt to close your fingers round it and try to posses it it will spill through the first cracks it finds this is the greatest mistake that people do when they meet love they try to posses it they demand they expect and just like the water spilling out of your hand love will retrieve from you for love is meant to be free you cannot change its nature if there are people you love allow them to be free beings give and dont expect advise but dont order ask but never demand it might sound simple but it is a lesson that may take a lifetime to truly practice it is the secret to to truly practice it you must sincerely feel no expectations from those who you love and yet an unconditional caring

2737779 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2737780 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2737781 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2737782 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2737783 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2737784 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2737792 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2737793 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2737810 we sometimes go to france for training and i have met him darbelet many times and had drinks together as for the final itself i really dont remember how i won it
2737811 when i go home i want to take a look at the video to see what actually happened
2737812 i thought that i would be able to get out of his joint lock that he applied especially since ive offered him many drinks at my house in france but he is a great champion and i congratulate him
2737813 my opponent in the semis was so much stronger than i was in the match for third place i am glad i could execute an outer leg trip but i want to use this disappointment as a springboard
2737814 i wanted the gold and i did everything possible to get it today
2737815 i swam as i have been practicing i was calm during the race and hope to build on todays performance in the semifinal
2737816 i kept the same tempo all the way to the end i think i have to improve my time from the heats to the semis and into the final the level of racing is quite high so its going to be tough

2737833 southeast works executive director judith shanley tells me she is still interested in the building and i told her that if she could work something out with the village of depew thats fine with me
2737834 were looking at another winter of possibly keeping that building heated
2737835 we have no one rushing to buy it property as it can only be used to build a house or community building on
2737836 you supervisor giza told me harper industrial was going elsewhere in hopes of getting empire zone consideration has there been anyone else looking to purchase that building
2737837 they seemed to be in a hurry at first and now theyre dragging their feet
2737838 werent we supposed to put the building up for bid
2737839 i thought you were going to put the building up for bid
2737840 well then dont you think we should advertise its sale
2737841 we should put it out to bid with conditions on the sale that the party cant move in until we move the detectives and stored materials out
2737842 i thought that was decided the night harper was in and showed interest in purchasing the building a month has passed and we still havent put it up for bid to use this 76 000 square foot building to house but a detective squad is crazy since 2004 we have been losing 250 000 in tax dollars every year its time to get this building back on the tax rolls

2737868 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally

2737870 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2737871 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2737872 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2737873 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2737874 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2737875 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2737876 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2737877 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2737878 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2737879 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2737880 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2737881 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools

2737884 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

2737926 heresy is the obstinate denial or obstinate doubt after the reception of baptism of some truth which is to be believed by divine and catholic faith apostasy is the total repudiation of the christian faith schism is the refusal of submission to the supreme pontiff or of communion with the members of the church subject to him
2737927 an apostate from the faith a heretic or a schismatic incurs a latae sententiae excommunication
2737928 therefore by the authority which christ conferred upon peter and his successors and in communion with the bishops of the catholic church i confirm that the direct and voluntary killing of an innocent human being is always gravely immoral this doctrine based upon that unwritten law which man in the light of reason finds in his own heart cf rom 2 14 15 is reaffirmed by sacred scripture transmitted by the tradition of the church and taught by the ordinary and universal magisterium

2737933 someone tipped off the eagle tribune that alex had been found before the family was notified
2737934 and when we arrived to deliver the devastating news to andy alexs father who lives in lawrence the tribune was already in the house snapping pictures as the family was told breaking down in tears it was total exploitation of this family who had been through so much we were horrified by the picture they ran on the front page the next day it was such an invasion of privacy
2737935 first what happened to andy alexs father was not right they came to the house and took a picture during private time for the family i wasnt there so you should talk to him
2737936 but i know he was very sad about that and it should not have happened
2737937 i dont know why they were there just to get a picture of us crying and embarrass us in their newspaper

2737961 a large trend is being crystallized among the palestinian national authority pna in ramallah to call for settling the situation with the gaza strip by force
2737962 to give the last chance for the egyptian government and the arab league to convince hamas to immediately end its coup and engage in the dialogue
2737963 but the door for dialogue will not be open forever and the leadership only gave one month time for the efforts
2737964 will be a dangerous thing if it was officially made
2737965 it will boost the internal split and separate gaza from the west bank
2737966 fatah elements who dominate the plos executive committee have a plan to prevent any attempt of approach between hamas and fatah
2737967 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2737968 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2737969 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2737970 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2737971 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2737972 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2737973 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2737974 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2737975 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2737976 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2737977 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2737978 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2737979 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2737980 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2737981 we will continue to investigate to see what is happening at the plant to see what they have to do to get a handle on their food safety issues
2737982 that was self created i felt like looking back on it tony was a little bit better than us and i felt like i should have put him in the position to try to have to make the pass instead of me giving it up to him like i did and make a mistake
2737983 its a lesson learned as always this car we definitely learned some things about the car since then hopefully we can get ourselves in that same position and see if we can have different results
2737984 i need bonus points a lot more this year than i did last year
2737985 youll probably see me spin out three times going into turn 1 this weekend i think im going to try doing it in practice more than in the race so maybe we resolve the issue
2737986 a lot of us were fighting that same issue going in there to turn 1 this year were going to push hard we have at least tried to address that wheel hop issue specifically here in turn 1
2737987 hes really strong on the road courses hes really proved that and that team has proved that in the last three or four years and so i look to them to be tough again add comment
2737988 we were not waiting on anybody to decide weve just got to make sure everything is right before we do anything
2737989 it helps the whole organization so i was happy to see that
2737990 it gives us some stability and now we can go forward with some plans for next year
2737991 we havent had the runs that weve wanted weve had good runs we havent been able to capitalize on them the tools are there we just have to make use of them
2737992 we have nothing to announce on the 8 theres still some available inventory on the 8 but by and large its a funded program
2737993 the 1 is settled with truex the 15 is good with menard add comment
2737994 the crazy thing is i do a better job in these other vehicles than i do in a cup car i just have to figure out how to adapt my skills to this cup car and do a better job at it
2737995 through everything weve worked on to look at where speed may be and what i need to do its such a small difference that after it totals up over the course of the event and you get back to the start finish line theres a sizable margin
2737996 but to break down a corner and find something that im really doing wrong its not there its just a little everywhere the conclusion ive come up with is that i just need to do it more often
2737997 you were more worried about getting over the bumps and obstacles
2737998 there was more time to be had getting over those bumps than there was in the corners
2737999 and thats why that asa series did me so much justice my crew chief literally sat me down with these vhs tapes and a book from this guy named duke sutherlin that walked me through the basics of stock car racing and i remember it took me months to understand wedge and he literally went in the office and took the little adjusters off the floor you know that get the table level and walked me through what wedge was and how it worked and then it made sense so it just took me a while to understand stock car racing and really what makes a car work through the turns and how to do that stuff because i was going straight and jumping stuff and in the air
2738000 when you get in the car and youre looking for a half tenth of a second per corner and it totals up to a three or four tenth advantage come to start finish its really tough to communicate those things
2738001 i seem to have the pace for a lap or for a handful of laps doing the right things but as the tires age i lose a little bit more time than i need to so im not sure if its being overaggressive or what that really is i keep searching for it and you cant find that half tenth per turn unless you get more seat time and just do it over and over and thats really where im at and trying to race as much as i can on a road course
2738002 i know for a fact we have all the tools
2738003 i watch jeff gordon win and do what he does and im sitting there with the same equipment
2738004 i honestly think that last year was my most fond memory of a race here
2738005 it was just a classic battle between jeff and myself jeffs history in the series has obviously spoken for itself but the accomplishments that he has had as a road course driver too are very strong
2738006 having that battle with him and having it come down to the last couple laps like that was a race that ill remember the rest of my life
2738007 mistakes by both cost us the lead at certain points in the race
2738008 obviously last year was the first time we had come here with the new car and we did not know how we had to have it feel in happy hour to have it perfect for the race
2738009 thats what made the race fun was the fact that nobody had a perfect race car
2738010 we never had an opportunity to relax and jeff never had an opportunity to relax we pressured each other to the end a little mistake here or there made a huge difference at the end it was just trying to still run 100 percent but not make mistakes at the same time and minimize the opportunity to have a mistake
2738011 i am not pretty my hair isnt pretty my clothes arent pretty i try and i try and i try but i am never going to be pretty i am always just going to be me
2738012 where did you get that from who told you that did someone hurt your feelings at camp
2738013 you are a grownup you arent like me you dont know
2738014 this is all the tricky stuff of growing up you know we humans are silly sometimes we belly up to the things that scare us and give them a good old poke in the nose other times we take those same fears and give them a pat on the back
2738015 its really hard to figure out which to do when even when you are a grownup its difficult

2738056 one of the most important lessons of the wars in iraq and afghanistan is that military success is not sufficient to win
2738057 we need to believe in the power of american diplomacy and we should not believe a military conflict with iran is inevitable
2738058 our first impulse should be a serious and patient and persistent diplomatic effort too often in our national debate we focus on the military option and give short shrift to the diplomatic option
2738059 all of this will require foreign service brains expertise and experience but as kristof points out the us has more musicians in its military bands than diplomats

2738062 the all important thing you will need this year is the
2738063 they are hot also go for the r of these
2738064 the only thing you will need is an abercrombie amp fitch hoodie he said
2738065 you really want to just be yourself and be casual the hoodie allows you to do that the super soft hoodies pictured the shaw pond dark gray from abercrombie amp fitch 69 50 are made of 85 percent cotton and 15 percent polyester
2738066 in my opinion its best to mix plain basic dresses or these boots from urban outfitters you can take a plain white t shirt and skinny jeans and look absolutely fabulous it gives you that hardcore but simple look lots of designers are going for right now you can never go wrong with boots frye boots just keep getting more popular you can mix leather boots with almost anything also you can mix them with dresses like this one the silence and noise lace trim tank dress 98 pictured or this one from urban outfitters and spice your style up
2738067 right now i think that the hottest things are halter dresses with a funky design colored leggings or a solid color halter dress with designed leggings along with a tote bag belt flats and sunglasses she said
2738068 and lately it seems that mens vests are in style for girls so i think a funky print tank under a button down shirt with a vest on top of it with dark skinny jeans and flats that match the tank is a good look

2738085 there has been some evidence of weakening demand but it is pretty minimal
2738086 2007 was a peak year for international travel so it would be wrong to overstate any reversal major cities such as paris london and amsterdam are still extremely busy some hotels are reporting a weakening in meetings bookings by the banking and financial services sectors but bookings from the pharmaceutical sector remain buoyant
2738087 europe has not seen or is only beginning to see a softening
2738088 everyone is talking about decline but no one is experiencing it yet however we know that the city londons equivalent of wall street is laying off thousands of people and rising oil prices mean that companies will have to look at travel budgets whatever happens to demand there will be tough negotiations because hoteliers and investors had budgeted for rates to continue growing over the next few years
2738089 we are seeing occupancy plateau a little it would be na ve for us to discount all the leading indicators but the headline numbers say we are ok and we remain cautiously optimistic the expectation from our shareholders is that we will at the very least be growing rates in line with the market so we will continue to be somewhat aggressive hotel supply in europe has grown but not nearly as much as when we last reached this stage of the curve and as a result the situation wont be nearly as severe for us buyers should gird their loins for some challenging negotiations
2738090 in the past they said they didnt like the idea because the market was so strong
2738091 dynamic pricing is more market sensitive they could make some really big savings lets look at it for locations where you do not have a lot of business
2738092 corporate clients run the risk that the longer they wait the more the market might improve
2738093 i wouldnt want to wait until october because by the time rates get loaded in q1 or q2 next year our owners wouldnt like that our financial year is january to december and we would have to pass on our general rate increases
2738094 four star and three star hotels are holding up well but there is some evidence that the luxury market is having a tougher time
2738095 still the number one city for rates and still a nightmare

2738141 we did it it was perfect its a dream come true
2738142 we made plans for this a little over 12 months ago and sat down as a kind of working group going over all the scenarios for beijing
2738143 its just like a dream come true and i hope everyone can share in this dream its been a very long journey to get here so many people have helped me and i really hope they have the same feelings as i do
2738144 sometimes i felt like i was drowning there was so much water on the road
2738145 i knew it would be a good finish for me although i knew both nicole and tatiana also had a good finish
2738146 our team plan was to attack because we wanted to try to whittle down the field as much as possible so we could arrive at the finish line with as few riders as possible

2738192 no more secrets a family speaks about depression anxiety and attempted suicide
2738193 for nine years we couldnt say three words in this family suicide anti depressants or therapy
2738194 this book and being able to speak out is the reason god put me on this earth
2738195 this is what he is called to do articulately passionately and honestly we dont have to conceal the truth anymore
2738196 struggling at the moment to keep within the range of the weather conditions that they have committed for the quality for the athletes
2738197 a little bit of wind a little bit of rain can change the numbers significantly
2738198 and i hope that bit of luck will also be part of the next few days
2738199 at the moment the international olympic committee the beijing organizing committee and the whole olympic movement are clearly watching the numbers
2738200 as you know there has been a lot of talk about who world health organization guidelines and about national standards
2738201 at the moment the pollution levels have been increasing over the last few days but likely to stabilize the ioc is in charge of determining at what point an event might have to postponed or shifted
2738202 that circumstance has not yet arisen according to the data
2738203 for all intents and purposes the data that are available to me right now indicates that according to national standards and who guidelines in terms of the intermediate steps for a developing nation its currently being met by the conditions that are in place for athletes here
2738204 i think any athlete should not be blamed for being concerned about this issue
2738205 you know you come here you want to win the gold medal this is the one day perhaps when you are going to perform better than ever obviously you want ideal conditions
2738206 but the truth is across the world environment is becoming a challenge for us as human beings and i only need to remind you that air pollution is not an issue unique to beijing
2738207 we dont need to talk about a cervelat crisis anymore
2738208 these new latin american markets have recently increased their deliveries of intestines we are able to guarantee 100 percent of our cervelat production
2738209 there is no danger of the cervelat becoming a luxury item we can say that its saved
2738210 down to earth simplicity the romanticism of the campfire and national pride
2738211 for the past month ive been receiving so much treatment and ive been doing everything to recover after montreal where i really wasnt able to play after there it was so painful i took some time off and havent played a tournament in 10 days even yesterday we flew a doctor in from australia to help with my hand
2738212 its a great feeling davis cup is one thing but its the same kind of nerves when youre playing for something more than just yourself its a ton of fun
2738213 it was the largest rain dispersal operation in china and the first time that such technology has been used to ensure the weather conditions for the olympic opening
2738214 you use the monkey bread fruit if you have a belly ache
2738215 if youre tired you eat the leaves they are good for you
2738216 opening the european market to this product will make a real difference to poor rural communities there offering them a potentially life changing source of income
2738217 ive collected the fruits since i was a little girl with my grandmother
2738218 its better to sell here than there you dont have to wear yourself out going to thies
2738219 now we collect 150 to 200 tonnes of baobab fruit each harvest in the last weeks there has been an explosion in demand
2738220 we are thinking we will need a much bigger harvest next time
2738221 in senegal alone we estimate we could collect 13 thousand tonnes of fruit
2738222 and if it becomes an important revenue the farmers will know that they have to protect the tree
2738223 there are cattle herders that cut the leaves to feed their animals but we are starting to stop them now thats not good because we need the trees to produce fruit
2738224 everybody is asking for our products so they can test them

2738226 the court is suggesting that giving a presentation involving security to other security researchers is a violation of federal law this has a tremendous chilling effect on research we intend to fight it with everything weve got
2738227 we disagree with the ruling but we are not going to disobey it
2738228 we wanted to share our academic work with the security community if you want to fix a system you need to know what is wrong with it
2738229 if the discoverer discloses the vulnerability to a broader audience hackers and other malicious users may be able to exploit the vulnerability
2738230 it is strongly in the public interest to protect this system
2738231 the order does not appear to contemplate it is talking about a person who is giving a talk to humans
2738232 if you are truthfully telling the world about a dangerous situation this should of course be free speech
2738233 hendrix was just a sweet guy to an extent he was murdered by the people around him because they didnt take care of him
2738234 we are hopeful that the nuclear suppliers group nsg will not be unreasonable in giving clean and unconditional waiver to india in the coming weeks negotiations
2738235 either the current package of the deal or no further giving in
2738236 we dont think the nsg will be in the end unreasonable to let india move ahead
2738237 by coming out of nuclear isolation india can be part of a decision making process in issues like a country acquiring nuclear technology in a clandestine manner or some terrorist and anti national groups acquiring nuclear arms or weapons of mass destruction
2738238 when pakistan and china have nuclear bombs why cannot india possess the same
2738239 the deal is a step to put behind the past regime of denial as the us has understood that there is no point in continuing with the embargo
2738240 since us has allowed india to drop the comprehensive safeguards from the draft that was circulated by us to the nsg member countries and with president george w bush writing personally to all the 44 members of nsg we hope to get a favourable stand from nsg
2738241 i was talking to our leader ohio republican john boehner later in the day and he was as struck with that as i was
2738242 this is reaching the american people whether nbc cbs abc decide to do much with it im not interested
2738243 the new media much of which is gathered around this table and cable television media and talk radio has taken this to the country
2738244 i just think we got to right now focus that enormous energy across the country
2738245 the district administration has lifted curfew in border towns of kathua and poonch since 0600 hours on sunday after four days of its imposition in view of betterment in law and order situation

2738247 however there were no violent clashes with police or army at any place there were no violent protests the situation is tense but under control

2738259 admiraci n de forma repetitiva se observa constantemente en ella al mismo tiempo que una perplejidad desesperada
2738260 la existencia es tener confianza en la manera de ser es sin duda la evidencia natural que me falta

2738272 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2738273 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2738274 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2738275 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2738276 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2738277 you think mannys too old for a long term contract
2738278 that hasnt worked out too well for anyone except sheffield and his agent players like manny ramirez and gary sheffield are exactly what keep teams like the red sox the mets the dodgers and especially the yankees from winning 100 games every year
2738279 wants to play for the yankees so he can get at the red sox
2738280 i dont know about manny going to the new york especially in pinstripes
2738281 boras is banking how is this guy not get banned from baseball they did it to bonds this year why not do it to boras next this is ridiculous all manny cares about is money so the yankees would be the perfect fit all the complaints about the media etc is bs
2738282 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2738283 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2738284 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2738285 we had a hard time convincing people that obama is funny for a long time our audiences seemed unsure whether to laugh at him the first black president is not a gag but thats changing because hes doing more stuff thats easy to mock and people are more familiar with him
2738286 he did this speech and 100 000 people showed up there were so many germans shouting and screaming that france surrendered just in case
2738287 they really love barack obama in germany hes like a rock star over there impressive until you realize that david hasselhoff is also like a rock star over there
2738288 of course obamas supporters got him his usual birthday gifts of gold frankincense and myrrh
2738289 obamas people are trying to portray mccain as cranky and mccain is trying to portray obama as arrogant you see
2738290 see barack obama on the news hes becoming a workout fanatic hes at the gym like twice a day sometimes three times a day at the gym yeah according to his staff well he has to stay in shape to do those flip flops
2738291 barack obama back from his big european tour did you see him in europe people were cheering him holding up signs blowing him kisses and that was just the american media covering the story

2738293 team blues rally 2 is now at the stage the switchbox 3000 is missing maybe theyre gonna use it for something else there is a new background for nonmembers in the costume catalog
2738294 after a day of heightening international tensions georgian leaders claimed that the baku tbilisi ceyhan pipeline which transports oil from the caspian sea to turkey had been attacked but it is thought the bombs missed their target their claims came after russian jets struck deep into the territory of its tiny neighbour killing civilians and completely devastating the strategic black sea port of poti a staging post for oil and other energy supplies
2738295 crucial to the worlds volatile energy market and the only oil and gas route that bypasses russias stranglehold on energy exports from the region
2738296 new book out and making the move to open access
2738297 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
2738298 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
2738299 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
2738300 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
2738301 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
2738302 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
2738303 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
2738304 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
2738305 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
2738306 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
2738307 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
2738308 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
2738309 when an action is rationally justified how can reason deny its legitimacy
2738310 this revision of the academic understanding of technology contributes to weakening technocratic rationales for public policy a new era of technical politics has begun
2738311 the schools stare fixedly into the past as we hurtle pell mell into the future
2738312 they are characteristics of the spirit mood language and process of science they are operative wherever evidence of social change can be found
2738313 a new kind of person one who is an actively inquiring flexible creative innovative tolerant liberal personality who can face uncertainty and ambiguity without disorientation who can formulate viable new meanings to meet changes in the environment which threaten individual and mutual survival
2738314 if i feel anxious every time someone is staring at me well i cant control what they stare at but my reaction is im just not going to go outside the house im going to stay in and chill and when i do go out i understand what comes along with that
2738315 look at the attention i get its because i throw a football but thats what society values thats not what god values god could give a shi t as far as im concerned he didnt invent the game we did i have some eye hand coordination and i can throw the ball i dont think that matters to god
2738316 im just happy to get the first one under my belt
2738317 i started to get chills on my body and knew i was starting to get excited
2738318 you not only do your best time and break his old world record and you are still looking at his feet

2738381 its not the fault of the children whether or not their parents are married
2738382 children and mothers living in davao can apply before the japanese embassy once the law takes effect
2738383 japanese filipino children from 16 to 19 years old should prepare their documents as soon as possible

2738392 they need food money and mostly the mothers are already married in other cases their japanese husbands divorced them without their consent sometimes the husbands falsify the signatures of their wives so we help the woman file a criminal case and require the husbands to give financial support

2738533 you can see it on the faces of the soldiers as they go in and out of the airport either going on leave or to return to their battle space
2738534 we joined the uso and this enables us to be with them on the secure side prior to their leaving
2738535 we are assigned to load our carts with goodies such as food stuffs water toiletries books pillows cell phones and we get a chance to really visit and take our pictures
2738536 i have been in touch with them for over 3 years and they always meet me at the airport
2738537 whether you are for the war or against the war democrat or republican whatever it doesnt make any difference as these young men are there sacrificing their lives for us they are giving up more than people realize
2738538 a lot of the people in high level govt positions remember swimming in this pool when they were children
2738539 there is a lot of pride associated with it in the community
2738540 we did our best to finish it in one month and it is a great job
2738541 this is a great indication of security the beginnings of liberty and all of those good things that are needed in order for a true society to begin again
2738542 thanks to a concerned citizen who provided the info on a potential vbied it was able to be secured without loss or injury to any civilians
2738543 because of citizens like the one who notified authorities of this potential deadly bomb the streets of adhamiyah remain a safe and prosperous place for residents
2738544 this shows that the residents of this once volatile neighborhood will not tolerate those actions any longer
2738545 transitioning authority to the iraqi sf in accordance with mnd b goals has been a top priority
2738546 when we first started working with the nps they were just loosely banded together
2738547 now they are organized and do their own patrols even the way they handle their weapons has improved
2738548 as we continue forward to over watch our roles as observers increase we are there to support the np as needed but give them the freedom to conduct their daily mission

2738556 andrew young is the father of ms hunters unborn child
2738557 sen edwards knew nothing about the relationship between these former co workers which began when they worked together in 2006
2738558 as a private citizen who no longer works for the campaign mr young asks that the media respect his privacy while he works to make amends with his family
2738559 i wish to extend my condolences to sir stanleys family and to recognise the contribution he made to the force and in particular his work with local communities

2738564 chemical substances in gel and liquid form that were sealed in bottles and glass jars
2738565 the united states did not have knowledge of her whereabouts until she was detained by the afghan police on july 17
2738566 ms siddiqui was not in custody of the united states either at bagram air base in afghanistan or anywhere else at any time prior to her detention on july 17
2738567 any rumors or allegations to the contrary are absolutely baseless and without any credible foundation whatsoever
2738568 this is my last chance to get as much food into myself as i can before having to starve till sunset
2738569 not to be absolutely certain is i think one of the essential things in rationality
2738570 in certain areas of north cotabato with a specific group of milf all peaceful means have been exhausted to resolve the conflicts and we are now compelled to resort to the application of justifiable force
2738571 trust and mistrust of evidence based medicine among latinos with hiv
2738572 amfar is a prestigious organization to get funding from if you do hiv research so its a big testament to the work were doing
2738573 we hope that it will help us reach latinos who are at risk for hiv and improve the outcomes for hiv positive latinos so they are not affected disproportionately
2738574 latinos generally do not go to the doctor to get tested to see if they are infected with hiv until they are very very sick
2738575 and once diagnosed they dont take their medicine as prescribed even when they have access to life extending medicines
2738576 there are a number of different things that are affecting the attitudes and opinions toward medicine of the latino community this study will give us a sense of all the variables that are affecting the trust or mistrust of medicine
2738577 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2738578 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2738579 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2738580 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2738581 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2738582 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2738583 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2738584 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2738585 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2738586 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2738587 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2738588 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2738589 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2738590 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2738591 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2738592 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2738593 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2738594 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2738595 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2738596 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2738597 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2738598 i have been training a lot with my brother to achieve this win
2738599 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2738600 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2738601 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2738602 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2738603 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2738604 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2738605 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2738606 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2738607 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2738608 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2738609 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2738610 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2738611 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2738612 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2738613 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2738614 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2738615 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2738616 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2738617 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2738618 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2738619 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2738620 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2738621 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2738622 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2738623 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2738624 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2738625 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2738626 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2738627 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2738628 dejad que los ni os vengan a m y no los estorb is porque de los tales es el reino de dios
2738629 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2738630 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2738631 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2738632 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2738633 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2738634 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2738635 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2738636 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2738637 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2738638 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2738639 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2738640 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2738641 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2738642 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2738643 they told me that i was a hero and that they wished they could do the same in their countries
2738644 its very difficult to provide services to men who have sex with men in countries that dont acknowledge they exist or criminalize them if they do exist
2738645 to follow mexicos bold example and pass laws against homophobia
2738646 its a virus so you need to put the money where the virus is
2738647 these men believed they were not at risk because they were not having sex with sex workers or women which is what the campaign focused on
2738648 that scenario is being played out across the developing world
2738649 instead of saying they are gay its easier for them to justify their behavior they say they were drunk and they were really sexually excited and willing to have sex with whomever
2738650 in iran we dont have homosexuals like in your country
2738651 this means that we are not moving ahead with the fight against aids
2738652 totally panicked because until now they believed these men did not exist
2738653 i tell them to say things like there are many cultures where men are very close to men
2738654 if anyone asks a man that he will slap you
2738655 ketika allah swt sayang kepada hamba hamba nya yang kafir maka allah swt perkenankan memberikan mereka hidayah untuk memeluk islam dan ketika allah swt sayang kepada hamba hamba nya yang muslim maka allah swt gunakan mereka untuk menyebarkan risalah nya
2738656 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2738657 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2738658 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2738682 a reader comes to the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism with high expectations one is likely to get up however feeling frustrated confused and in need of further reassurance from the author as to the substance of some of the books most serious allegations

2738690 the cost in terms of liberties lost and the unnecessary exposure to terrorism are difficult to determine but in time it will become apparent to all of us that foreign interventionism is of no benefit to american citizens but is instead a threat to our liberties

2738703 weve made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2738704 we deplore the dangerous and disproportionate actions by russian forces and we would be particularly troubled if these attacks are continuing now as the georgians are pulling back
2738705 very very concerned if in fact there is ground action inside of georgia proper that is outside of these areas of abkhazia and ossetia
2738706 both presidents have the same position and agree across the board but specifically on these three points that there needs to be a ceasefire there needs to be disengagement and there needs to be respect for georgian territorial integrity

2738711 didnt you say that i am not needed anymore but more importantly what is your real form
2738712 i had a daughter in the past an infant baby her father was a creep i broke up with him after she was born she was adoreable like an angel even though i was a singer i was a heavy smoker sad right i stopped smoking while i was pregnant but i should have stopped for good i carelessly left a cigarette somewhere within her reach so she put it in her mouth and before i knew it she chocked and died

2738720 o lord of the universe soul of the universe o personality of the form of the universe please therefore sever my tie of affection for my kinsmen the pandavas and the vrisinis o lord of madhu as the ganges forever flows to the sea without hindrance let my attraction be constantly drawn unto you without being diverted to anyone else
2738721 abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto me i shall deliver you from all sinful reactions do not fear
2738722 but my people would not hearken to my voice and israel would none of me so i gave them up unto their own hearts lust and they walked in their own counsels
2738723 let him that is unjust be unjust still and let him which is filthy be filthy still
2738724 in thy filthiness is lewdness because i have purged thee and thou wast not purged thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more till i have caused my fury to rest upon thee
2738725 this child jesus was set for the fall as well as for the rising of many in israel
2738726 behold i lay in zion a stumbling and a rock of offense
2738727 the stone which the builders refused is made a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient whereunto also they were appointed
2738728 for judgment i am come into this world that they which see not might see and that they which see might be made blind
2738729 but the word of the lord was unto them precept upon precept line upon line here a little and there a little that they might go and fall backward and be broken and snared and taken
2738730 for it is god that worketh in you to will and to do of his own good pleasure
2738731 twere the greatest folly imaginable to trifle with one that works at so perfect liberty under no obligation that may desist when he will to impose upon so absolutely sovereign and arbitrary an agent that owes you nothing and from whose former gracious operations not complied with you can draw no argument unto any following ones that because he doth therefore he will as there is no certain connection between present time and future but all time is made up of undepending not strictly coherent moments so as no man can be sure because one now exists another shall there is also no more certain connection between the arbitrary acts of a free agent within such time so that i can not be sure because he now darts in light upon me is now convincing me now awakening me therefore he will still do so again and again
2738732 oh that my people had hearkened unto me and israel had walked in my ways

2738815 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2738816 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2738817 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2738818 darlin self mana beyond shaping ease your delta and arrestation the satellite conjugal love up to datish
2738819 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2738820 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2738821 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2738822 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2738823 but we have stood with one another through them all although john believes he should stand alone and take the consequences of his action now when the door closes behind him he has his family waiting for him
2738824 john made a terrible mistake in 2006 the fact that it is a mistake that many others have made before him did not make it any easier for me to hear when he told me what he had done but he did tell me and we began a long and painful process in 2006 a process oddly made somewhat easier with my diagnosis in march 2007
2738825 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2738826 admitting ones mistakes is a hard thing for anyone to do and i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame the toll on our family of news helicopters over our house and reporters in our driveway is yet unknown but now the truth is out and the repair work that began in 2006 will continue
2738827 i ask that the public who expressed concern about the harm
2738828 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2738841 eventually the big cat was able to sit on top of the reptile and suffocate it
2738842 i started doing it last month because i was turning 80 but at the top of the escalator in elphicks is the womens underwear department and the woman who runs it told me to stop because it was dangerous as a young man i used to run up the escalator on the underground in london but that was a long time ago i started off doing it in bits and then did it getting on at the bottom i used to do it about once a week as part of my training when i was not on the track or in the gym
2738843 we have people aged 80 who go the right way up the escalator and fall over so we simply cant have this man attempting this sort of thing

2738855 he translated the pain of the palestinians in a magical way he made us cry and made us happy and shook our emotions
2738856 apart from being the poet of the palestinian wound which is hurting all arabs and all honest people in the world he is a master poet
2738857 this great figure whose poetry which reflects nostalgia and liberty speaks to us all
2738858 mahmoud darwish knew how to express the attachment of an entire people to its land and the absolute desire for peace his message which calls for coexistence will continue to resonate and will eventually be heard
2738859 the palestinian question in mahmoud darwishs poetry was no longer a legend but the story of people made of flesh blood and feelings
2738860 the voice of palestinian civilization with its pains sadness and ambitions
2738861 he turned the palestinian cause into songs that transcended the cause and all other arab issues
2738862 today i have come bearing an olive branch and a freedom fighters gun do not let the olive branch fall from my hand

2738889 and theyve done it that doesnt even count what can happen in the flex scheduling

2738904 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
2738905 its not us i dont think its us i really dont
2738906 i said that from the beginning i said coming into this tournament i dont think were the favorites and i think were going to relish that role that underdog role
2738907 argentina won in 2004 spain is up there so i dont think the world sees us as the favorites
2738908 we want people to understand that this is going to be a tough task
2738909 i think some people do understand that its not going to be easy because if it was we would have won in 2004 we would have won in 2006
2738910 i think theres been so much media hype and media attention that were probably the favorites when it comes to the general population but they really dont matter
2738911 if you talk to spain argentina or greece or any of those teams theyre not intimidated by us one bit not at all so i mean those are the guys that really count
2738912 nothing thats surprising anymore to me i believe every team that we play and every individual that we play is good
2738913 theyre on their national team just like were on our national team so they have to be good were not looking at any team or downplaying any individual on any team at all
2738914 the olympics are another level up from other games obviously a very different environment because it only happens once every four years
2738915 for us this will be the most competitive olympics thus far again in london that will then be the most competitive
2738916 it will not get easier to win the gold medal for anybody itll continually get harder as the sport grows worldwide
2738917 we know what we are but know not what we may be
2738918 i try to view the challenges in my life not as annoyances but as confirmations of fortitude
2738919 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2738920 ok sometimes being with someone is not necessarily better than being alone
2738921 se nasci e morrerei ent o toda exist ncia que sabe de si mesma tem que saber de sua pr pria proced ncia
2738922 so edwards can deny that the child is his and say hes perfectly willing to take a dna case to prove it now all we need is a test to prove that edwards and hunter didnt arrange it so that shed look like the one who chose not to demonstrate whether edwards is the father maybe some sort of test to determine if hes paying child support directly or indirectly but that would be far more complicated and invasive than the dna test
2738923 i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2738924 found 90 000 of the cash in the freezer in 10 000 increments wrapped in aluminum foil and stuffed inside frozen food containers
2738925 we will not skimp on security we actually brought on a security adviser from the israel defense forces probably the best in the world
2738926 i cannot allow for my private failings to disrupt the peoples work
2738927 over the course of my public life i have insisted i believe correctly that people take responsibility for their conduct i can and will ask no less of myself for this reason i am resigning from the office of governor
2738928 ive responded consistently to these tabloid allegations by saying i dont respond to these lies and you know that
2738929 i also think we were a little untethered that our lives involved a lot of sort of drifting in and out of worlds here and there
2738930 make no mistake about it change was always saul d alinskys code word for creating a socialist revolution even if the methodology meant radicals would cut their hair put on business suits and run for political office alinsky taught community organizers like obama to hide their true intentions in the words they spoke
2738931 yeah yeah yeah ive heard this a bizillion times tell me something i dont know
2738932 democracy is to be defined at the ballot box not through violence
2738933 in the first half there were not enough players up to the right level of performance and thats what cost us
2738934 i had to go in at half time and read the riot act but you shouldnt have to do that in the first game
2738935 i thought owen storey did ok up front getting himself into goal scoring situations a couple of times with that pace
2738936 he has got tremendous pace and probably should have finished but if he keeps getting there i am sure he will do well
2738937 to be fair to lee ayres i felt his nomination as the man of the match was a fair shout
2738938 to steal ideas from one person is plagiarism to steal from many is research
2738939 we get a lot of questions about whether all inclusive deals are cheaper
2738940 it depends how you like to travel couples who get the most out foxbusiness jul 17 2008

2738942 when a great mind is interrupted disturbed and distracted it is capable of no more than a commonplace mind
2738943 abolition of a desire and the extinction of a pain
2738944 an ethical position that repudiates moral relativism but avoids all theology
2738945 well if our descriptions are only our descriptions descriptions shaped by our interests and nature then what is the description of the things as they are in themselves
2738946 perhaps kant is right perhaps we cant help thinking that there is somehow a mind independent ground for our experience even if attempts to talk about it lead at once to nonsense
2738947 wasnt anyone watching didnt anyone notice what was going on

2738973 we had a hard time convincing people that obama is funny for a long time our audiences seemed unsure whether to laugh at him the first black president is not a gag but thats changing because hes doing more stuff thats easy to mock and people are more familiar with him
2738974 barack obama has long been his partys presumptive nominee now hes becoming its presumptuous nominee
2738975 barack obama now says hes open to offshore oil drilling so apparently when he promised change he was talking about his mind

2738984 oppose military action whether invasion or air strikes bombing raids etc or economic sanctions against iran we characterise any realistically likely military conflict between the us and iran as one between two imperialisms an imperialist superpower and a regional sub imperialism a conflict between iran and israel would constitute war between two sub imperialisms with one most likely backed by the american superpower

2739020 the radically collaborative technologies emerging on the web create the possibility for doing scholarship in the mode of conversation rather than argument or to transform the argument as war metaphor into something that suggests collaboration rather than combat
2739021 you dont get to do too much tackling out in the centres and generally when youre playing on the wing you just catch a cold but it was fun and im excited to be playing rugby
2739022 i got a little bit too excited at one stage but it was just a good feeling being out there and playing
2739023 im a professional sportsman and i know what i need to do to get out there and perform to my best
2739024 ive just concentrated on what i have to do and thats learning the game learning what the team is trying to do and learning my role within the team
2739025 im a rugby union player now and ive got goals that ive set so this is just the start hopefully to a long and successful rugby career
2739026 theres short term goals and theres long term goals like playing for the all blacks
2739027 i want to become a dominant no 13 and be considered one of the best centres going around in world rugby and i want to play for the all blacks one day but first i just want to play good footy i want to win the competition with toulon and repay the faith that tana has shown in me by getting out there and helping his team
2739028 one hundred per cent its a new game and a new challenge and i know ive got a lot to learn but im excited to be learning off one of the all time greats in tana umaga
2739029 i think if i am as committed as i was to playing rugby league and learning the game then the next two years will work out
2739030 i think probably a forward going into the forwards would be a lot more difficult because theres a lot of things that are different
2739031 theres a lot of different aspects of the game that ive got to pick up but i believe that its just a matter of me being committed and putting in the hard yards
2739032 i know its easy saying that but we didnt perform against dublin in the second half we didnt perform in the second half at all and we let ourselves down
2739033 there was big pressure against down but we got the result out of it there was no pressure on us today and it showed in the last 20 minutes
2739034 hendrix was just a sweet guy to an extent he was murdered by the people around him because they didnt take care of him
2739035 beijing now seems likely to overcome potential stumbling blocks such as economic instability pollution inequality corruption and a slow pace of political reform
2739036 chinas financial system rather than a liability is on the whole a source of confidence in optimistic growth scenarios
2739037 it is more meaningful to say that capital is created in the process of development rather than that development is a function of capital
2739038 ive obviously got to shoot some pretty good numbers coming in and tear up the course
2739039 if i can get back to something like even par that will be nice but the whole course is a lot easier so i dont think youll see scores slipping down any more
2739040 he hasnt been to the barriers for a jump out he hasnt been taken to any official trials were in for a long spring with the ultimate and sole goal the cox plate
2739041 ive had a meeting with owner bob scarborough and we both agreed that keeping light fantastics unbeaten record alive was not a consideration we both agreed that winning a cox plate outweighed keeping a winning sequence going
2739042 im happy the way he is but any talk of match races would be silly we are here to win the cox plate and that is the agenda
2739043 hes done well he looked good in a jump out last tuesday where he finished second but couldve easily won but hes got a long spring ahead of him so we didnt push him
2739044 probably the interesting feature about the liston will be that rain is forecast all week and we could well be presented with a heavy track but that will be on our side as he is a heavy track winner
2739045 itll be a tough race but im quite serious in saying that kibbutz has come back in fantastic shape
2739046 now i think about it im a bit tempted to wait a week or two because i think he is flying and would love him to win an early spring race
2739047 its been about 12 years and i think weve finished second about 12 times since our last win
2739048 it feels like ive got a huge load off my shoulders
2739049 weve committed a lot to do this ive dragged my family halfway across the world to do this
2739050 were a team thats moving forward and i feel like we needed a win to justify moving forward the way we plan to
2739051 we were able to put ourselves in the right position to win the race
2739052 its only four days down the track so we are holding out hope
2739053 what weve done is conduct a surface search of the river to eradicate that possibility from the investigation
2739054 we did explore options for two of the 737s to be checked in malaysia however as a space became available at tullamarine a decision was taken to have the work done there
2739055 now is the time qantas should sit down with us to commit now to maintaining maintenance operations onshore
2739056 from the veteran communitys point of view he is not the person we want in the job
2739057 he is representing veterans and our history and our contribution
2739058 during the vietnam war he left australia then actively campaigned against the war in the uk saying it was a sad day when the viet cong was defeated this is the guy weve got to deal with and thats not good enough
2739059 we would not consider him an appropriate person to be doing veterans affairs
2739060 his views on conscription at the time of the vietnam conflict are well known and were indeed shared by many other australians both at the time and across the spectrum of australian military and political history

2739072 shes got a beautiful smile shes a great athlete you can see the millions going on there
2739073 such infrastructure may perversely perpetuate the oil vulnerability of australias outer suburban regions at great cost
2739074 such schemes will largely direct new investment to central and middle suburban areas yet these are the zones that are already well served by high quality public transport infrastructure as reflected in the high use of these services by residents
2739075 it is time for action now the state government needs to start building railway extensions into growth corridors and ease the financial strain on people living in the outer suburbs
2739076 if we can stop the signal for the proliferation of uncontrolled growth of the cells then we can stop the leukemia in its tracks
2739077 normally in drug design it would be 15 years from start to finish but because of the nature of the surface we have to split apart the way ahead is antibodies and that is very straightforward technology
2739078 so i would expect the drug development would be a lot faster
2739079 not only is this a very important protein involved in disease the structure shows immediately how we can design drugs to treat the disease
2739080 in australia weve traditionally had a breadwinner model where one full time worker could support a family
2739081 now most families with two full time wage earners stay above the poverty line but those with just one are in poverty
2739082 wherever you go in afghanistan you are seen and people can blow you up
2739083 you did not have left handed people in the military
2739084 that was kind of fun to be a part of it
2739085 we are continuing to do what has brought us this far
2739086 we were very successful collecting signatures during the coast guard festival and at least 1 043 voters signed petitions at polling stations during the tuesday primary election
2739087 michigan has a system where each local community has a voice in their blue laws
2739088 the expectation is rightly or wrongly that the son will follow his old man
2739089 of course well support him in whatever he wants to do but hopefully hell grow out of it
2739090 he has an old western district umpires uniform and he spends a lot of time out the back blowing the whistle and making a few decisions
2739091 his favourite is matt stevic hes a bit obsessed with him hes written him a letter and got a reply this week which he was pretty excited about
2739092 its replacement could be wiisports a pentathlon of tennis bowling golf baseball and boxing
2739093 theres plenty of skill involved with perfecting the tennis power serve or getting the right spin on a bowling ball
2739094 there would also be the added joy of seeing a 9 year old win the gold medal
2739095 madhav wake up the lead and the others are waiting for you at the cafe hurry you bday cake is waitingggg
2739096 my son was first in double sticks fighting and second in singles stick fighting
2739097 their hard work paid off and i am very proud of their accomplishments to bring home four world titles is incredible
2739098 he should have won it but he had to go up against a person who will be 18 in six months
2739099 the guy i faced was not only much older than me but 6 foot 2
2739100 i really wanted to win i was bummed that i didnt
2739101 maybe im not suppose to say this but i like hitting people
2739102 i started martial arts when i was at hope college i really cant recall why i got into it it was just something i always wanted to do
2739103 i coach my son about four days a week and he works out once a week at the new hamilton karate center which opened in october of last year
2739104 even though hes probably in his late 60s i dont mess with him especially when he gets that look in his face
2739105 you get my age 78 you ask yourself are you really excited yes are you as excited as you were last year yes are you as excited as you were in 55 when you started yes about as far as i can tell im about as anxious this year as i was back then
2739106 the first thing a quarterback has to learn is dont beat yourself and i think hes got that part pretty good hes gotta be more productive
2739107 weve gotta couple new ones coming in that have a whole lot of potential plus we got a pretty good nucleus coming back from last year
2739108 we have a lot of experience coming back on defense a lot of playmakers guys who want to make plays guys who want to give the offense great field position or score themselves
2739109 its not that our recruiting is bad but we meed a couple more big time players like charlie ward and warrick dunn playing for us
2739110 it doesnt bother me because what weve done lately we dont deserve to be up there
2739111 iraq and china are keen to show their cooperation by finalizing an agreement on developing the ahdab oil field

2739113 i am only this very day re emerging in the world and must see if my family and friends even remember what i was like when i was around
2739114 for abandoning their children six nights in a row in portugal
2739115 the case of the disappearance of madeleine mccann has many parallels with other cases where families have cried abduction when their infant child has gone missing only for us all to find out later that the child has died at the hands of the parents whether accidentally negligently or intentionally
2739116 not long after wed met henri said to me you really should give up karate i hadnt even told her i went to karate classes but i took no notice and promptly dislocated my shoulder that night then there was the time miramax gave me a lot of money for the film rights to one of my novels and henri said rather disparagingly it will never be a miramax film which turned out to be true unfortunately of course shes not a hundred per cent accurate shes not a mainframe computer but shes often uncannily and annoyingly right which is why although shes utterly unworldly she has an impressive client list i know for a fact that she sees a lot of other writers and plenty of publishing executives as well
2739117 six children later she deserted to lesbos and shared the last thirty years of her life and a large four poster bed with lucy tait daughter of the previous archbishop of canterbury
2739118 of mrs bensons children none married none reproduced the species and all were happier in the company of their own sex

2739121 well at least weve got a barrister in the family now
2739122 i know a lot of what we wrote upset spacey fans but this kind of delusional adoration usually by atheists ironically should not be encouraged and i think spacey himself would agree with that
2739123 wacky gimmicks are easy that said i must repeat one of the characters channels a space alien through a hand puppet he wears at all times im not saying you have to love that but its pretty hard not to
2739124 jeez kevin calling you an asshole would be a huge understatement wouldnt it

2739168 these series of publications under the general title allgemeine naturgeschichte der fische berlin 1781 95 12 vols provided with 432 excellent plate illustrations formed the principal work on ichthyology in the eighteenth century but this great work which bloch began to publish at his own expense would not have been finished were it not for the enthusiasm that the enterprise roused throughout germany it being regarded as almost a national affair so much so indeed that all the princes and patrons of science participated in the publication expenses of the last six volumes each plate bearing the name of the person at whose cost it had been prepared

2739217 russia has shown itself capable of crossing every line in this conflict
2739218 we are willing to do cease fire immediately providing the other side stops to shoot and to bomb
2739219 that makes it clear that the targets of the russian military were not only georgian economic objects but international objects on georgian territory

2739226 the most prominent us moves in the caucasus are the decision to dispatch military advisers to georgia and a march 29 state department announcement on the lifting of an arms embargo imposed on armenia and azerbaijan both actions have the potential to tilt the military establishments of all three caucasus nations away from russia and towards nato

2739233 in addition to the spy drones israel has also been supplying georgia with infantry weapons and electronics for artillery systems and has helped upgrade soviet designed su 25 ground attack jets assembled in georgia according to koba liklikadze an independent military expert based in tbilisi former israeli generals also serve as advisers to the georgian military

2739416 inflexibilidad y rigidez laboral merma los resultados de las empresas y aumenta el absentismo de los empleados
2739417 el primer paso para poder cambiar la cultura presencial es que exista voluntad por ambas partes de querer conversar sobre el asunto
2739418 el empleado tiene que tratar de empatizar con su jefe dejando de lado su actitud de v ctima para exponer de forma proactiva y positiva sus sugerencias al respecto
2739419 el l der precisamente por su posici n es el responsable de crear a trav s de la comunicaci n relaciones humanas mejores que a su vez generan resultados empresariales excelentes
2739420 demasiadas compa as espa olas est n apegadas por rutina e inercia a la cultura de ver qui n se va el ltimo postergando su vuelta a casa
2739421 en los pa ses m s avanzados de europa apenas se trabaja m s all de las cinco o las seis de la tarde y su productividad es mayor que la nuestra
2739422 la cultura de la presencia aumenta el absentismo f sico que en espa a ronda el 4 1 y tiene un coste de 652 millones de euros al a o seg n un informe de pricewaterhouse coopers tambi n fomenta el absentismo emocional que se podr a definir como estar en el trabajo pero sin estar algo dif cil de cuantificar
2739423 el coste de la no conciliaci n siempre es superior al de la puesta en marcha de medidas que fomenten la racionalidad de los horarios y la flexibilidad laboral
2739424 entonces apostamos por promover una cultura que fomentara el bienestar entre nuestros trabajadores delegando en ellos la responsabilidad de ser due os de su trabajo lo que a posteriori reverti muy positivamente en su compromiso y por ende en su productividad
2739425 al principio fue complicado de lidiar pero poco a poco se ha ido creando una cultura basada en la confianza mutua y la flexibilidad

2739472 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2739473 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2739474 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2739475 eu hesitei muito tinha medo de os brasileiros n o entenderem a proposta de n o quererem sair de casa para comer ovo e pagar quase r 30 por ele
2739476 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2739477 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2739478 hvad sagde to tredjedele af franske m nd og kvinder i 1997 at de tog mest afstand fra n st efter arabere
2739479 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2739480 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2739481 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2739504 whats the real reason that giving is declining in most churches today is it the economy
2739505 economic downturns do make religious people more conscientious about how and where they give and invest when wages are frozen commissions are smaller and prices are higher the coffers will be lighter thats a fact but the economy has very little to do with the decline in the number of coins that ring in todays coffers even when the economy was booming giving was waning giving has been declining for decades
2739506 a more important question is what motivates generosity at all
2739507 generosity is never tied to your circumstances but to your convictions if the economy had anything to do with giving the macedonians about whom saint paul wrote in sacred scripture had every reason to quarantine the meager resources they did have instead however and this is what shocked saint paul their generosity was outlandish
2739508 just as in macedonia this kind of outlandish generosity exists today
2739509 but it isnt because of sermons on tithing or the pulpit scolding of those who do not give if youre interest is in growing a spiritually healthy church motivation for giving must come from somewhere other than guilt for not giving or shame for giving too little
2739510 you never have to beg from people who have experienced grace
2739511 but you almost always have to beg from those who have not
2739512 if you find there is a decline in giving in your church look for a deficit of grace in peoples lives
2739513 it is there youll find the answers in your search for what motivates giving grace is the key that unlocks the door on the generosity quotient in a persons life

2739531 spewing venom does online anonymity enhance valuable forum or encourage posts that are rude crude hateful
2739532 some users and privacy activists like aclu believe that internet users deserve stronger pseudonymity so that they can protect themselves against identity theft illegal government surveillance stalking and other unwelcome consequences of internet use including unintentional disclosures of their personal information their views are supported by laws in some nations such as canada that guarantee citizens a right to speak using a pseudonym 1 this right does not however give citizens the right to demand publication of pseudonymous speech on equipment they do not own
2739533 pseudonymity is an important component of the reputation systems found in online auction services such as ebay discussion sites such as slashdot and collaborative knowledge development sites such as wikipedia a pseudonymous user who has acquired a favorable reputation gains the trust of other reputable users when users believe that they will be rewarded by acquiring a favorable reputation they are more likely to behave in accordance with the sites policies
2739534 many people dont want the things they say online to be connected with their offline identities
2739535 a town crier with a voice that resonates farther than it could from any soapbox
2739536 t he free exchange of ideas on the internet is driven in large part by the ability of internet users to communicate anonymously
2739537 against the backdrop of first amendment protection for anonymous speech courts have held that civil subpoenas seeking information regarding anonymous individuals raise first amendment concerns
2739538 the constitutional rights of internet users including the first amendment right to speak anonymously must be carefully safeguarded
2739539 as a means of ensuring that plaintiffs do not use discovery procedures to ascertain the identities of unknown defendants in order to harass intimidate or silence critics in the public forum opportunities presented by the internet
2739540 people are permitted to interact pseudonymously and anonymously with each other so long as those acts are not in violation of the law this ability to speak ones mind without the burden of the other party knowing all the facts about ones identity can foster open communication and robust debate
2739541 i f internet users could be stripped of that anonymity by a civil subpoena enforced under the liberal rules of civil discovery this would have a significant chilling effect on internet communications and thus on basic first amendment rights
2739542 the right to engage in anonymous communication is fundamental to a free society
2739543 its critical that judges resist attempts by anyone public officials especially to turn courtrooms into vehicles to harass and intimidate people out of speaking their minds thankfully court after court has recognized that a plaintiff doesnt have an automatic right to pierce anonymity just because he doesnt like what someone has said
2739544 powerful entities are learning that they can use the courts to silence their critics when individuals choose to participate in a public debate anonymously they should not have to worry that their identities will be divulged to anyone who doesnt like what they have to say
2739545 anonymous speech is part of a vaunted american tradition that goes back to the founders who often published unsigned political pamphlets
2739546 yet on the internet citizens are forced to depend on web sites or isps to protect their anonymity
2739547 anonymous speech on the internet lets people make criticisms that are difficult to state openly and share information and support about topics that might be stigmatizing such as addiction or sexual abuse
2739548 unless online anonymity is protected whistleblowers who want to criticize their employers parents who want to criticize the principal of their childrens school and many others may be afraid to speak out that would be a loss for our country
2739549 in their brief filed today the aclu and eff argue that the court should adopt the same test currently used to determine whether to compel identification of anonymous sources of journalists or members of private organizations under that test the court must first determine whether the person seeking the protected private information in this case 2themart com has a genuine need for the information in the context of the case and cannot discover the information any other way if so the court must then balance the harm to the anonymous speakers against the plaintiffs need to discover the identity of the speaker anonymity should be preserved unless the identity of the anonymous person is clearly shown to be of central importance to the case

2739565 she used to be a real party girl when she wasnt out at nightclubs she was taking acting classes we dated for only a few months but in that period i spent a lot of time with her and her friends whose behavior intrigued and appalled me to such an extent that i ended up basing a novel on the experience it was narrated in the first person from the point of view of an ostensibly jaded sexually voracious 20 year old who was inspired by lisa i certainly thought of alison poole as a sympathetic and ultimately endearing character

2739607 i dont think seismicity has been all that low in southern california the weve had m3ish quakes near the border and near taft
2739608 but the aftershock sequence from the m5 4 itself turns out to be wimpy about 75 percent less energetic than the average california aftershock sequence for a m5 4 mainshock theres some indication that relatively deeper quakes have relatively fewer aftershocks chino hills wasnt hugely deep but at 14km it was deeper than some
2739609 making this flight would be the culmination of every dream i have had since childhood
2739610 i remember spinning round and round holding a little model rocket in my hands with a tape recording of a launch playing in the background imagining it was me on top of that rocket soaring into space
2739611 i think feeling weightlessness again coupled with looking back down at our beautiful fragile earth will pour emotion from every pore of my being
2739612 it has to be one of the most humbling experiences on earth
2739613 various landmarks in the united states including new york city
2739614 chemical substances in gel and liquid form that were sealed in bottles and glass jars
2739615 the united states did not have knowledge of her whereabouts until she was detained by the afghan police on july 17
2739616 ms siddiqui was not in custody of the united states either at bagram air base in afghanistan or anywhere else at any time prior to her detention on july 17
2739617 any rumors or allegations to the contrary are absolutely baseless and without any credible foundation whatsoever
2739618 the islamic revolutionary guards corps has recently tested a naval weapon with a 300 km range in which no vessel would be safe and would be sent to the depths
2739619 enemies know that we are easily able to block the strait of hormuz for unlimited period
2739620 the strait and vessels are in range of our various weapons
2739621 in view of the proximity of the strait of hormuz to our shores this distance is within the range of an assortment of weapons and its closure for us is very feasible and we face no limitations from the point of view of time
2739622 who the hell are you besides a busy body bureaucrat
2739623 it is inexcusable for us taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
2739624 were dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction and relatively soon
2739625 in the ecstatic cries i heard chinese peoples longing for recognition and respect from the world
2739626 i want foreigners to see what china has achieved we were called the sick man of asia now we are strong and rich enough to hold such a major international event
2739627 congress never makes good policy decisions in the heat of a crisis
2739628 there is no doubt that current oil prices incorporate a substantial political risk premium
2739629 every time bush threatens iran by saying that all options are on the table including the military one oil spikes
2739630 prices would go a lot higher and stay there too if the market really believed that an attack on iran were imminent
2739631 both obama and mccain are trying to force short term knee jerk responses
2739632 citing most of the same evidence that i have written about over the past few weeks washington post columnist david ignatius whose access to key policymakers outside of vice president dick cheneys office is second to no other washington daily journalist argues in his sunday column that the bush administration is unlikely to bomb iran before it leaves office
2739633 being trained to use less by increasing prices for the good of
2739634 congress has been notified by a defense panel that israel has requested purchase of double the amount of jet fuel jp 8 it purchased last year
2739635 on july 11 the defense security cooperation agency notified congress of a possible foreign military sale to the government of israel of unleaded gasoline jp 8 aviation jet fuel and diesel fuel the total value if all options are exercised could be as high as 1 3 billion the government of israel has requested a possible sale of 28 000 000 gallons of unleaded gasoline 186 000 000 gallons of jp 8 aviation jet fuel and 54 000 000 gallons of diesel fuel the estimated cost is 1 3 billion jp 8 requests are not new but the size of the buy is impressive in july 2006 israel requested up to 210 dollars worth of jp 8 in september 2004 israel requested up to 102 million dollars worth of jp 8
2739636 one of mullens hosts noted at the end of the visit that even though israel defense forces chief of staff gabi ashkenazi and the other senior officers did not discuss operational coordination it was mentioned during discussions that both sides would like to avoid mistaken confrontations of the sort that led to the idf attack against the u
2739637 mike mcconnell the director of national intelligence traveled to israel in early june he was followed in late june by adm
2739638 we have made our position abundantly clear to the israelis and indeed to the world not just in our public statements but in our private conversations as well
2739639 contrary to popular belief high gasoline prices are good and they are good precisely because high oil prices are very bad
2739640 there is though another oddity in this story in the jp the jewish
2739641 i speak to you not as a candidate for president
2739642 cristol s jewish identity is important to his writing the book about the liberty and because as far as i know you have to be jewish or an israeli jew to be in the idf and cristol was a idf fighter pilot in israel maybe i should have just said he was formerly a israeli idf fighter pilot instead of identifying him as an american jew
2739643 as i asked do you not find this mention of the 40 year old liberty incident odd coming at this time and why would cristol be in israel at this late date lecturing the israeli forces on the liberty
2739644 i also believe that the chinese people are watching very carefully about the decisions by world leaders and i happen to believe not going to the opening ceremony for the games would be an affront to the chinese people which may make it more difficult to be able to speak frankly with the chinese leadership
2739645 the japanese leaders decision to attend the opening ceremony is a gesture to safeguard the warming trend of sino japan relations
2739646 they want to see whether chinese are warm and friendly
2739647 these elements make the beijing 2008 olympic games influential and historic
2739648 on april 21 mr saakashvili called the russian leader to demand that he reverse the decision possible russian recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia he reminded mr putin that the west had taken georgia s side in the dispute and mr putin according to several of mr saakashvili s associates shot back with a suggestion about where they could put their statements mr saakashvili prudent for once shied from uttering the exact wording but said that mr putin had used extremely offensive language and had repeated the expression several times
2739649 the brave plucky georgians cruelly crushed by the russian bear
2739650 remains unknown although estimates range from several hundred to several thousand
2739651 no doubt when the chinese government has finished dealing with its people the tidy square will be presented again as a suitable site for tourists visiting dignitaries and the chinese public to come honor the heroes of chinas glorious revolution
2739652 trying to imagine the olympic torch lit in beijing i keep remembering another torch put there not at the behest of the communist regime but by the protesters who nearly 12 years ago rose up by the millions to defy chinas tyranny
2739653 it is vital soldiers know that if something happens to them there is someone who will make every effort bring them back
2739654 we hope we can bring an end to this episode just like we returned eldad regev and ehud goldwasser
2739655 the judge believed it was enough the period that he served in prison
2739656 they have released him and he is on his way home
2739657 jury in guantanamo today reflects extremely well on the six officers given the unenviable task of participating in a badly flawed system
2739658 whether hamdan should ultimately have been convicted or not there does seem to be sufficient information in the public record to justify his indefinite detention as a member of a force hostile to the united states engaged in a conflict against it
2739659 what i am concerned about right now is not the banks but how much our foreign exchange reserves have held bonds for the two american firms
2739660 the key is to establish a cautious mechanism a system that watches out for economic cycles
2739661 vamos a intentar detener esta matanza proponiendo el cese de los combates y la retirada de las tropas de una parte y de otra tras las l neas establecidas por la comunidad internacional
2739662 para que se alcance una tregua y los combates cesen
2739663 est claro que el conflicto se extiende ahora a otras regiones de georgia en particular a abjasia
2739664 los ataques a reos rusos contra el territorio georgiano tiene que cesar inmediatamente
2739665 si la escalada peligrosa y desproporcionada de su parte contin a tendr un impacto significativo a largo plazo en las relaciones ruso estadounidenses
2739666 acaben las operaciones militares y que nos abstengamos de represalias que podr an degenerar en un conflicto a n m s importante
2739667 la reanudaci n decidida de la v a de las negociaciones y del di logo
2739668 if this disaster was triggered by climbers being stranded above the bottleneck after a collapsing serac took out the fixed ropes then i cant think of a comparable death trap in mountaineering history
2739669 people at base camp saw me go over the wrong side of the ridge and they radioed people in camp iv i had to sit out a whiteout because i couldnt see anything and i knew i couldnt go down any further so i waited for a few hours and then i saw through the clouds that i could go down on an easier glacier
2739670 estados unidos estar furioso si se confirma que aviones rusos bombardearon una base donde el pent gono ten a consejeros militares
2739671 un presidente al final de su reinado no va a arriesgarse con la tercera guerra mundial por georgia
2739672 los rusos penetraron en el territorio georgiano y esto es muy real pero yo no creo que el objetivo de los rusos sea destruir completamente las capacidades militares de georgia es una demostraci n rusa para debilitar la capacidad de los georgianos
2739673 la escalada militar es posible pero no estoy segura que sea inevitable porque nadie est realmente interesado rusia no est interesada en una escalada de violencia sencillamente porque hay un c ucaso del sur pero tambi n un c ucaso del norte con riesgo de contagiarse de engranaje
2739674 ni la uni n europea ni estados unidos quieren enviar fuerzas a la regi n
2739675 un caso entre georgia y osetia del sur como entre estados unidos y rusia
2739676 rusia se opone violentamente a que georgia se convierta en miembro de la otan y estados unidos lleg a enfrentarse con rusia por este tema
2739677 si georgia cae bajo influencia rusa las esperanzas europeas de una independencia energ tica de rusia desaparecer n
2739678 clearly there have been incidents on both sides but this is obviously a planned georgian operation a contingency plan they have had for some time to retake south ossetias capital tskhinvali
2739679 possibly the georgians calculated that with putin in beijing they could recapture the capital in two days and then defend it over the next two months because the russians wont take this lying down
2739680 russia should not be blamed for the fighting but russia should now be pressured not to go beyond its peacekeeping mandate and to ensure that armed militia do not cross the border into south ossetia
2739681 this pushed georgia into a philosophy of self reliance the idea that georgia will be able to regain breakaway entities only by its own means
2739682 the elephant in the room behind this whole story is georgias nato prospects
2739683 it might be a signal to the russians saying that the sochi olympics will not go the way russia wants if there is no progress on the settlement in abkhazia
2739684 and taken to tbilisis notorious isolator number 7 the scene of well documented torture of political prisoners since 1991
2739685 the style of saakashvilis governance has made dishonesty injustice and oppression a way of life everyday repression demolition of houses and churches robbery kulakization and murders i would stress murders have become common practice for the authorities
2739686 its about america its values we are a freedom loving nation that is right now under attack
2739687 oh sorry we destroyed your city and killed all those people in such a gruesome way when we really didnt have to hey could you pass me that stapler
2739688 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
2739689 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
2739690 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
2739691 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis
2739692 a self righteous one way legal moral screen with positive images of western values and innocence portrayed as threatened validating a campaign of unrestricted violence
2739693 if jesus wants me to be a lawyer hell give me the answers for the tests
2739694 how does it become a man to behave toward this american government to day i answer that he cannot without disgrace be associated with it
2739695 what is the price current of an honest man and patriot today they hesitate and they regret and sometimes they petition but they do nothing in earnest and with effect they will wait well disposed for others to remedy the evil that they may no longer have it to regret
2739696 its about america its values we are a freedom loving nation that is right now under attack
2739697 your ballroom days are over baby night is drawing near shadows of the evening crawl across the years
2739698 nato is perceived by russia and very justifiably so in my opinion as being simply a vehicle for the us to advance its interests by threatening and encircling russia
2739699 there are far more far smarter and more realistic ways to address security concerns than belligerence military aggression war and missiles
2739700 do you not see that the attempt to denude russia of its historical provinces is a provocation that stands as a prelude to war
2739701 get your head out of the ethnic grudge book and take a look around
2739702 no i would not want the heirs of the duchy of muscovy telling me what to do if i were in the shoes of any people who had been abused by the ambitions of that ancient imperial state i think we will all grant that but that is not the issue here
2739703 if your argument is sincere you are naive chris seemed to think your argument was disingenuous which is it
2739704 there are other serious problems with carsons stances he seems to revel in victim avenging the way the far right israelis do when they talk about the holocaust implying that it is their right to get revenge and to be as bloody as necessary
2739705 he also makes a mistake when he advances that joining nato will make georgia safe
2739706 other problems regard his knowledge of the situation of kosovo contrary to what he claims muslims were not simply victims
2739707 then carson makes a very wild claim this one brutal repression from several years ago a repression that is over in a country that is supposed to be safe in the hands of the un troops peacekeepers makes it necessary now for kosovo to be declared an independant state again this shows an utter lack of knowledge about the reality of the situation as well as a serious problem in the logic department
2739708 i do not know all the events the number of dead people or the chronology
2739709 if kosovo must be declared independent it is most assuredly not because muslims oughta have a safe place to live it is rather to be in tune with the victim avenging dogma that carson and so many others fall for
2739710 unless of course you actually mean that serbs are bloody killers who just could never coexist with muslims
2739711 why should we outright discard its decisions and instead focus on what people in the neighboring countries want they are puppets and proxies to the us this is how they are considered this is not how we consider them
2739712 why should we outright discard its decisions and instead focus on what people in the neighboring countries want
2739713 kosovos independence was made necessity by ethnic cleansing by serbs the georgians havent been ethnic cleansing in south ossettia two different cases and one set of muslims who evidently dont count
2739714 i and the others i believe call naive anyone who thinks the us places value on these countries
2739715 well i did not feel i was telling them what to do but rather i gave my opinion on what they should do if they wanted peace
2739716 i dont know enough about the history of those attacks you constantly talk about
2739717 go back to the interventionist crowd and leave us alone
2739718 a decent thinker will assess everyones concerns instead of assigning the bad guy role to one so as to focus only on the other
2739719 you simply compared them to bullying parents and implied that they could not help but bully kill muslims therefore making it impossible to give them a state
2739720 when i said i did not know all the facts the number of dead people and the chronology of the events that wasnt an admission of ignorance but a simple attempt at humility if you crush even this with condescension do not expect others to reply to you
2739721 over and above the 750m already pledged was accorded during talks after meeting karzai in the indian capital new delhi on monday
2739722 iraq and china are keen to show their cooperation by finalizing an agreement on developing the ahdab oil field
2739723 we expect the death toll to rise because rescue workers have just begun to reach affected areas where communication was very limited
2739724 we have mobilized militiamen and soldiers to rush food aid to people
2739725 they are totally no good because they are only working for certain people

2739734 its a shame for us filipinos that we could not take care of our own people
2739735 after looking back it looks like god is with cmm
2739736 they give their time free so that we can give them some target money and take care of their transportation
2739737 we become friends every year its just like a family reunion
2739738 christians and muslims get along and were serving both well see that our faiths are no different we serve the same god
2739739 in the daily clinics youll see an average of 1 000 a day in five days we served about 5 000 people so we got a good look at what the health issues and living conditions are
2739740 for me it defines my legacy obviously all of us have one to leave in this world and service to mankind i think would be one of the best ones we could leave
2739741 every man and woman is born into the world to do something unique and something distinctive and if he or she does not do it it will never be done
2739742 you know it just goes to show that god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2739743 as you know i feel very strongly about religion and i am so appreciative of the chance to go to church here in your society
2739744 bush told president hu that this is an important aspect of the u s china dialogue and that the chinese can expect that any future american president will also make it an important aspect of our dialogue
2739745 i think president hu was saying youve gone to church today and youve seen christians worshiping openly in our society
2739746 i took it to mean that i think in the future there will be more room for christians and other religious groups in this society
2739747 we firmly oppose any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs using human rights and religion and other issues

2739800 landowners are not attracted by the 20 million they are insulted by it
2739801 al staymen a key staff person with the us senate energy committee put the december 18 deadline in the original act law and he can remove it more simply than we can change the moura
2739802 weve been very forthcoming with the us about working to get agreement with the landowners
2739803 an imaginative way to try to break the impasse over the lua
2739804 it was pretty incredible how fast the mustang was going
2739805 thats when everybody started running because we didnt know how fast the van was going to spin out of control
2739806 we believe there were significant problems in some of the subprime loans made in the last few years
2739807 traditional counseling doesnt figure out whether the homeowner should have gotten the loan whether there was fraud or predatory lending
2739808 were trying to prevent that cycle from feeding on itself
2739809 some of the people dont have enough money with gas and food prices going up
2739810 i see people who lost their jobs people whose interest rates have gone up some who just had bad budgeting
2739811 i dont think this program is going to resolve the foreclosure problem
2739812 in those areas im expecting to see more of a consistent uptick
2739813 im worth 50 million obama and his wife are never going to make it to the white house he needs to be taken out that man will never know what hit him i just may do that ive got the money and the clout
2739814 you have more officers out there engaging and initiating more activities
2739815 when you increase enforcement you generally encounter more opportunities for force
2739816 frankly the use of force has been an issue here for some time
2739817 i want our people to look at these and see what was driving this increase
2739818 these are all just numbers now we have to do some further investigation to see what they mean
2739819 the big question is did they use the force that needed to be used
2739820 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2739821 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2739822 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2739823 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2739824 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2739825 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2739826 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2739827 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2739828 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2739829 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2739830 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2739831 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2739832 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2739833 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2739834 vielen dank f r die einladung liebe eule tm hast du den kuchen selbst gebacken
2739835 yeah now move your fingers along the front wall you can feel around a bit if you would like
2739836 we could get into a 69 with me on top
2739837 rose i need you to shift a leg for a second so i can get my arms back behind you
2739838 tom be gentle and make sure you have enough lube on your fingers
2739839 as you enter work your fingers on the upper wall of my vagina like this
2739840 how do you want to try intercourse for this first time
2739841 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
2739842 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient
2739843 across ten other associations with a similar membership profile just three others offer online learning and they are all offering webinars none are currently offering stand alone asynchronous options our association would be the first in our profile to offer such a course
2739844 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2739845 when the military says robot they mean everything from self driving trucks up to what you would conventionally think of as a robot you would more accurately call them autonomous systems rather than robots
2739846 its a chain of command thing you dont want to give autonomy to a weapons delivery system you want to have a human hit the button
2739847 you dont want the robot to make the wrong decision you want to have a human to make all of the important decisions
2739848 its oftentimes like the difference between the adverb and noun you can act intelligently or you can be intelligent im much more interested in the adverb for my robots
2739849 when i envision the future of robots i always think of the jetsons
2739850 george jetson never sat down at a computer to task rosie to clean the house somehow they had this local exchange of information so what weve been working on is how we can use the local environment rather than a computer as a tasking medium to the robot
2739851 we forget that when were controlling robots in the lab its really pretty safe and no ones trying to kill us
2739852 but if you are in a war zone and youre hunched over a laptop thats not a good place to be you want to be able to use your eyes in one place and use your hand to control the robot without tying up all of your attention
2739853 nvidia control panel application has encountered a problem and needs to close

2739858 on sait tr s bien que le 40e mondial peut gagner aujourdhui
2739859 je commence bien je vois que mon adversaire change parce quil est un peu perdu quil na pas de solutions il ne se prend pas la t te il va tout droit il simplifie ses attaques et moi je sais ce quil faut faire je vois les moments o il faut que je parte mais je ny vais pas je ne me l che pas
2739860 du moins pas celles quil attend celles quil avait avant les europe et lors des derniers jours de la pr paration

2739865 yet according most national surveys obama only leads john mccain by a few points
2739866 he has to convince people besides those already drooling over his idol image that he is an american dedicated to traditional american values
2739867 get your mind off of that bimbo madonna and concentrate on baseball
2739868 paul blair leads the inning off with a single giving the yankees life
2739869 and freddie patek is literally crying his eyes out in the dugout
2739870 get your mind off of that bimbo madonna and concentrate on baseball
2739871 paul blair leads the inning off with a single giving the yankees life
2739872 and freddie patek is literally crying his eyes out in the dugout
2739873 three years on and we still dont have any justice for thomas
2739874 we have put our faith in the justice system but it has failed us to date
2739875 what kind of message is this giving to thomas friends and the young people of this new northern ireland
2739876 one man has been charged in relation to the attack on thomas and his friends but this is a very light charge
2739877 the police have worked hard on the investigation and we know they are also unhappy with the pps direction
2739878 the director has agreed to undertake a review of the decision not to prosecute
2739879 the pps has met the family of thomas devlin on a number of occasions over recent months furthermore the pps has written to the family on friday in relation to concerns which they have raised about the decision not to prosecute
2739880 the pps are so cautious in their approach compared to england and this is so frustrating
2739881 the cps will also discuss cases with investigating officers but the pps dont do it and its hard to understand why this is the case
2739882 we have looked at many cases in england including the murder of rhys jones where many people have been charged from murder to assisting offenders and this is the justice that we are seeking
2739883 the cps will charge someone with murder if they are accused of being at the scene but havent pulled the trigger for example why is this joint enterprise policy not used in northern ireland
2739884 the people who murdered my son are still walking the streets and thats why we have formally requested for the pps ruling to be reviewed by an independent qc who has experience of similar cases our request has been noted and we are now just waiting for a response
2739885 three years on and people are still not telling the truth of over thomas murder
2739886 these people have the information that could put my sons killers behind bars but they are still remaining silent
2739887 by remaining silent they are just as culpable as the men who murdered my son
2739888 these people should remember that withholding information is a very serious offence
2739889 we are asking them to search their conscience and come forward because its never to late
2739890 having spoken to the chairman of the referees association david malcolm we have moved on significantly and i can confirm that the referees will resume their duties and the new premiership season will start on saturday
2739891 there will be no more meetings with the referees association concerning money
2739892 they have got what they want its simply regrettable it had to come to this
2739893 i have told david to leave everything in my hands and i will dot the is and cross the ts
2739894 were hoping from september 1 to be starting a pilot scheme for assistant referees running the line and this seems agreeable
2739895 im just annoyed i wasnt involved in these discussions from an earlier stage than thursday
2739896 if i had have been then i would have been confident football would have been played yesterday
2739897 thats why on this embarrassing issue there must be a de briefing i will be ordering an investigation into the matter if a letter came into this association four months ago from the referees what happened during that time
2739898 yes it can be a laborious process at the irish fa but i as president want answers and you can be rest assured this type of thing will never happen again i will not allow it
2739899 however we should not be conducting a blame game rather i would like to think the irish fa as a whole will learn from this
2739900 so much hard work has been put into this league and even though it will now go ahead on saturday everybody had been looking forward to the league starting on august 9
2739901 the senior clubs committee did everything in their power to try and sort out the problem but with no say over the intermediate committee our hands were tied
2739902 the referees knew our position and despite saying we couldnt do any more for them they still went ahead with the strike as they were dealing with the demands collectively
2739903 i want an investigation into this matter and will also be asking for a change so that each tier of football is dealt with seperately we cant have this happening again
2739904 im so so sorry for everybody involved and am absolutely gutted
2739905 he never misses a beat never wastes a motion nor fails to deliver a stunning narrative that rises and falls with each execution
2739906 this show should be seen by many it is a difficult subject matter handled well dont miss it
2739907 its about a guy who kills paedophile priests the psychological journey of a man who because of a horrific experience he had as a child in a small town goes on to start killing priests
2739908 at the moment we are looking to do a tour in the spring i am actually going to be speaking to some venue managers over here so that they can see the show and then we will see where we go from there
2739909 the critical information they really need is recent sightings that would suggest where madeleine is now
2739910 she is a stranger she took me from my mummy
2739911 after what they have been through i know they have the courage to do anything
2739912 i met suzanne and michelle and i also met pauline green i spent over five hours with them and their families had private chats with each of the girls and answered any questions they had about their artificial limbs
2739913 i told them how i carried on with my life after losing my leg and how they could enjoy life again as difficult as it may seem after the tragedy of omagh
2739914 i have learned to ski swim and snowboard and only having one real leg hasnt stopped me achieving my dreams
2739915 i counsel hundreds of amputees and their families and a common question is will i be even less attractive to the opposite sex
2739916 i told them it was all about confidence and that was one of the most attractive features in anyone there was no reason for these girls to feel any less attractive than before
2739917 there are a million things out there that they can do well if not better than anyone else
2739918 losing a leg need not be a disability to them
2739919 i told them they could still do anything they used to do and not to let anyone try to change their minds
2739920 i had worked on the frontline in the former yugoslavia and had seen on many occasions families lives torn apart and how the community came together and helped each other heal through time and connection
2739921 it is impossible to celebrate the anniversary of a terrible act of terrorism the courage the people of omagh have shown and the overcoming of adversity however is definitely something to celebrate
2739922 however the lives lost can never be replaced and we pray and hope that some lessons have been learned so their deaths were not in vain
2739923 the chief executive of the council peter mcnaney and gerry lennon of the belfast visitors and convention centre wanted the former lord mayor to sign off on the logo but he categorically refused they were gobsmacked
2739924 instead of giving his seal of approval councillor rodgers stood up and said hed listened to the views of people from the working groups and it was clear they werent happy he said more work needed to be done
2739925 it was very embarrassing news of what had happened spread like wildfire around the council
2739926 theres not words to describe that boy he was very kind and did everything for me he was like the man of the house because me and his dad are divorced
2739927 he would go around the neighbourhood helping people he would sit and listen to people who had depression or people who were alcoholics and help them clean the house
2739928 he would come in and say are you all right mum and give my head a pat
2739929 i told him not to worry about that our last conversation was good i told him how proud i was of him
2739930 maybe he was going to find out if there was a bomb he said ill see you in a minute
2739931 i went into the salad bowl i had tomatoes in my hand and i was giving the boy the money and i thought i think theres a bomb here im getting alan and im getting out of here
2739932 just at that there was an unearthly bang i thought i was dreaming it blew me back to the middle of the shop
2739933 i still had the tomatoes in my hand because once i got outside i saw bits of bodies limbs or something and i dropped the tomatoes with the scare
2739934 as the day went on i began to get really worried i was so worried i couldnt move i was paralysed with fear
2739935 my son pauls dog started howling and i thought alans dead it was the way the dog was howling i thought does he see him
2739936 i heard alan call mum i know that without a doubt i sat up in bed looking for him
2739937 when i went into the bedroom a sense of peace came over me i had an idea he was dead i believe he called me from where he was i had that quite a lot after he died
2739938 it was definitely alans voice people probably think youre crazy but i know what i heard thats always been a comfort for me
2739939 i remember alan every day not every year or 10 years the pain is there
2739940 i have had a really bad spell of depression at the moment this is one of the lowest spells ive had since alan died
2739941 im not sleeping well only about three or four hours a night sometimes ive bad dreams that would wake me theyre about horrible things murder and bad people my minds obviously disturbed
2739942 when i come off anti depressants i cry all the time and take panic attacks
2739943 i think some day i will make a fresh start out of here i would have to think about it very carefully because i would be leaving family
2739944 i dont know what will happen i dont think you can go back in life you have to go forward
2739945 os estados unidos ficar o furiosos se os avi es russos bombardearem uma base onde o pent gono tem conselheiros militares
2739946 mas george w bush um presidente em fim de mandato n o vai querer arriscar uma terceira guerra mundial por causa da ge rgia
2739947 os russos invadiram o territ rio georgiano e isso algo real mas n o creio que o objetivo deles seja destruir completamente as capacidades militares da ge rgia uma demonstra o russa para enfraquecer a capacidade dos georgianos
2739948 a escalada militar poss vel mas n o estou certa que seja inevit vel porque ningu m est realmente interessado a r ssia n o est interessada numa escalada da viol ncia porque al m do c ucaso do sul h tamb m um c ucaso do norte com risco de expans o da crise
2739949 nem a uni o europ ia nem os estados unidos querem enviar for as militares regi o
2739950 um caso entre a ge rgia e a oss tia do sul quanto entre estados unidos e r ssia
2739951 a r ssia se op e violentamente ao fato de que a ge rgia se converta em membro da otan e os estados unidos chegaram a enfrentar a r ssia em rela o a este tema

2739958 you know what i find interesting men by far exist in a privileged position in this world and yet they are assigned responsibility for very little women who exist as marginalized bodies with limited access to power are to blame for everything does anyone not see something slightly off about this way of ordering society power with out responsibility would never be deemed acceptable in the business world where money is at risk but when it comes to our social discourse we blindly give men a free pass without forcing them to own any of their privileges
2739959 is benjamin claiming that women who werent prostitutes any longer deserved to be left alone because they were trying to clean up their act but those who were still working in the sex industry shouldnt have been spared the attention i would say all of her former employees should have been excluded from the humiliating spectacle regardless of what theyre doing with their life at present
2739960 want to fight oppression of women then fight by ending oppression not by making enemies of those who are not enemies forget the apostasy forget the heresy just deal with the fucking real world issues like hiv prevention educating against sexual violence
2739961 many of us simply just act as if we and our blogs are media
2739962 let the books speak for themselves if you dont want your kid to read a book because of the authors post publication actions then dont buy it but you should get to decide what is suitable for your child not the publisher
2739963 the industry needs an overhaul sexist stereotypical misogynistic portrayals of women abound in video games but guess what that isnt the fault of girl gamers thats the fault of a boys club industry which needs a short sharp kick to the behind meanwhile we will keep playing the good games and enjoying them too
2739964 marie had ordered it she wants me to help her to work her way through it weve been here before a new idea scheme therapy and it has come to naught but underlying this is the desire to improve life and the belief that it can be improved
2739965 my inference is that they concluded that this administration would not release hamdan at the end of his sentence but the next one might
2739966 i think hamdans continued detention past the end of his sentence although justifiable under the law of war would be a political train wreck and i think the panel made an effort to protect the u s from further international criticism
2739967 for seven years uniformed military officers have pushed back against the administrations most extreme and unlawful detention and interrogation policies only to be overruled by white house lawyers with little respect for the constitution or geneva conventions
2739968 we may never know what the commission members were thinking but we saw what they did they ensured that mr hamdans fate will be determined by a future administration with more respect for the rule of law
2739969 holding hamdan past the end of his term is only going to further inflame anti american feelings in the muslim world where the u s will clearly be perceived as continuing to discriminate on the basis of nationality or religion
2739970 due to inflation we either have to make new bank notes and coins or introduce a new currency instead of the rial
2739971 we still work on the process but hope to finalize a new currency system within the next three months
