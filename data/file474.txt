4740207 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4740208 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4740209 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4740210 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4740211 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4740212 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4740213 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4740214 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4740215 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
4740216 urgente necesidad de respetar y promover los derechos intr nsecos de los pueblos ind genas que derivan de sus estructuras pol ticas econ micas y sociales y de sus culturas de sus tradiciones espirituales de su historia y de su concepci n de la vida especialmente los derechos a sus tierras territorios y recursos
4740217 celebrar n consultas y cooperar n de buena fe con los pueblos ind genas interesados por conducto de sus propias instituciones representativas a fin de obtener su consentimiento libre e informado antes de aprobar cualquier proyecto que afecte a sus tierras o territorios y otros recursos particularmente en relaci n con el desarrollo la utilizaci n o la explotaci n de recursos minerales h dricos o de otro tipo
4740218 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4740219 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4740220 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4740221 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4740222 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4740223 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4740224 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4740225 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4740226 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4740227 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4740228 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4740229 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4740230 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4740231 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
4740232 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4740233 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4740234 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
4740235 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4740236 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4740237 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4740238 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4740239 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4740240 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4740241 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4740242 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4740243 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4740244 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4740245 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4740246 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
4740247 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
4740248 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
4740249 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
4740250 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
4740251 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
4740252 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
4740253 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4740254 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4740255 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4740256 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4740257 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4740258 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4740259 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4740260 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4740261 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
4740262 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
4740263 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
4740264 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
4740265 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
4740266 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4740267 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4740268 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4740269 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4740270 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4740271 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4740272 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4740273 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4740274 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4740275 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4740276 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4740277 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4740278 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4740279 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4740280 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4740281 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4740282 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4740283 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4740284 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4740285 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4740286 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4740287 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4740288 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4740289 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4740290 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4740291 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4740292 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile

4740294 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
4740295 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4740296 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4740297 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4740298 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4740299 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4740300 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche

4740303 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4740304 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4740305 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4740306 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4740307 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4740308 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4740309 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4740310 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4740311 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4740312 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4740313 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4740314 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4740315 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4740316 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4740317 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4740318 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4740319 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4740320 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4740321 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4740322 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4740323 police also confirmed it has been aired to 700 people as part of the inquiry but never released publicly as part of the investigative strategy until now due to concerns that to do so would narrow the focus of the inquiry
4740324 the claremont murders were one of the great tragedies of western australia and i live in claremont its my electorate i know the families i know the effect on them and i know the effect on the surrounding community
4740325 if it can help solve those crimes i would want all television outlets to have that footage
4740326 i think particularly the families but the whole community of western australia would desperately want to see those horrific crimes solved and whoever committed those crimes locked away forever
4740327 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4740328 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4740329 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4740330 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4740331 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4740332 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4740333 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4740334 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4740335 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4740336 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4740337 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4740338 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4740339 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4740340 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4740341 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4740342 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4740343 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4740344 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4740345 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4740346 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

4740353 they are in touch with the international federation to get all the facts
4740354 if im showing a picasso i want them to see a picasso
4740355 when youre down there in the trenches you see things that make you think this doesnt need to be done this way
4740356 if a guy did it he did it and needs to be done in for it
4740357 were not this blue brotherhood of the past where everyone turns their heads times have changed technology captures everything everything you say is recorded every stop you make is videotaped
4740358 if youre out there working and doing your job youre going to get complaints
4740359 have i been through the system ive had false complaints filed against me absolutely
4740360 we may pay for loss in money or repair or replace the damaged or stolen property
4740361 our limit of liability for loss will be the lesser of 1 the actual cash value of the stolen or damaged property 2 the amount necessary to repair or replace the property
4740362 i had to make sure the 1 was next to my name
4740363 it was a little bit of everything relief excitement everything
4740364 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time
4740365 hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time hes the greatest racer who ever walked the planet
4740366 i saw myself in his goggles and said you know im keeping this under control
4740367 in the last 15 meters there was just no point to look over i knew he was there
4740368 i just kind of saw a shadow in the side of my goggle i knew he was coming
4740369 when i made that final half stroke i thought id lost it there
4740370 but i guess that was the difference in the race im kind of at a loss for words
4740371 people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race
4740372 if we got to do this again i would win it
4740373 one day you know when people speak of michael phelps winning seven gold medals and having lost an opportunity to win eight gold medals theyll talk about whoever that guy is that took it away from him
4740374 and i think it would be good for him if he lost once just once
4740375 beforehand bob said it would be good for me if i lost
4740376 the intent of this ordinance is to smear protesters and make them appear as if theyre somehow criminal
4740377 successful aging is a lot of the time defined in terms of cognitive or physical functioning and its usually inevitable that those things will decline but this shows that the really key components of successful aging may be how happy you are and how satisfied you are with your life and these factors dont tend to decline with age

4740383 the last mile or last kilometer is the final leg of delivering connectivity from a communications provider to a customer usually referred to by the telecommunications and cable television industries it is typically seen as an expensive challenge because fanning out wires and cables is a considerable physical undertaking
4740384 so is it your gods fault that you forgot that thing
4740385 with the signing of this accord all russian troops and any paramilitary and irregular troops that entered with them must leave immediately
4740386 the verbal assurance that president dmitry medvedev gave that russian military operations had stopped clearly was not honored
4740387 yes ideally we would like a vote formalizing the ceasefire this weekend
4740388 but well take as long as it takes we are not going to push for a vote if we know that the russians will veto the text which does not mean we have to give in to all their demands there has to be hard bargaining
4740389 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4740390 moscow must honor its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4740391 a significant part of georgian territory remains under foreign military occupation
4740392 never ever will georgia reconcile itself with the occupation of even one square kilometer of its territory

4740399 in franta am parte de o pregatire profesionista in adevaratul sens al cuvantului in tara nu aveam program de odihna nu existau mese regulate pe cand aici totul este extrem de strict antrenament masa somn si iar antrenament in timpul saptamanii nu am liber deloc intrucat avem programate doua antrenamente zilnic sambata la ora 6 sunt la bazin pentru o sedinta de pregatire de trei ore si jumatate dupa care ma pot relaxa pana luni dimineata cand o iau de la capat tehnica de pregatire este si ea cu totul alta philippe este exigent dar asta numai la antrenamente si este normal sa fie asa pentru ca altfel nu ar fi performante
4740400 am progresat mult si asta se vede cu ochiul liber anul acesta am reusit nu mai putin de noua recorduri nationale varful de forma vreau sa l ating insa la beijing daca prind ziua si momentul voi fi din nou campioana olimpica

4740457 if we get the answers from them aqua well work with them 100 percent if not well look for other channels
4740458 i just want to clean the place up and make it look like a shopping center instead of a hitching post
4740459 once student enrollment settles often this is not until a week or two into the school year i will examine our needs as a total school facility and make decisions regarding how the mobile units can best accommodate these needs
4740460 it doesnt really matter who gets in the new president is in for a very hard time it doesnt take too many more hundreds of billions in bailouts to be more than the taxpayers can handle
4740461 private industry is where the innovations need to come from
4740462 obama is a great talker but can he lead congress into the right moves to salvage the economy
4740463 no matter who wins the november election the economy will not improve overnight
4740464 we must find a way for the national government as well as state and local government to cut out the wasteful spending bring jobs back to america and find alternative energy sources
4740465 i do not like the war stance of mccain but have economic issues with more government programs and other democrat obama economics
4740466 more government in our lives and erode freedoms plus we know what happens to programs run by the government
4740467 it appears that the past eight years have resulted in one of the worst economies in decades the highest deficit severely damaged international reputation and the lowest support for womens rights since the 1970s
4740468 a positive but short lived effect on our countrys economy
4740469 i have been a grocery shopper for 50 years and i am dismayed at how much prices are rising
4740470 something must be done and soon and i am not sure a new president is the answer i keep listening to mccain and obamas plans to help our economy but wonder just how much they can do
4740471 we are expecting a response from dot prior to the scheduled public hearing
4740472 our concern is that this is in strong contrast to what was recommended to us
4740473 its important that responsible development be applied you can get the golden egg and kill the goose that laid it in the process we want to make sure that beautiful northwest guilford county is preserved
4740474 traffic is already a big issue on 68 edgefield and pleasant ridge roads plus were worried about northwest schools already being overcrowded and clear cutting of trees to build
4740475 our hope is to have the area treated like oak ridge rather than treated like high point
4740476 why do they need to develop more in our area when there is already plenty of space available elsewhere all within minutes of the airport
4740477 what we felt were compromise conditions they really didnt meet any of them except what they would have had to meet anyway we are extremely disappointed with their lack of earnest compromise
4740478 what happens here will set the bar on what happens in this area in the next few years
4740479 although i am very pleased to hear him listening to those around him i saw several quotes from school board members and parents who praised him for saying i dont know and not having a ready made plan
4740480 personally im all for a ready made plan that includes giving back more power to teachers and principals incorporating the community in the schools finding ulterior means for educating students more interested in disrupting schools than planning for their future preventing and not merely handling violence in schools and bringing back skill classes like shop keyboarding and home ec for students not on a traditional college track
4740481 while it was nice to hear that mr green didnt think he had all the answers i would have been more confident if he had a firm vision of direction for guilford county schools
4740482 hopefully this will come after his 100 days of listening mr green will have to stand up and be a leader and hold people accountable
4740483 i think his lack of specifics and plans may be his greatest strength
4740484 mr greens biggest challenge will be to overcome the morale and intimidation issues and the lack of trust that the grier years have heaped upon our teachers
4740485 the meeting was an effort to get feedback from neighbors
4740486 it was an effort to get input on our plan in a collaborative manner
4740487 it is important that we try to address the concerns of our neighbors the community and the town of summerfield the meeting on the 31st was the first step in that process
4740488 just how many grocery stores do we need in this area anyway
4740489 we already have a walgreens going up 100 yards from a cvs with a food lion behind it i thought this was summerfield not wendover avenue
4740490 if it were flat i would be much less concerned but that septic field slopes downward and could seep into the water systems it just doesnt stand to reason that that would work
4740491 the developer said they did a traffic study and this development wouldnt impact traffic by more than about two seconds
4740492 we are clearly taking those comments seriously thats really the stage were in now with the planning process

4740498 im extremely satisfied and give my team full marks i feel that our mission has been accomplished because i treated todays match as a final
4740499 im very happy to have helped the country end its 48 year medal drought
4740500 i had to be patient and wait for opportunities to attack when everyone was nervous at the last moment staying calm was my advantage
4740501 its pity that we lost but we will try to get a bronze medal
4740502 we wont be overcautious because i believe the aggressive side will prevail
4740503 sildenafil is used for erectile dysfunction and can cause low blood pressure chest pain abnormalities of heart rhythm even stroke
4740504 were looking at this as a first stage review and depending on the results we might consider other locations
4740505 when someone has a stroke they have a probably a 20 per cent chance of dying from the stroke or a 20 to 30 per cent chance of being left totally disabled

4740511 the fans were fantastic to us on tuesday during the defeat by crawley we lost 3 0 but they were still clapping us off now we feel we owe them something on saturday
4740512 if we play like at forest green then i know we can go to places and pick up three points
4740513 if sides want to try to pass the ball around us theyre going to have to work very hard
4740514 theyve got almost a brand new set of players weve had them watched so we wont go in cold but itll be a little bit different
4740515 some teams pack their teams with big players and corners are a source of goals for them
4740516 we wanted an all green suit so that we werent visible we were very conscious of being visible in the water

4740520 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4740521 they accepted the ruling because it was not the human eye making the judgment
4740522 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4740523 there is no doubt the question was for him to share or not to share first place there is no doubt the first arrival was michael phelps
4740524 in the old days the judges ruled now its the timers
4740525 technology is also imperfect the hand is quicker than the eye
4740526 they couldnt believe phelps got there and im sure ill feel the same way
4740527 there hasnt really been an error in the timing system that ive ever heard of the scoreboard said i got my hand on the wall first
4740528 im not about fighting it im not angry at all
4740529 people will be bringing this up for years saying you won that race
4740530 if we got to do this again i would win it
4740531 all the things that im hearing are that they are going tomake those kind of recommendations
4740532 we should be able to appreciate the character of the moa the moa is a list of agreed points of the milf and the government
4740533 thats why its also included in the moa that every point should go through legal processes what is the legal process its congress
4740534 its an evolving process the moa ad is a document that is not final in the sense that its not implementable
4740535 it is not a self executing document its a document that is preparatory a codification of all the consensus of points so far agreed upon
4740536 the issue is now with the supreme court lets wait for its ruling and all will have to submit to it when it comes the highest tribunal is the final aribter it will rise above the din and noise created by less noble considerations
4740537 for all intents and purposes any proposal for charter change even if its forced will be dead

4740546 thats different from a place where you can sense healing right from the beginning
4740547 its here because our consumers are wanting it our consumers are asking these questions so we have to go out and find the answers for them
4740548 for the past two years crude has followed the dollar almost lock step
4740549 the strength weve seen in the dollar is almost certainly helping bring crude down at this point as you move backward it actually acts as a stimulus on the economy

4740574 computers in the future may weigh no more than 1 5 tons
4740575 i have travelled the length and breadth of this country and talked with the best people and i can assure you that data processing is a fad that wont last out the year
4740576 there is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home

4740578 windows nt addresses 2 gigabytes of ram which is more than any application will ever need
4740579 it is an extremely harsh and stark environment to detain people seeking asylum while their applications for protection are determined
4740580 the very expensive security systems of the facility are quite unnecessary for the population who may be detained there
4740581 the damage that has been done to peoples mental and physical health by detaining them in remote high security detention centres such as this has been documented repeatedly
4740582 the liberals will therefore legislate to bring in a requirement that elections be held in february or march every four years

4740587 my father was a colleague of known muslim league leaders like fazlul haq and husyn shaheed suhrawardy when they visited rajshahi they used to stay at our residence so i grew up in a dense political environment

4740589 there was freedom and a lot of work to do transport was cheap there was a tram service and there were friendly people all around i cannot recall a single calcutta street lane or by lane where i did not leave my footprints
4740590 calcutta and assam which we had always considered a part of the eastern wing of our new country pakistan went to india
4740591 there was a feeling that we had been robbed of a part of our victory but not the entire victory we had achieved something too
4740592 but the secession of bangladesh in 1971 was a full blown shock in which we lost everything
4740593 i spent three years at the parliament trying to tell the rulers they should not spend all the east pakistani money for development in west pakistan i tried to warn them that there was already smoke in east pakistan and there would soon be fire
4740594 the first thing i noticed here was that men looked at women with lust something i had never experienced in bengal and then there was bonded labour due to the domination of feudal lords
4740595 often i lie awake all night thinking about my life i have much to thank for but the divisions i have suffered hurt me they prick my heart

4740686 when you take xylitol the acid attack that would otherwise last for over half an hour is stopped because the bacteria in the mouth causing caries are unable to ferment xylitol in their metabolism their growth is reduced the number of acid producing lactobacilli and streptococci may fall as much as 90 no acid is formed because the ph of saliva and plaque does not fall after taking xylitol the bacteria do not adsorb well on the surface of the teeth and the amount of plaque decreases research has shown that the use of xylitol also helps correct incipient damage to the enamel saliva in itself protects the mouth and teeth stimulated saliva in particular contains all the components needed to correct incipient caries saliva containing xylitol is more alkaline than saliva stimulated by other sugar products after taking xylitol products the concentration of basic amino acids and ammonia in saliva and plaque may rise and plaque ph rises as well when ph is above 7 calcium and phosphate salts in saliva start to precipitate into those parts of enamel where they are lacking thus soft calcium deficient enamel sites begin to harden again

4740707 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4740708 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4740709 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4740710 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4740711 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4740712 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4740713 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4740714 rul ni kalian tau kan kalo tentara jepang udah pada kabur ke negeri asalnya
4740715 makanya potong rambut tuh kaya gue gaya orang asli amerika namanya mohawk kalo ini longlasting pemain bola aja ngikutin baidewei rul ni kita harus manfaatin kesempatan ini untuk menyatakan kemerdekaan kita
4740716 maksud loe kita akan culik ahmad dhani armand maulana ariel pasha sama kaka dan bim2
4740717 yeee itu sih pentolan group band lagian juga ahmad dhani kan proses cerainya belum selesai kasian maia kalo proses cerainya jadi ketunda lebih lama lagi eh kok jadi ngomongin gossip ehmm maksud gue yaitu bung karno dan bung hatta terus kita minta tebusan sama para tokoh lainnya kalo mereka ga penuhin permintaan kita 2 orang itu ga akan dipulang pulangin
4740718 emangnya apa penawaran kita supaya mereka mau nurutin permintaan kita
4740719 kita kasih pilihan kalo mereka masih mau selamat kasih kita uang 1 m atau cukup umumkan proklamasi kemerdekaan indonesia tapi gue masih bingung nih bagaimana ya cara nyuliknya
4740720 gue punya ide dam agar ga ada yang tahu kita menculik soekarno bagaimana kalo kita suruh si sukarni tidur di kasur soekarno hal ini akan mengakibatkan istrinya akan terkecoh dan mengira dia sukarno padahal sukarni terus dia akan tidur lagi lalu kita bisa culik soekarno dengan mudah
4740721 heeeehhhh eh gue cuma mirip nama bukan mirip muka loe kira maen plesetan
4740722 usul loe boleh juga oke setelah nyulik soekarno trus abis itu kita nyulik hatta buat bantu2 gue akan ajak juga temen2 laennya kaya si singgih si kunto sama si sulaeman tapi kayanya kita perlu nama deh buat tim ini biar kaya di pelm2 kan keren tuh kaya the a team delta force charlies angel angel lelga hmmm kira2 apa ya nama yang cocok buat tim kita
4740723 kita kan tinggal di menteng klo menurut gue bagaimana kalo namanya anak menteng aja
4740724 terus kostum kita kemeja yang dikancingin cuman kancing yang paling atas doang kaya si bucek sama kroco2nya yang sering nongkrong di gado gado tjemara itu
4740725 kita ketemuan jam 4 15 di sini terus berangkat bareng2 ke rumah soekarno di jalan pegangsaan supaya cepet kita pesen taksi aja dari sini tapi supaya murah naek yang express gue mau pulang dulu ke rumah nganterin bungkusan ini tadi adek gue nitip eskrimnya cafe piza kalo terlalu lama nanti keburu encer
4740726 dam yakin nih kita mau nyulik soekarno hatta gue jadi ragu nih nyulik itu dosa tau
4740727 iya gue juga tau tapi mau bagaimana lagi ini demi bangsa ini
4740728 kita tetep akan bawa mereka tapi jangan dipaksa kalo mereka sukarela kan namanya bukan penculikan kita bilang aja bahwa kita akan membawa mereka suatu daerah yang namanya rengasdengklok untuk meresmikan acara
4740729 begini tante kita mau menculik bung karno untuk dibawa ke rengasdengklok boleh tante boleh ya boleh tante boleh boleh
4740730 oh saya kirain ada apaan shubuh2 begini kalian sudah datang yowes daripada saya ngederin kamu ngomong kaya pegawai toko di mangga dua jadi bikin saya migrain saya panggilin mas karno dulu ngomong2 saya sama anak saya boleh ikut diculik ga nanti kalo diculiknya lumayan lama dan anak saya tambah besar terus nanti ditanya sama temennya bapak kamu kemana masa anak saya harus jawab sedang diculik kan kasian anak saya nanti jadi bahan ejekan boleh ya
4740731 tunggu sebentar ya saya bangunin mas karno dulu sama packing pakaian
4740732 oh iya tante kalo bisa tolong teleponin bung hatta juga tolong tanyain apakah dia mau ikut diculik juga kalo mau suruh siap2 sekarang setengah jam lagi kita jemput ke rumahnya tapi kalo bisa jangan bawa2 istri sama anak juga cukup tante sama anak tante aja berdua soalnya uang konsumsinya pas pasan
4740733 sudah sih tapi masih harus ada sedikit revisi lagi bisa tolong panggilkan mas adam untuk bantu revisi naskah ini
4740734 mas adam yang kumisnya tebal dan punya istri penyanyi dangdut itu
4740735 ya bukanlah masa ya bukan dong maksud saya mas adam malik

4740737 oh kalo urusan ngetik sih gampang nanti saya suruh mas say aja yang ngetik
4740738 mas say yang temennya mpok odah anak buahnya pak taka
4740739 because if i got hurt i couldnt get treatment if you dont have healthcare you dont get any respect when you go to doctors
4740740 it does not improve or build on anything mccain scares me it seems like his main focus is the war and the democrats main points are healthcare and the economy
4740741 my belief is that health care is a human right and thats how i look at the proposals
4740742 the obama and the hillary plans are very similar except for the individual mandate they both continue to build on the current system everyone agrees that the current system is in need of a massive system of overhaul they want to continue to build on a broken system because they are afraid to take on the insurance companies mccain has proposed a 5 000 tax deduction for health insurance but health insurance can be as much as much 12 000 a year for a family of four it should not be credible
4740743 one third of our healthcare dollars goes to healthcare administration because we have this very complicated multi payer system
4740744 medicare though has administrative costs of 3 4 thats a model that you can build on right now you have a lot of different insurance companies and its the middle men that dont need to be there
4740745 both barack and hillary said they would do national healthcare if it was more politically feasible you have to do whats right listen to your gut rather than listen to your campaign contributors
4740746 creating the worlds largest pizza buffet experience parallels our brands hallmark of providing an extraordinary experience unbelievable value quality food and superior guest service
4740747 this event will help us celebrate the opening of our sixth location in phoenix in just under two years we are excited to literally expand the cicis experience for our guests who know us and create the ultimate opportunity for those who have not given us a try
4740748 we are thrilled that cicis pizza chose the stadium as the site for this event and we hope that together we can host the worlds largest pizza buffet
4740749 they have invited the entire valley to attend this event and to enjoy free pizza and beverages as well as activities and entertainment for the whole family
4740750 next to godliness confronting dirt and despair in progressive era new york city
4740751 well why dont you tell him to give us something we can use to make our case
4740752 we have firsthand descriptions of biological weapons factories on wheels and rails
4740753 if someone had made those doubts clear to me i would not have permitted the reporting to be used in secretary powells speech
4740754 was not just wrong they lied they should have been shot
4740755 the third day into the most critical investigation of the entire bush administration
4740756 were starting our work and im calling everyone back weve got a huge amount of work to engage in
4740757 maybe the most frustrated person attempting to exercise the oversight responsibilities that i have on judiciary
4740758 to show respect or consideration for to hold in high esteem
4740759 but the lord said to samuel do not consider his appearance or his height for i have rejected him
4740760 submit yourselves for the lords sake to every authority instituted among men whether to the king as the supreme authority or to governors
4740761 live in harmony with one another do not be haughty but associate with the lowly never be wise in your own sight
4740762 als we ons blindstaren op het verleden lopen we het risico te worden ingehaald door de toekomst
4740763 ik denk veel aan de toekomst want het is daar dat ik de rest van mijn leven zal doorbrengen
4740764 i cant call you mr mctodd will you please tell me your name
4740765 theres not much sense in pretending now is there what is your name
4740766 but the fragments cannot demonstrate the full picture of the spectacular opening ceremony
4740767 nobody stopped us when we entered the main stadium on monday chinese officials let us in after we showed our id cards and we shot the rehearsal
4740768 the purpose of the broadcast was aimed at heightening enthusiasm toward the beijing olympics by showing south korean viewers the magnificence of the opening ceremony there was no other intention
4740769 she hardly ever leaves her flat and so to receive this letter has caused her a lot of distress she is a wonderful woman who would never cause any trouble and they could have surely checked her age before writing to accuse her
4740770 in these cases it may not be the tenant causing problems but visitors
4740771 mrs reed has contacted us and we have now gone back to the initial tenant who made the complaint to investigate further and have apologised to mrs reed
4740772 he still remembers little or nothing of what happened he had not been allowed access to his children over christmas following the break up of his marriage and his finances were in a mess
4740773 it is pure chance that it was only a wall that you collided with in the end
4740774 it seems that with a changing climate the more traditional cottage gardens may be more difficult to create
4740775 the stunning italian garden at arley arboretum is currently at its peak and is a formal garden utilising many mediterranean plants both hardy and resistant to drought and heat
4740776 more often these are also not only visually beautiful but also deeply scented
4740777 we have used these plants because as a rule of thumb anything with a scented leaf comes originally from a hot and dry climate and will flourish in this kind of garden
4740778 the italian garden was first established in the 1970s and provides a valuable insight into how these mature
4740779 in terms of mortgage repossessions obviously they are related to houses outside the boroughs control theyre individuals with private mortgages
4740780 from my perspective there is very little the borough can do in relation to the cause of that but my team at the council provide a first class service in terms of getting people to come to terms with the dreadful aftermath of a repossession
4740781 its one of the most traumatic things that can take place but they are there to help and advise in terms of rehousing and help with the points systems
4740782 i was driving past the field feeling sad and out of habit i looked up
4740783 i actually did a double take when i saw them standing there they were just so happy to see me i couldnt believe they were back it looked like someone had just walked them back into the field and left them there
4740784 we are delighted to have them home i couldnt be happier
4740785 the balls have ball bearings in so it rattles and the goalkeepers are sighted
4740786 its five a side and then you have a coach behind the goal to assist at that end
4740787 its hard im still trying to adapt and learn in sighted football you can look to see where your teammates are but we have only got our ears so we are trying to listen for the ball listen to what instructions we are being given and listen to where your opponents are and your own teammates are
4740788 its a work in progress we are trying to get more players and more teams
4740789 im excited im apprehensive and nervous because i havent been to an olympics before ive no idea what to expect we just want to go out there and hope that the training and work weve done pays off
4740790 its a devastating blow to us everyone is in disbelief they cant believe the thieves could have moved them
4740791 i cant believed they managed to travel off the premises
4740792 the west bromwich branch is the first stepping stone into the black country
4740793 we are eventually looking at opening 20 in places such as walsall wednesbury dudley and wolverhampton each big johns can typically create up to 20 jobs this move is part of our expansion plan for the midlands
4740794 the site in west bromwich was disused and we hope people driving past will be able to see the difference in it we provide great value meals which are reasonably priced
4740795 with the banks overstretching their credit facilities it could well mean that in the coming months councils will have to help pick up the pieces as people end up on housing waiting lists
4740796 even when the economic good times were rolling councils saw ever increased pressure on their social housing stock
4740797 i think as beat officers we have a responsibility to be a part of the community we serve and find a way to give something back to the community
4740798 id urge people to contact us either at cannock police station the norton canes police post behind the co op or stop us when they see us in the streets to sponsor us because it is all going to a good local worthwhile cause
4740799 we bought bikes last year and me and my wife live quite close to the chase so we regularly go cycling there
4740800 a lot of norton residents know we are on push bikes so i guess were out training the whole of the week
4740801 i cant remember when i first decided i wanted to make my own coracle but when i found out about the workshop i just thought why not
4740802 some of the men had worked as carpenters but id only ever done an ikea flatpack
4740803 i was quite confident it wouldnt sink when i first tried it on the canal it doesnt leak but it is difficult to get in and out of so i need a bit of help
4740804 i dont know if there is anyone else in sandwell who has a coracle but if there is it would be nice to start a little regatta
4740805 people do tend to do a double take it moves slower than walking pace but its very pleasant
4740806 the wet weather has not dampened spirits and everyone has been getting stuck in to the different activities
4740807 everyone has really enjoyed themselves and even the rangers have joined in
4740808 activities included doing everything from pond dipping to bug hunting and den making
4740809 sam tries to focus on lindsay but its never enough
4740810 lindsay has to be the center of attention or shell flirt with other guys to make sam jealous
4740811 shell be with the next guy who catches her eye she cant help it
4740812 no solo el mejor nadador de todos los tiempos sino el mejor deportista ol mpico de la historia y tal vez el mejor deportista de todos los tiempos
4740813 su comportamiento en el podio y durante la ceremonia de entrega de medallas no fue apropiada
4740814 su comportamiento fue contrario al esp ritu ol mpico de respeto a los otros atletas cualquier queja que tuviera esta no era la forma de expresarla
4740815 la ceremonia de premiaci n es un ritual muy simb lico reconocido como tal por todos los atletas y participantes

4740818 we directly hold the macapagal arroyo government responsible for this latest atrocity attributed to troops and militias under her control as commander in chief of the armed forces of the philippines
4740819 as commander in chief of the armed forces the president must take concrete steps to put an end to those aspects of counterinsurgency operations which have led to the targeting and execution of many individuals working with civil society organizations
4740820 the afps continued implementation of obl bodes ill for activists and poses more grave abuses of human rights

4740822 hay que esclarecer y determinar la responsabilidad de todas las personas que intervinieron
4740823 sin obviar la responsabilidad que puedan tener los servicios sanitarios hay que trabajar que para no se den estos casos ni desde el punto de vista ciudadano ni desde el punto de vista m dico y esta es la l nea en la que estamos trabajando
4740824 a la espera de evoluci n con las medidas terap uticas adoptadas
4740825 with the young players we have like anderson ronaldo rooney nani there is improvement there our players have the capacity to improve so well see
4740826 i am optimistic because i see no deterioration we have to protect the dinosaurs a little bit more giggs scholes and gary neville but they are fit guys
4740827 giggs endurance tests were the best in the club this summer unbelievable he will play a lot of games for us he is lucky because he has never carried any weight he has always looked after himself
4740828 scholes and neville are much the same theres a lot of football left in them edwin van der sar is the normal van der sar he is looking fantastic for his age and he is a great example of how to look after yourself and give yourself extra years
4740829 i am expecting a natural progression from the younger ones it is the same as what i said about rooney and ronaldo last season
4740830 a year ago i was asked if ronaldo could score more than 23 goals and i replied that i was looking for improvement
4740831 improvement can come in different ways for ronaldo this season forty two goals is a target it is still possible for him to achieve it given the talent of the boy and his goal scoring ability but you have to say its a big target for him
4740832 where you will see the improvement is in his authority and decision making which comes with experience which gives you a lot of things timing especially
4740833 there has been no problem at all his progress has been great he has never missed a session morning or afternoon

4740838 esta medida la hab an anunciado en un principio para el d a 11 y ahora para el d a 26 estamos haciendo el seguimiento y aunque sea un conflicto entre ryanair y alguna distribuidora estamos realizando el seguimiento y advertencias para que no se produzca
4740839 en ese momento se pone en marcha un procedimiento de reclamaci n contra la compa a y les apoya la administraci n las competencias las tiene la comunidad aut noma aunque tambi n pueden ir al ministerio en ese caso el ministerio trasladar a la ccaa el hecho para que sanciones si se ha producido el hecho
4740840 it was a huge change from getting a standing ovation for beating rangers in the last game of last season to being jeered off in the first match of this one against inverness
4740841 but if you are going to moan about that then you would be as well not being here we are at aberdeen to do a job and that wasnt done against caley thistle
4740842 the new boys are maybe now realising just how big a club this is if the fans see you working hard enough thats half the battle
4740843 you have to fight your corner to live up to the supporters expectations as this is a one team city and you are reminded of how much it means to them
4740844 we only took one point from 12 against them last season and they were the best side outwith the old firm
4740845 its time to change that this game cant come quick enough for us
4740846 if you want to get back into europe you need to win more than the four away games we managed last season
4740847 i am loyal to our supporters and people at the club but more than anything i am loyal to the players
4740848 we have built up a really happy relationship and strong spirit and i desperately want them to succeed
4740849 if they are going to do that i have to help them by bringing in new players who will strengthen the side and give us a better chance of closing the gap on those above us and being in europe every season
4740850 that hasnt happened this summer and i feel i have let them down
4740851 at the end of last season i wouldnt have thought it was possible we would be sitting here in august without a single new face
4740852 it hasnt been for the want of trying and i have to say the chairman bill kenwright has been fantastic
4740853 no one has worked harder to get players in but it just hasnt happened yet there are all sorts of reasons and some of it must remain private
4740854 but there arent many clubs looking to sell players at the moment and certainly some people who have been brokering deals for us have let us down quite badly
4740855 i still hope to resolve everything with the club and sign a new contract
4740856 david moyes is probably the best manager this club has ever had yet howard was the one who won the trophies
4740857 but will accept it and not allow it to disrupt our preparations far be it for me to criticise referees decisions but what referee gagelmann reported to the committee has absolutely no similarity to what actually happened
4740858 you can see clearly on the tv pictures that that is the case

4740862 the seven pieces which result from this are dark spooky affairs of ambient drone music all generated through lots of processing on the computer stapled together into some nightmare like music the dark trip doesnt fit the mood of summer day entirely but would do well at night

4740869 and the lord was with judah and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had chariots of iron
4740870 it can however be noted that there is scriptural evidence to disprove gods omnipotence

4740881 there is a certain rich irony in shell being hoist by its own environmental petard
4740882 the challenge of the 21st century is to meet the growing need for energy in ways that are not only profitable but sustainable as our 2007 results show were investing heavily in new technology and assets to safeguard the interests of our shareholders and future generations
4740883 because sustainable was an ambiguous term and because we had not seen data that showed how shell was effectively managing carbon emissions from its oil sands projects in order to limit climate change we concluded that on this point the ad was misleading

4740908 i think china will win the golds and the us will win the overall medal count and it will be a nice compromise leaving everyone feeling good about the olympics and both nations able to say they won
4740909 project 119 was not as important as people thought it would be though rowing is one sport to keep an eye on now and a place where they might sneak up on some golds
4740910 thus far they are winning in sports theyve been giving a lot of attention to for years
4740911 there is an idea out there that winning the gold medal count will erase the sick man of east asia tag that china was stuck with decades ago
4740912 they are saddled with this racist stereotype about being shorter and weaker which was imposed upon them long ago by people en the west and these games are viewed as chance to shed that forever and show the world they are a strong nation
4740913 part of what theyre trying to do through is convince themselves that this image is in the past and in that sense watching tall strong chinese men and women win medals makes them all feel tall and strong

4740930 potevano pensarci prima ora uneventuale reintroduzione dellici determinerebbe problemi per i contribuenti
4740931 la proposta di reintrodurre lici dimostra che il governo in un forte stato confusionale e ha un atteggiamento schizofrenico il leader del carroccio smaschera i trucchi del governo che per propaganda abolisce lici ma di fatto riduce i servizi essenziali per i cittadini
4740932 la proposta che porter al tavolo del federalismo fiscale non sar una semplice reintroduzione dellici ma preveder la soppressione delle oltre dieci tasse relative alla casa stato regione comune e la loro sostituzione con un tributo unico proprio a vantaggio dei comuni
4740933 e giusto ribadire che le promesse vanno mantenute questa maggioranza si era impegnata in campagna elettorale col presidente berlusconi ad eliminare lici dunque la proposta di reintrodurre questa tassa non ha ragion dessere
4740934 non possiamo dimenticare che vista la situazione economica internazionale e del debito pubblico nellimmediato la detassazione degli straordinari e labolizione dellici sulla prima casa sono gli interventi che il governo ha potuto fare nei confronti della pressione fiscale
4740935 chiediamo che allinterno del ddl sul federalismo fiscale venga data piena autonomia ai comuni con una entrata propria che lo sosteniamo da tempi non sospetti potrebbe essere legata alla fiscalit immobiliare
4740936 we played good defense right from the start it was a total team effort
4740937 right now in legazpi city you dont really have many places to go to at night you only have two malls and they close early in the evening but at the embarcadero there will be a ferry service for tourists to go to misibis which is around 20 minutes away
4740938 misibis has its own mark the area is raw and everything is master developed this means were not going to have the same challenges we have in boracay now
4740939 we are in a typhoon belt but this should not be a hindrance to the generations to come

4740958 an independent team set up to investigate the riots may 1998 found that 85 mostly ethnic chinese women were sexually assaulted but authorities dropped the inquiry citing a lack of evidence ten years later the victims remain silent because they fear for their safety and have no faith in the countrys justice system according to a new report issued by the national commission on violence against women
4740959 there is evidence that the military encourage the radical religious violence largely responsible for creating indonesias terrorism problem the indonesian military has a history of using terrorism for political purposes

4740961 for me this is a conspiracy of corrupt lawyers who feel troubled and disturbed by my stand to play by the rules and consistently fight against corruption
4740962 the accuser hotman paris hutapea is known as the most corrupt lawyer in indonesia while i am regarded as symbol of an incorruptible lawyer the judgment is outrageous and has killed my life violated my right to practice law and defied common sense and justice i will appeal but i am losing hope in the integrity of the bar association the legal profession is rotten
4740963 the new face of indonesias islamic fundamentalism pornography ban ignores the starving
4740964 while the nation was off guard distracted by soaring food prices a collapsing road system and general hopelessness the house of representatives on march 25th 2008 passed a bill banning all pornographic websites threatening to jail users and providers who will now face up to three years in prison or a substantial fine

4740967 fully covered little girls are now a common site in some jakarta neighborhoods as well as in many rural areas of java
4740968 of course the fight against corruption has stalled it is too much to expect indonesian representatives to fight against graft considering that many if not most amassed their own fortunes illegally
4740969 it is easier to attack images of lovemaking or sex than powerful people who are robbing the poorest of the poor

4741203 god does not work salvation for fictitious sinners be a sinner and sin vigorously do not for a moment imagine that this life is the abiding place of justice sin must be committed
4741204 sin cannot tear you away from him christ even though you commit adultery a hundred times a day and commit as many murders
4741205 a large number of deaf crippled and blind people are afflicted solely through the malice of the demon and one must in no wise doubt that plagues fevers and every sort of evil come from him
4741206 an earthly kingdom cannot exist without inequality of persons some must be free some serfs some rulers some subjects
4741207 as for the demented i hold it certain that all beings deprived of reason are thus afflicted only by the devil
4741208 as to the common people one has to be hard with them and see that they do their work and that under the threat of the sword and the law they comply with the observance of piety just as you chain up wild beasts
4741209 at poltersberg there is a lake similarly cursed if you throw a stone into it a dreadful storm immediately arises and the whole neighboring district quakes to its center tis the devils kept prisoner there
4741210 at sussen the devil carried off last good friday three grooms who had devoted themselves to him
4741211 how often have not the demons called nix drawn women and girls into the water and there had commerce with them with fearful consequences
4741212 i almost feel like throwing jimmy into the stove as the priest in kulenberg did
4741213 i feel much freer now that i am certain the pope is the antichrist
4741214 i maintain that some jew wrote it the book of james who probably heard about christian people but never encountered any
4741215 i myself saw and touched at dessay a child of this sort which had no human parents but had proceeded from the devil he was twelve years old and in outward form exactly resembled ordinary children
4741216 i should have no compassion on these witches i should burn them all
4741217 idiots the lame the blind the dumb are men in whom the devils have established themselves and all the physicians who heal these infirmities as though they proceeded from natural causes are ignorant blockheads
4741218 in many countries there are particular places to which devils more especially resort in prussia there is an infinite number of evil spirits
4741219 in switzerland on a high mountain not far from lucerne there is a lake they call pilates pond which the devil has fixed upon as one of the chief residences of his evil spirits
4741220 many demons are in woods in waters in wildernesses and in dark poolly places ready to hurt people
4741221 many sweat to reconcile st paul and st james but in vain faith justifies and faith does not justify contradict each other flatly if any one can harmonize them i will give him my doctors hood and let him call me a fool
4741222 no gown worse becomes a than the desire to be wise
4741223 our bodies are always exposed to satan the maladies i suffer are not natural but devils spells
4741224 reason is the greatest enemy that faith has it never comes to the aid of spiritual things but more frequently than not struggles against the divine word
4741225 reason must be deluded blinded and destroyed faith must trample underfoot all reason sense and understanding and whatever it sees must be put out of sight and know nothing but the word of god
4741226 snakes and monkeys are subjected to the demon more than other animals satan lives in them and possesses them he uses them to deceive men and to injure them
4741227 some demons are also in the thick black clouds which cause hail lightning and thunder and poison the air the pastures and grounds
4741228 the best way to get rid of the devil if you cannot kill it with the words of holy scripture is to rail at and mock him
4741229 the devil can so completely assume the human form when he wants to deceive us that we may well lie with what seems to be a woman of real flesh and blood and yet all the while tis only the devil in the shape of a woman tis the same with women who may think that a man is in bed with them yet tis only the devil and the result of this connection is oftentimes an imp of darkness half mortal half devil
4741230 the devil clutched hold of the miserable young man and flew off with him through the ceiling since which time nothing has been heard of him
4741231 the devil fears the word of god he cant bite it it breaks his teeth
4741232 the devil it is true is not exactly a doctor who has taken degrees but he is very learned very expert for all that he has not been carrying on his business during thousands of years for nothing
4741233 the devil too sometimes steals human children it is not infrequent for him to carry away infants within the first six weeks after birth and to substitute in their place imps
4741234 the fact that the biblical book hebrews is not an epistle of st paul or of any other apostle is proved by what it says in chapter two
4741235 the winds are nothing else but good or bad spirits hark how the devil is puffing and blowing
4741236 there is no rustic so rude but that if he dreams or fancies anything it must be the whisper of the holy ghost and he himself a prophet
4741237 this fool copernicus wishes to reverse the entire science of astronomy but sacred scripture tells us that joshua commanded the sun to stand still and not the earth
4741238 to be a christian you must pluck out the eye of reason
4741239 two devils rose from the water and flew off through the air crying oh oh oh and turning one over another in sportive mockery
4741240 we are at fault for not slaying them the jews
4741241 we know on the authority of moses that longer than six thousand years the world did not exist
4741242 we may well lie with what seems to be a woman of flesh and blood and yet all the time it is only a devil in the shape of a woman
4741243 we need not invite the devil to our table he is too ready to come without being asked the air all about us is filled with demons
4741244 we should throw the epistle of james out of this school the university of wittenberg
4741245 what shall we do with the jews i advise that all their prayer books and talmudic writings are to be taken from them

4741247 what shall we do with the jews i advise that their rabbis be forbidden to teach on pain of loss of life and limb
4741248 what shall we do with the jews set fire to their synagogues or schools and bury and cover with dirt whatever will not burn so that no man will ever again see a stone or cinder of them
4741249 what shall we do with the jews their homes also should be razed and destroyed
4741250 when i was a child there were many witches and they bewitched both cattle and men especially children
4741251 whoever wants to be a christian should tear the eyes out of his reason
4741252 women have but small and narrow chests and broad hips to the end that they should remain at home sit still keep house and bear and bring up children
4741253 so tenaciously should we cling to the world revealed by the gospel that were i to see all the angels of heaven coming down to me to tell me something different not only would i not be tempted to doubt a single syllable but i would shut my eyes and stop my ears for they would not deserve to be either seen or heard
4741254 you really need to separate people who attack the jesuits or popes from people who hate catholics the two sentiments are not in any way the same thing and you make yourself look silly by claiming that they are
4741255 yes but martin luther was generally a reasonable and good person
4741256 the alumbrados i e the spanish illuminati came especially from among the reformed franciscans and jesuits and st ignatius loyola the founder of the jesuit order was charged in 1527 with sympathizing with them

4741259 fiscal consolidation has paused this year and the authorities medium term plans fail to build on recent progress the fy2008 budget targets a broadly unchanged primary deficit excluding social security with a slight increase in total expenditures due to higher social security costs and lower tax buoyancy while the net public debt ratio is estimated to rise to 94 percent of gdp up from about 85 percent of gdp three years ago the authorities revised fiscal plans continue to target a primary balance by fy2011 under staffs lower growth projections the authorities plans would be insufficient to prevent net public debt from continuing to trend up

4741265 the first step for anyone struggling to pay their mortgage is to contact their lender and get advice there are a range of options your lender can consider to help reduce or reschedule your payments for a period of time while you get back on your feet
4741266 lenders will treat you fairly and use repossession only as a last resort if you take positive action to contact your lender pay what you can and show up to court and make your case you are more likely to reach an agreement your lender that allows you to stay in your home but you cannot just walk away and assume you are no longer responsible for the mortgage
4741267 we would urge anyone who is falling behind with payments on a mortgage or secured loan to speak to their lender and seek free confidential independent advice straight away
4741268 getting advice even at a late stage can help the majority of people come to a workable agreement with their mortgage lender and can make all the difference between saving or losing their home
4741269 getting advice quickly is crucial in helping struggling homeowners keep a roof over their head at shelter we often see people when its too late but the loss of their home could have been prevented if they had sought our help early on
4741270 with rising household bills and escalating food costs it is understandable that many people are struggling with their finances help is out there but it is vital people dont hide away from their problems and seek free independent advice as soon as possible

4741278 the support is there we have got fabulous support they turn up in numbers and they want to see a winning side
4741279 dont tell me any of the other 92 clubs want anything different but if we produce winning football they will produce fantastic support
4741280 its a collective thing but it starts with us playing well and winning games they have been encouraged by what they have seen in pre season and how weve played
4741281 i think theres been a good feel around the place anyway but the only way you keep that good feeling is by playing well and winning games
4741282 the support is great its really terrific away from home down at plymouth last week the support was fabulous the home support is vital
4741283 look at the support plymouth gave their team last week despite torrential rain it was very vocal very vociferous very anti the opposition thats the way the home support should be
4741284 if you at a football ground where theyre right on top of you it does make it harder for the opposition no question
4741285 in the old football grounds the atmosphere was certainly more partisan or it felt that way because when its open and expansive its not as noisy
4741286 so if by bringing the pitch closer to them helps then great but its not about that its about the team playing well and winning games
4741287 thats me i dont work at that i know im half normal and half decent thats just my personality
4741288 im not trying to do anything i havent done at every other club ive been at as a player or a manager
4741289 without the supporters the club doesnt go anywhere they will be here long after ive gone so its important you show them due respect for turning up to support us
4741290 one of the supporters who turned up to watch us train in scotland said to me you must get sick of this i bet you think were a pain in the bum dont you
4741291 i said youre kidding quite the opposite i respect and admire you for travelling the length and breadth of the country to watch us train and play in friendlies
4741292 bloody hell peoples money is hard earned so i have total respect for supporters i give out stick to people who i think are unfair but i think our supporters are great
4741293 i get nothing but good wishes from them and a good feel from them long may that continue lets hope we can endear ourselves even more to them this season
4741294 the fans are great and i dont think they understand sometimes how much they really do make a difference
4741295 the cheering and support from the stands really does help the players it just seems to give that added boost which can be so important
4741296 if a wingers taking on his man with the ball and the crowd are behind him it can just make that difference in spurring him on to get past him
4741297 most of the fans are really spot on they boost you and give you exactly what you need when you come out of the tunnel at molineux in front of a decent crowd its great to see them all and hear them cheering
4741298 its been great to hear them singing for sylvan and andy already this season they were great to me when i made a mistake against burnley last season
4741299 all the players need it because to hear praise instead of criticism really boosts a player and gives him that added edge
4741300 who knows when that extra bit of support might actually get us a goal
4741301 weve seen how great the fans can be at molineux and well need that over the course of the season
4741302 wenn man sich diese zahlen vor augen h lt wird klar dass sterreich gefahr l uft sich zu einem berwachungsstaat zu entwickeln
4741303 die initiative platterwatch hat jetzt eine logische nachfolge gefunden denn auch nach dem r cktritt platters geht der ausbau des berwachungsstaats in sterreich ungehemmt weiter
4741304 wir hatten innerhalb von vier monaten ber eine mio zugriffe auf platterwatch at verzeichnet an die 53 000 menschen haben sich die dort eingestellten youtube videos angesehen
4741305 wir konnten aber nicht nur das thema berwachung st rker im ffentlichen bewusstsein verankern sondern auch 25 000 unterschriften f r unsere petition sammeln
4741306 das protokoll dieser sitzung liegt auf unserer webplattform auf daraus geht eindeutig hervor dass der einsatz von sogenannten spitzelboxen bereits diskutiert wird
4741307 es ist zwar zur zeit noch nicht gesagt dass die spitzelboxen f r ungerechtfertigte berwachungszwecke missbraucht werden aber die chancen daf r sind gro
4741308 wir werden mit der aktionsplattform gegen diese entwicklung ank mpfen und auch weiterhin versuchen ein entsprechendes
4741309 it is time for liverpool to make their move in the premier league
4741310 rafa benitez arrived in england at the same time as i did and is beginning his fifth year at the club
4741311 it has been the same group of players and the same management structure for the past four years

4741314 i saw pictures of the board game in papers and was absolutely baffled
4741315 surely no member of the public is going to believe that a board game could be used as a weapon
4741316 could be used to conceal someones identity or could be used in the course of a criminal act
4741317 last time i check balaclavas are freely available at a price cheaper than buying a whole game you
4741318 we moeten respect opbrengen voor wat tim maeyens hier bij elkaar heeft geroeid
4741319 toen hij op het scorebord zag hoe dicht hij bij dat erepodium finishte meteen daarna gaf hij toe dat hij daarmee toch best kan leven want hij besefte wel dat hij hier vandaag zijn beste race ooit afleverde de olympische skiff finale is de ultieme droom van elke roeier en daarin vierde eindigen dus de vierde sterkste roeier van de wereld zijn dat besef blijkt inderdaad moeilijk te vatten
4741320 als je merkt dat hij pas bij tegenwind en in de laatste honderd meter die medaille uit zijn handen ziet wegglijden kan je er misschien om treuren dat gevoel moet echter snel wijken voor het respect dat we moeten opbrengen voor hetgeen tim hier bij elkaar roeide de belgische roeisport die door de media in niet olympische jaren altijd zo stiefmoederlijk wordt behandeld redt voorlopig de belgische meubelen want zeg nu zelf in welke sporttak slaagt men er momenteel in met amper twee teams een vierde en een achtste plaats weg te kapen
4741321 we agreed at the security organ that the agreement should be signed within the period of the summit

4741351 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins

4741353 there will be a big direct injection for the economy
4741354 but the indirect impact may be more meaningful for a sustainable economic lift in subsequent years it will help change the perceptions that a large number of foreign investors hold of africa and south africa
4741355 in return for these irreplaceable benefits we owe it to fifa and the rest of the soccer world to prepare properly for 2010
4741356 finally the latest newsletter of the european mathematical society has the second part of an interview with alain connes who has many interesting things to say the ridiculous recent episode of the exceptionally simple theory of everything has shown that there is no credibility in the opponents of string theory in the us earlier with the soviet union there was resistance if europe were stronger it could resist unfortunately there is a latent herd instinct of europeans particularly in theoretical physics many european universities at least in france or england instead of developing original domains as opposed to those dominant in the united states simply want to follow and call the big shots in the us to decide whom to hire
4741357 some teams pack their teams with big players and corners are a source of goals for them

4741368 it is an extremely harsh and stark environment to detain people seeking asylum while their applications for protection are determined
4741369 the very expensive security systems of the facility are quite unnecessary for the population who may be detained there
4741370 the damage that has been done to peoples mental and physical health by detaining them in remote high security detention centres such as this has been documented repeatedly
4741371 i didnt care i wasnt going to go through the thing about 2000 again so withdrawing wasnt an option
4741372 you put up with a bit of pain you dont come through these races with a bit of pain
4741373 i have to be honest there were a few touch and go moments
4741374 i was protecting it but as much as possible i was just letting it all go and not being fearful of it with about 500m to go i could feel my right leg not functioning as youd hope just sitting behind duncs meant you could match up the rhythm and once you had that sort of margin it was just hanging on
4741375 monday started to come a long and i felt fine i didn t have a hang over at all might be all the rum and coke i was drinking and no beer well i was ready for the day and i was excited because i was going to be on a panel
4741376 an appropriate way to celebrate this achievement is to commit ourselves to ensuring its success so that citizens of this region would move further towards a life free of anger free of unemployment free of disease and free of under development

4741395 its the most frustrating work ive done theres an enormous process to wade through

4741433 i feel bad for heath but at the same time i have to get my mind right and get ready to go out there and take advantage of the situation
4741434 thats the nature of football its tough for one guy but it opens up the door for a couple more before heath went down i really felt good about myself having a chance of making the 53 man roster now with heath down its just another spot thats become vacant
4741435 theyre not used to seeing someone that size run that well
4741436 thats just the first part of practice warming up they made it look worse than it was
4741437 i thought they took a lot of pride in that last drive and really came off the ball and established an opportunity for running back marcus mason to find a seam and sustain a long drive

4741450 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
4741451 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
4741452 one of the things that surprised me because i grew up in england was that people here northern ireland protestants and i only learned this fairly recently protestants would have been taught as children that they could not trust catholics i found that astonishing but when i explored it with protestant friends they all agreed that was the case
4741453 i could never understand why it mattered that i was a catholic police ombudsman it baffled me but eventually i was told this was the teaching of some churches to their people and that meant i could understand a lot of what has been said about me
4741454 ryanair planned to clamp down on screenscraping websites that he says are ripping customers off by adding
4741455 the battle against prince nuada which is to lead to co antrim in northern ireland
4741456 it appears to be more difficult for a north of irelander to allow an honest difference of opinion in an opponent so that he is apt to regard the terms opponent and enemy as synonymous
4741457 the short answer is his people are indeed from ulster from county antrim ireland they left from coleraine town circa 1719 and appear on the border of the pennsylvania and maryland colony in the early 1720s his immigrant ancestor was named alexander mckean and yes the two lads who run the ulster heritage dna project are from the same mccain family
4741458 the conservative party has no issue with the orange order it is a perfectly legal organisation and many of its members are engaged in charity and church work
4741459 co operation ireland has been very successful in a conflict situation for the last 30 years but the context has changed out there and the challenge will be to be as equally successful in the next 30 years of co operation ireland in a different context
4741460 youre in a peace building context people have this view that the peace is done and its all over and to some extent that part of the conflict is over but its by no means stable yet yes a lot of the engagement has been at the top political level but actually the grassroots hasnt been engaged in it
4741461 all of that political agreement needs stabilised and needs underpinned at the grassroots level which is what peacebuildings about in some ways the peace making is a pragmatic enterprise whereas peace building is much more vision oriented its not about single events its about process and a process that will take years and so the context becomes more difficult
4741462 international land border here which no other police force in the uk has
4741463 no one has gone public to say the army council has gone away
4741464 what i can say with absolute certainty is that in terms of pira activity that is to say terrorist activity its not happening
4741465 does it mean all the provos have gone into nine to five jobs of course it doesnt there are some involved in organised crime without a doubt but operating as individuals not operating as an organisation and i think thats the key distinguishing factor
4741466 on the other side of course it must be hugely frustrating to those who dont have that confidence
4741467 so i can understand i think the unionist community are going to look for a lot more than just a statement that pira have gone away before they are satisfied but we are not seeing activity
4741468 it pira has reduced in size but it is there
4741469 the organisation is dedicated to following a political path but it will not disband to the point where it could not carry out an operation if it needed to

4741533 i dont need no stinkin benchmark because i only use index funds so my portfolio is the benchmark
4741534 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4741535 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
4741536 each mutual fund you invest in should have its own benchmark even if it is an index fund and your portfolio should be an appropriate fixed mix of those benchmarks the benchmarks should all be capitalization weighted indexes that represent the investable universe in that asset class
4741537 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4741538 t he option should exist to invest in the benchmark as an alternative to the portfolio under consideration
4741539 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4741540 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4741541 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4741542 absolute return portfolio produced an annualized 13 1 percent exceeding the passive benchmark of the
4741543 absolute return portfolio produced an annualized 13 1 percent exceeding the passive benchmark of the
4741544 as sort of a clearing house for proper portfolios benchmarking
4741545 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4741546 that problem is pretty easily solved by calculating a portfolios time weighted return rather than irr or dollar weighted return and comparing the twr to the benchmark return twr removes the impact of cash flows on portfolio performance
4741547 you bring up a major issue with performance measurement cash flows in a portfolio are handled differently than cash flows in an index so there will always be some irr tracking error in between the portfolio and the index in an index it is assumed that the dividend is paid on the ex dividend date and reinvested in the index however in a portfolio the divided does not come in until the dividend payment date and then it might take another day or so to reinvest so by default using irr the portfolio cannot match the irr of the index
4741548 for example if you start with 10 000 and then add 1 00 000 during a year there is a twr return calculation from the 10 000 contribution to the date the 1 000 000 was added then there is second calculation starting the day of the 1 000 000 contribution
4741549 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4741550 the whole point of calculating the portfolio twr is to remove the effect of cash flows on performance thereby making a comparison to a benchmark relevent the benchmark returns do not have any cash flows associated with them and neither does the portfolios twr so its an apples to apples comparison

4741608 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4741609 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4741610 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century

4741630 it will be in the interest of the country and the nation to make him an example in accordance with the constitution and the law
4741631 if a person moves to the side we are not in the habit of bothering him this would not be a good attitude if someone is lying on the ground and we go aggressively against him
4741632 i knew i had to be within half a bodylength at the turn
4741633 i race against crocker all the time he has front half speed if i had half a bodylength i knew i would be fine when i saw crocker at the turn i knew cavic would be somewhere with him i could sort of see him out of the corner of my eye
4741634 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that cost me the race but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision it turned out to be in my favor
4741635 when people say things about that it just fires me up
4741636 it was like the 400 free relay one of the french swimmers alain bernard said something to get us going we use things like that comments like that to fuel us to get us even more excited thats what americans do we rise to the occasion when bob first told me that i said okay were going to let our swimming do the talking ill always welcome comments like that anyone who wants to say something i like it it definitely motivates me
4741637 simply other worldly when you see his arms flapping on the starting blocks it really gets your heart racing

4741641 when i was at the wharton school of business id watch him every night
4741642 when i was at the wharton school of business id watch him every night
4741643 if and when that happens then we will address it
4741644 but until then i really dont have any other comment on it
4741645 whatever moves they plan on making itll be whats best for the team
4741646 hes just a hard tenacious hitter hes a big guy and he brings it every time he makes a tackle so hes a tempo setter
4741647 i hate to lose him you hate to lose anybody
4741648 but when youve done it for as long as weve all done it it happens every year so somebody else has just got to step in and take his place
4741649 heck i cant blame him im not going to say that he cant
4741650 i still have a great passion for the game of football
4741651 i still very much love it in my heart i still feel like i can compete at a pro bowl level but the situation is going to have to be right im not going to just play for any team or any situation
4741652 maybe the owner thinks we can bridge that gap but we cant this league is in danger of becoming one of the most boring but great leagues in the world the top four next year will be the same top four as this year
4741653 we still have some way to go because rome wasnt built in a day but none of the clubs currently in the premier leagues top four were there from day one they have all had their times away from it and efforts and sometimes failed efforts to get back in so that is the challenge for us if we can get two or three more like him fabricio coloccini in then we can do this more quickly and get to where we want to be to try to get into the top four
4741654 the key is the stereo tools are available at any point in your pipeline perfectly integrated the more stereo is not another toolset to be learned but rather it is more integrated in the existing toolset than the more unencumbered the creative expression will be
4741655 we developed tools for use with maya in conjunction with autodesk
4741656 initially the way it worked is we had a requirement for stereo moviemaking tools such as a way to see 3 d while working in maya now they are incorporating that in their software there is a broader appeal as more people are producing 3 d movies
4741657 we moeten respect opbrengen voor wat tim maeyens hier bij elkaar heeft geroeid
4741658 toen hij op het scorebord zag hoe dicht hij bij dat erepodium finishte meteen daarna gaf hij toe dat hij daarmee toch best kan leven want hij besefte wel dat hij hier vandaag zijn beste race ooit afleverde de olympische skiff finale is de ultieme droom van elke roeier en daarin vierde eindigen dus de vierde sterkste roeier van de wereld zijn dat besef blijkt inderdaad moeilijk te vatten
4741659 als je merkt dat hij pas bij tegenwind en in de laatste honderd meter die medaille uit zijn handen ziet wegglijden kan je er misschien om treuren dat gevoel moet echter snel wijken voor het respect dat we moeten opbrengen voor hetgeen tim hier bij elkaar roeide de belgische roeisport die door de media in niet olympische jaren altijd zo stiefmoederlijk wordt behandeld redt voorlopig de belgische meubelen want zeg nu zelf in welke sporttak slaagt men er momenteel in met amper twee teams een vierde en een achtste plaats weg te kapen

4741692 i think its going to be terrific for the college i think were excited to host them and they will have a great experience at skidmore and saratoga its a win win situation
4741693 winning these kinds of games against also rans is what youre supposed to do if you want to be a playoff team so its a nice feeling for us to take care of business
4741694 its a good thing about being a reliever youre going to get another chance pretty quickly
4741695 anytime you play that kind of defense with a sinkerball pitcher it gives you a chance to win
4741696 pelfrey got the big outs when he needed them which is a sign that hes evolving into a quality pitcher
4741697 this is kind of a ticklish situation in that you like to develop and bring someone along in an area that hasnt been your strength but at the same time youre trying to win the game

4741699 after eight days when you get out there at first youre still kind of leery but everything went well
4741700 the shakeups got to come from the guys that are expected to perform
4741701 what we need is obviously the guys that youre counting on the guys that are making a significant amount of money and have significant performance levels to get the job done as expected and ill throw myself in that too were all in this thing together
4741702 hes a better player than this and he knows it
4741703 you could take melkys name and change it with a lot of guys on this field right now that are making a hell of a lot more money than melky cabrera and theyre better than what theyve shown too
4741704 its hard for me to fast forward because im looking at 08 right now
4741705 i dont like that too much that ticks me off
4741706 i think youve got a long list of players that want to play for him ill tell you that
4741707 hes just incredibly sharp hes a brilliant brilliant basketball mind hes going to bring a system and now you just have to find players to plug into that system
4741708 im very optimistic that we can surprise a lot of people i think that the sentiment is that we dont have a lot of talent and thats not true
4741709 i think every day hes talking whether something happens it takes two to tango i dont know if anything will come up if it doesnt it doesnt were ready to go to battle with what we have if something comes up that betters the team so be it
4741710 i understand theres going to be a level of excitement which is great
4741711 its great to have that and thats preparation for the regular season sometimes in home preseason games you look out in the stands and see tumbleweed it would be nice to have that energy level
4741712 im sure itll be a little more jazzed up because of the quarterback we have
4741713 there are many elements that go into it the huddle procedure the snap count the mechanics surrounding the play and the reads all of those things you want to see where were at and what we have to improve on
4741714 its more running the offense and making sure that while hes in there that he has a comfort level and that the group has a comfort level but theres going to be some bumps there are always bumps
4741715 you just cant go in with a hard number because the game especially in the preseason flows so differently
4741716 you dont know how long the defense is going be to out how long the offense is going to be out what the situation is going to be how long the redskins are going to keep their first team defense out so its hard to say its going to be this number hard and fast and thats what we are sticking to but usually youre trying to get 10 or 12 reps out of the first team offense that would probably be somewhere around it but i dont have it set
4741717 a lot of playing the position is you see something
4741718 hes always had a good feel for solving problems thats where he and the players have started to develop a really good feel for signals and things like that
4741719 weve just been a bad team the past two weeks
4741720 i dont know if its been because were facing better teams or what but were just not getting the job done
4741721 the way things are going for us anything can happen
4741722 i can tell shes getting more excited as the days get closer
4741723 as a competitor i can just feel the vibe like when its close to game time for me im sort of antsy and ready to go and i can hear it in her voice just watching and seeing how well the u s is doing right now and knowing my fi is over there im so excited for her i cant wait
4741724 shes been working hard she constantly tells me her training is getting better and better shes ready and she knows shes ready
4741725 last year i was trying to find myself during camp i felt so pressured as far as learning the system learning the plays the coaches wanted me to be out there the players were looking at me to see if i was supposed to be the first round pick pressure back home to see if i was going to play this year i know a lot of that is off of me
4741726 im trying to learn what the safeties are doing behind me the linebackers doing next to me the d line the stunts they run so i can know where my help is i can learn everything
4741727 i feel like if i get that down it will help me play even faster
4741728 i have great coaches i got sam madison and r w mcquarters to coach me along if i just keep taking in all the information theyre giving me i feel i can be great
4741729 we havent had a chance to discuss that the first thing were going to talk about is getting him healthy we said we always envisioned him as a big league starter
4741730 i have no idea i just have to get ready first and well take it from there i feel pretty good
4741731 there are three monks who had been sitting in deep meditation for many years amidst the himalayan snow peaks never speaking a word in utter silence one morning one of the three suddenly speaks up and says what a lovely morning this is and he falls silent again five years of silence pass when all at once the second monk speaks up and says but we could do with some rain there is silence among them for another five years when suddenly the third monk says why cant you two stop chattering

4741736 britain is an island adjacent to continental europe our security depends upon continental arrangements not encroaching on our basic freedoms that do not sap but amplify our strengths and that do not traduce the limits of public consent
4741737 they called for the establishment of a new powerful cabinet committee consisting of senior ministers defence chiefs and officials to coordinate security policy across the full spectrum of government activity
4741738 the committee should be supported by a second joint committee of both houses of parliament which would be responsible for identifying gaps in capability and to build consensus on security and defence issues
4741739 the deep guarantee of real strength is our knowledge of who we are our loss of cultural self confidence weakens our ability to develop new means to provide for our security in the face of new risks our uncertainty incubates the embryonic threats these risks represent

4741742 this is a day we want to protest the slaying of 22 innocent kashmiris

4741746 the georgians have to understand that were not afraid of united states president bush threatening us with his marines and paratroopers
4741747 the georgians say we are raping women in gori but there arent any here if they had been here wed have done it with pleasure
4741748 what are you doing on georgian territory what do you need here go away leave us in peace

4741756 i have many relatives in georgia some are wounded and others are still unaccounted for
4741757 they have already operated on him but he needs more interventions
4741758 my mother and brother left gori because my brother has a young baby but my father remained at home but our house has been completely destroyed
4741759 i have many relatives in georgia some are wounded and others are still unaccounted for
4741760 there are dead people and nobody is allowed to pick them up i am worried that there are some of my relatives or friends among them
4741761 there were times when i was not able to get through because of damage to the telephone lines
4741762 it is not clear what is happening i am very worried
4741763 we were very concerned during the days of the conflict
4741764 we were constantly receiving calls from the students families because they were very worried about them
4741765 the pitch to ankiel in the first inning just crushed me
4741766 if its in the dirt he swings at it for sure but i left it up and he hit it hard
4741767 i had good stuff i just missed with some pitches
4741768 they played a good ballgame and did things when they needed to
4741769 the pitch to ankiel in the first inning just crushed me
4741770 if its in the dirt he swings at it for sure but i left it up and he hit it hard
4741771 i had good stuff i just missed with some pitches
4741772 they played a good ballgame and did things when they needed to
4741773 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4741774 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4741775 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4741776 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4741777 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4741778 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4741779 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4741780 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4741781 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4741782 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4741783 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4741784 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4741785 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4741786 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4741787 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4741788 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4741789 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4741790 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4741791 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4741792 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4741793 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4741794 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4741795 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4741796 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4741797 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4741798 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4741799 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4741800 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4741801 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4741802 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4741803 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4741804 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4741805 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4741806 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4741807 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4741808 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4741809 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4741810 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4741811 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4741812 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4741813 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4741814 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4741815 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4741816 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4741817 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4741818 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4741819 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4741820 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4741821 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4741822 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4741823 this is a planning took where all things are going
4741824 un buen cr tico tiene que ser en buena medida
4741825 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4741826 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4741827 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4741828 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4741829 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4741830 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4741831 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4741832 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4741833 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4741834 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4741835 in seiner wg eine sichere aufbewahrung des sturmgewehrs nicht m glich
4741836 i have asked 60 to 70 semiconductor ceos and top executives if they had a magic wand and could fix or improve one problem what would it be
4741837 this is no longer the case today in some segments consumers are demanding and purchasing the absolute most leading edge technology
4741838 what will you do with 1 tflops of double precision power
4741839 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4741840 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4741841 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4741842 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4741843 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4741844 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4741845 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4741846 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4741847 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4741848 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4741849 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4741850 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4741851 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4741852 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4741853 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4741854 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4741855 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4741856 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4741857 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4741858 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4741859 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4741860 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4741861 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4741862 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4741863 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4741864 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4741865 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4741866 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4741867 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4741868 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4741869 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4741870 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4741871 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4741872 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4741873 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4741874 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4741875 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4741876 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4741877 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4741878 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4741879 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4741880 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4741881 russland muss anerkennen dass rechte im internationalen system mit verpflichtungen verbunden sind und wenn verpflichtungen nicht eingehalten werden hat das politische konsequenzen
4741882 dar ber nachdenken m ssen wie sie mit dem partnerschafts und kooperationsabkommen mit russland weiter verfahren will
4741883 when i left the opapp we were still at that particular stage
4741884 some phrases were put in some paragraphs that would clearly state that those changes that will bring about peace in mindanao will have to go through our internal processes
4741885 well you know when you say relented that is unfair its not an accurate description in a negotiation you consider each others position and come up with something mutually acceptable
4741886 from the very beginning both shared the same context of attaining peace together so theres no question that both the milf and the government were committed to find a real solution to the problems in mindanao
4741887 the milfs leaders and other moros frequently stated that unless the us government became involved and used its influence to persuade the philippine government to implement a fair settlement the peace talks would not succeed
4741888 without question the us government could and must take an active lead role in any peace process in mindanao
4741889 i was invited as were other members of the diplomatic corps by the government of the philippines usually as a diplomat if youre invited by the government and youre available you gotta go
4741890 we do not believe on the part of the us that independence for mindanao is appropriate and thats been our policy for years
4741891 we believe lasting peace in mindanao should be done within the territorial integrity of the philippines a way forward that builds strength for all of the philippines
4741892 some moro and non moro leaders and civil society activists assumed that usip was a central intelligence agency front organization whose true objective was to infiltrate the milf
4741893 i cant answer that because i havent read it ive only seen pieces of it in the papers
4741894 you know i dont have an opinion on the bje as it is called because i havent seen the moa i dont know the provisions of it and again that framework is really for filipinos and philippine institutions to determine
4741895 we support the territorial integrity of the philippines its been our position for i think 100 years we believe the territorial integrity of the philippines works as an institution
4741896 its unclear to me that there is any oil interest involved ive made very clear i think why we are interested in peace in mindanao its good for security its good for economic activity and as your largest trading partner i assure you we benefit from the philippines economically and its good for our citizens and yours too
4741897 you read about it in psychiatric evaluations but actually being able to experience it is very different

4741900 on its face is patently illegal under our present laws
4741901 nothing was proven to be unconstitutional we were compliant with the instructions of the president to follow the constitution
4741902 a work in progress preparatory to further actions within the legal framework of laws in the country and the constitution
4741903 it is the duty of the president to uphold and protect the constitution it is contrary to public policy and public order to advocate a dismemberment of the republic through the moa
4741904 there are obviously several provisions of the moa that contradict the constitution
4741905 if the moa pushes through the ancestral domain of all lumad in mindanao are now part of the bje if they want to leave they can but they have to leave behind their ancestral domain
4741906 youre talking of the entire mindanao sulu and palawan in short ancestral domain will now be the entire mindanao sulu and palawan
4741907 youre giving me the impression this is mere fear of the unknown how can you fear something that does not exist
4741908 the accountability of government officials to uphold the constitution would be rendered nugatory
4741909 i would like to request that the motion be heard in chambers in view of some very sensitive issues that led us to file this postponement
4741910 they are hiding what they tried to sneak through which is the partition of the country the question and answer by the justices in the oral arguments revealed this outrageous sellout
4741911 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
4741912 when he was attacking him he was calm like he was at the beach
4741913 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
4741914 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
4741915 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
4741916 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal about a half an hour later we heard this bloodcurdling scream
4741917 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic the way they acted was extraordinary
4741918 they reacted swiftly calmly in exiting the bus and as a result nobody else was injured
4741919 we want to make sure that the process is followed as aggressively as possible a full legal process and the perpetrator is definitely dealt with the full force of the law
4741920 the horrific nature of it is probably one of a kind in canadian history

4741925 geboren het begin van mijn album via johan kwam ik in contact met kris die voor mij 12 nummers componeerde ik schreef er teksten op en daarna werd alles ingezongen in de studio
4741926 e n van de liedjes op de cd is getiteld
4741927 en het gaat over een meisje dat kanker heeft ik kreeg het idee om zo samen te werken met de actie
4741928 mijn inspiratie voor dit lied haalde ik op het internet waar ik meer vernam over een 14 jarig meisje die haar 17de chemotherapie kreeg dat pakte mij enorm
4741929 het album is een lounge cd geworden met sentimentele teksten over het dagelijkse leven
4741930 is de titel van de debuutplaat en mijn artiestennaam is
4741931 this year we have new research that shows us the most effective form of exercise for adults especially middle age adults
4741932 and when people see results the probability goes up that theyll stick with their resolution to exercise
4741933 researchers show we can unleash exercise induced growth hormone release with 10 to 30 seconds of higher intensities of exercise
4741934 the most powerful body fat cutting muscle toning anti aging substance known in science growth hormone is produced by the body with this type of exercise
4741935 anaerobic exercise is the most beneficial form of exercise but also the most dangerous
4741936 ready set go fitness workout isnt a fad because once people try it they feel it and know this program is the real deal
4741937 the exercise induced secretion of gh plays a significant role in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism
4741938 acute exposure to gh during exercise stimulates the turnover of free fatty acids in gh deficient men
4741939 aging is often associated with a progressive decrease in the volume and especially the intensity of exercise a growing body of evidence suggests that higher intensity exercise is effective in eliciting beneficial health well being and training outcomes in a great many cases the impact of some of the deleterious effects of aging could be reduced if exercise focused on promoting exercise produced growth hormone
4741940 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

4741942 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4741943 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4741944 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4741945 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4741946 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4741947 i need to emphasize that what we have done is only in mice we dont know what the implications are for humans but it does raise a red flag that this is something that should be considered
4741948 we really dont know what ingredients in these creams are doing that
4741949 there is a need to have the various companies test their creams to see whether or not there is a problem
4741950 i am sure there are creams on the market that do not have tumorigenic activities and some of them may have anti tumorigenic activity

4741981 in my case those measurements have always been very close i didnt know at the time why the doctor decided to look into this my mom and bob didnt want me to freak out so they told me that it was simply a good idea for young athletes to have an ekg electrocardiogram test in order to look at the heart

4742014 e un sistema che figlio di una buona messa a punto dice rossi ovviamente funziona del resto un po come quando si fa a botte se le prendi sempre rimani un po suonato se riesci a darle hai un po di vantaggio io ora sono un po pi in condizione di darle
4742015 dico che normale e normale che tu ti possa permettere di volare un po alto se vai forte in pista lui sta andando forte da un anno e mezzo ed normale che si senta molto sicuro di s quello che si fa e si dice fuori dalla pista non conta niente se facesse il figo e arrivasse quarto non avrebbe senso invece cos casey fa bene io spero solo di trovare sempre dora in poi la giusta messa a punto che mi metta in condizione di combattere con lui fino allultimo giro come piace fare ad entrambi come giusto che sia e vinca il migliore
4742016 abbiamo trovato quasi subito un buon assetto soprattutto stamattina era importante per noi avere due turni di libere asciutte perch domani sembra che piova ma la gara potrebbe essere asciutta son contento abbiam dovuto provare un bel po di gomme ma poi nel finale del turno del pomeriggio ho trovato quella che mi sembrava la soluzione ottimale
4742017 no aggiunge rossi grosse no qualche miglioramento nella gestione del motore che ci consente di accelerare un po prima ma il bello dovremmo testarlo luned e marted nelle prove che faremo fermandoci qui
4742018 e da brno del 2006 che la bridgestone ha fatto il salto di qualit io credo di capirne un po di moto e lo scorso anno ho pensato che fosse il caso di cambiare gommista ora me la godo ma non posso dire di essere contento su tutta la linea sapendo che ci sono dei piloti che non riescono ad esprimersi al meglio perch hanno problemi di gomme
4742019 perch no in una giornata come oggi col monogomma sarebbe stato tutto molto pi spettacolare ma sappiamo gi che n michelin n bridgestone sono daccordo

4742105 he is a very good player i like him very much but so do all the other coaches in the world exactly what is happening with him i dont know at the moment
4742106 it is not my business it is the business for the board to talk about money
4742107 he is a fantastic player who could play in any team in the world but i am happy with my players at chelsea if one or two more players arrive it will be better for us
4742108 we play 60 or 70 games a year so the door is always open for the players here and maybe one or two more in the future
4742109 but if we lose against portsmouth it wont be because robinho is not here it will be because we havent played well
4742110 i love him as a fella and a player hes a great pro and a great person
4742111 but i had to get some money in they are the rules of the game thats why he had to go we would not be sitting here now if it wasnt for him thats a fact
4742112 he kept us up that year when he scored that goal against manchester city no doubt about that and he would have been in my team tomorrow
4742113 i have to balance the books though i had great offers for one or two other players but they didnt want to move they are quite happy to stay here and do what they do
4742114 and we know the owner alexandre gaydamak cant keep funding it its not a bottomless pit so in the end we had to accept the offer for pedro
4742115 we are short of three players that is what we need to be a squad who can compete on the domestic front and try to have a run in europe
4742116 we may have to sell another one to raise the money to buy but if another one goes thats another loan i need
4742117 there is no money left to spend on signings now but we have spent good money the owner has backed me and i cant fault what he has done in the last couple of years there are still great players here
4742118 but we still are short of cover in a few areas
4742119 all those terrific players before he even arrives and the new ones like deco hes going to be a big star in the premier league
4742120 i feel the player loses value if he is not eligible for the champions league you cannot sell a player at the same price every club will consider that i have a shortlist but the list was always short
4742121 we feel we were a fraction short last year by not much
4742122 we want to show we can get the four points which made the difference last year between us and the winner
4742123 of course we have lost some players but we have also brought some players we opted for some stability
4742124 lets focus on the short term goals and lets show later on weve learned from when we dropped off last season
4742125 usually the teams which up give you a good game and it is our target to win the first game

4742251 i would think a reasonable person would look at this and say hey somethings not right here because if people are lying this whole case falls apart
4742252 any physical evidence they had has to be just useless under these circumstances

4742260 on mxit you dont see the other person you are chatting to you tell them about your problems you get individuals or syndicates who see theres a soft target and tell her she should come work for them and can earn r10 000 a week
4742261 the girl is maybe 16 or 17 and wants to leave home the individual or syndicate say theyll organise everything and a few months later she thinks they know each other and they arrange to meet
4742262 you dont meet someone today and run away tomorrow this whole process takes time once they get hold of you physically then they can do what they want to you
4742263 then the girl can be drawn into web of prostitution and drug abuse
4742264 im leaving i dont want to live by your rules
4742265 teenagers need to realise mxit and social networking site facebook are open for anybody unfortunately curiosity killed the cat
4742266 the children who normally go missing are girls around 14 who get very hooked on mxit its an outlet and they get a false sense of security
4742267 they dont reveal their identities which is a problem because they probably talk a little more and then they get hooked in relationships and are lured into some kind of thing from there
4742268 for a lot of the children who do go missing mxit is the first port of call the trends are children going through emotional problems and its often drug related
4742269 but very seldom are these runaways not found every time they use their phone theyre creating a digital footprint
4742270 if a paedophile wants to go shopping mxit is the place to go they are in a position of power but most kids are just talking and having a wonderful time
4742271 wed like to stress the importance of parents ensuring children understand safety guidelines when registering and remain constantly vigilant
4742272 i have been inundated with calls from primary schools some very upmarket ones saying kids are groping each other and what should they do
4742273 and we live in a society where kids rule and they dont seem to get punished
4742274 so the children have a perception that there are no consequences to their actions and that they can get away with anything
4742275 at the end of the day we have to protect the other children

4742294 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4742295 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4742296 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4742297 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4742321 it does concern me that not only in missouri but apparently other states this is the person they turn to
4742322 it does illustrate how difficult it is to find doctors willing to do this
4742323 i assure them ive taken care of everything so that nothing will go wrong i help them calmly go through the procedure
4742324 it will have the same effect the guy will die
4742325 at least youre used to dealing with a lot of death in africa so that makes this easier to deal with
4742326 all the bleeding heart multicultists who do not demand an end to the severe worldwide abuse of women regardless of the fact that it is done in the name of religion and god are part of the problem
4742327 she has adopted a radical practice of her religion incompatible with essential values of the french community particularly the principle of equality of the sexes
4742328 she lives almost as a recluse isolated from french society
4742329 she has no idea about the secular state or the right to vote she lives in total submission to her male relatives she seems to find this normal and the idea of challenging it has never crossed her mind
4742330 pap io t vorr sempre bene te ne ho voluto tanto 6 impo x me t prego non abbandonarci
4742331 i would say that hes not completely out of the picture still
4742332 hes a fugitive and hes probably seeking refugee status and the thai attorney general would have to prove hes not a refugee and he doesnt deserve to have refugee status and that will be a legal process that will become a political issue in the near future
4742333 well indeed escape to england this time has turned thaksin into a political martyr which will serve to maintain the strength of his party

4742336 when that horse trading happens we dont want our mps to be sold for a pittance id rather have our guys get what they deserve or more than that
4742337 if you thought that the ipl guys got all the money wait till you see the bank accounts of the indian politicians the fellow at the lowest rung of the ladder there must have earned enough money to buy off our country
4742338 this is why we have asked them to dispatch chavvani lal the mp who commanded the maximum premium during the vote on nuke deal we have a lot to learn from him
4742339 such things are never taught no one told me how to sell myself and people of my constituency and so i am not sure if i can teach these folks the under the table tricks

4742345 i think the earthquake is not only a tragedy but an opportunity for us to grow up
4742346 ive seen so many things ive never seen in my 26 years of life
4742347 and we all barged through it is difficult to see how they close it again
4742348 irans continued attempts to conduct prohibited proliferation related activity and terrorist financing
4742349 have never been involved in any illicit activities including in non peaceful nuclear activities simply because there are no such non peaceful nuclear activities in iran
4742350 a malicious attempt to unjustifiably dissuade others from dealing with iranian banks
4742351 the attempt of the three countries to seek the restriction of the activities of the iranian banks is intended not only to exert undue pressure on the iranian government but also to disrupt the banking and financial affairs of millions of deposit holders and customers of those banks
4742352 at this rate reconstruction will last 10 years and a generation of our citizens of our children will be raised in inequality because they live in huts and have nowhere to study
4742353 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated
4742354 we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take
4742355 the snow conditions were so deep up to chest level on several of the people they just could not make any progress
4742356 i suppose youd say its mixed emotions through the group some of them extremely relieved to be down here others you know annoyed that we required rescuing
4742357 you just start telling stories i mean im a plumber so i started telling them gross stories of things ive had to do over the years so that keeps people occupied
4742358 i have come to share the joy of this country for the new era that begins with lugo
4742359 the church has shown me how the poor live in this country
4742360 that inspires me to work on behalf of this class that is so demeaned so abandoned so forgotten
4742361 today begins the story of a paraguay whose authorities and people will be implacably against the countrys thieves
4742362 fatah has showed its readiness to join a national committee to resolve the issue of political arrests by setting up a mechanism to release the prisoners
4742363 it was felt that his behavior on the medal podium and during the medal ceremony was not appropriate
4742364 his behavior was not in the olympic spirit of respect for his fellow athletes whatever grievances you may have this was not the way to go about it
4742365 the awards ceremony is a highly symbolic ritual acknowledged as such by all athletes and other participants
4742366 any disruption by any athlete in particular a medalist is in itself an insult to the other athletes and to the olympic movement it is also contrary to the spirit of fair play
4742367 this settlement isnt an admission its a recognition that life is short
4742368 not wishing to be subjected to undue control exercised over the life of the church and eager to maintain total fidelity to the successor of peter and to catholic doctrine have felt themselves constrained to opt for clandestine underground consecration
4742369 these legitimate pastors may be recognized as such by governmental authorities
4742370 however under the pressure of particular circumstances have consented to receive episcopal ordination without the pontifical mandate but have subsequently asked to be received into communion with the successor of peter and with their other brothers in the episcopate the pope considering the sincerity of their sentiments and the complexity of the situation has granted them the full and legitimate exercise of episcopal jurisdiction unfortunately in most cases priests and the faithful have not been adequately informed that their bishop has been legitimized and this has given rise to a number of grave problems of conscience what is more some legitimized bishops have failed to provide any clear signs to prove that they have been legitimized for this reason it is indispensable that legitimation once it has occurred is brought into the public domain at the earliest opportunity and that the legitimized bishops provide unequivocal and increasing signs of full communion with the successor of peter
4742371 unequivocal and increasing signs of full communion with the successor of peter
4742372 it must not be forgotten that many bishops have undergone persecution and have been impeded in the exercise of their ministry and some of them have made the church fruitful with the shedding of their blood
4742373 fragmenting post christian society increasingly divided about interpretations of its history about its national aims its values and in its political identity
4742374 the countrys lack of self confidence is in stark contrast to the implacability of its islamist terrorist enemy
4742375 the consensus of a private seminar series which met at intervals between may 2006 and january 2008 attended by former military chiefs diplomats analysts and academics
4742376 is thought to represent the views of many current senior members of the armed forces
4742377 britain is an island adjacent to continental europe our security depends upon continental arrangements not encroaching on our basic freedoms that do not sap but amplify our strengths and that do not traduce the limits of public consent
4742378 they called for the establishment of a new powerful cabinet committee consisting of senior ministers defence chiefs and officials to coordinate security policy across the full spectrum of government activity
4742379 the committee should be supported by a second joint committee of both houses of parliament which would be responsible for identifying gaps in capability and to build consensus on security and defence issues
4742380 the deep guarantee of real strength is our knowledge of who we are our loss of cultural self confidence weakens our ability to develop new means to provide for our security in the face of new risks our uncertainty incubates the embryonic threats these risks represent

4742399 we continue to see the need to care for and monitor these patients as conditions such as respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases and post traumatic stress disorder are common sometimes chronic and require long term monitoring by healthcare professionals
4742400 furthermore we are concerned about the development of new illnesses such as cancer and autoimmune disease which may have resulted from the intense exposure to dust and toxins
4742401 we offer a unique program that addresses the medical and psychosocial needs of our patients in an integrative manner
4742402 all of our healthcare providers receive special training to meet the myriad of problems that these patients are confronting
4742403 i think this study shows the importance of paying attention to the safety efficacy beliefs of individual workers
4742404 workers who feel confident in their ability to seek out and use safety information are more likely to perceive that they are working safely
4742405 the debate over the nature of the creation days is not a purely exegetical or interpretive debate it is also a hermeneutical and theological debate
4742406 the theological message of this passage is that god is sovereign over the markers that order our lives
4742407 may have employed nonsolar sources of light before creating the sun since god is light and in him is no darkness he certainly does not depend on the sun for light
4742408 our day age interpretation treats the creation days literally as six sequential long periods of time
4742409 s cientific advance on virtually all fronts which increasingly supports a theistic interventionist that is miraculous view of lifes origin and development
4742410 predicts what has been called the discovery of the century the observation of remnants from the initial creative burst einsteins equations told us early in this century that the universe had a beginning in the finite past that the cause of the universe created it independently of all matter energy and even the ten space time dimensions along which all the matter and energy are distributed
4742411 god supernaturally introduced new species sometimes with little change sometimes with significant change replacing those that became extinct
4742412 as time advances fewer and fewer species remain on the earth and the most advanced species show the fastest extinction rates this reversal is perfectly consistent however with the day age creation model according to this model for six epochs god continues creating new species and replacing certain extinct ones then with the creation of humans on the sixth day age his physical creation is complete any changes we observe reflect natural processes
4742413 there was evening and there was morning the x th day
4742414 given the parallel structure marking the creation days this distinct change in the pattern for narrating the seventh day strongly suggests that the day had or has not yet ended
4742415 we would expect the literal hebrew to say and were evening and morning day x but it does not we should understand the term day in genesis 1 as something other than its most common literal definition
4742416 satisfy our curiosity regarding sequence or chronology but by predominately theological and literary concerns
4742417 picture frames the eight creative acts of god have not been arranged sequentially
4742418 biblical scholars refer to nonsequential ordering as dischronologization or topical arrangement which actually is a common feature of biblical historical narrative it occurs whenever the order in which events are narrated does not correspond to the actual chronological sequence
4742419 a specific type of dischronologization the biblical writer first makes a brief and comprehensive statement and then follows it with more or less elaborate details
4742420 noordtzij sees in this pronounced parallelism a clue to the authorial intent moses consciously used the conceptual scheme of a six day work week followed by a sabbath rest to convey a theological point regarding the ultimate destiny of man and creation
4742421 the luminaries of day 4 are established to rule over the day and night 1 16 the fish and birds of day 5 are blessed with dominion mandate that implies rule over the spheres established on day 2
4742422 eschatological sabbath rest for the people of god the fact that the holy spirit employs the language of week is of course highly significant for it echoes the creation narratives metaphorical use of the week
4742423 genesis 2 5 6 indicates that god employed ordinary methods if vegetation could have been sustained without the sun it could have survived without the rain
4742424 the days of genesis 1 belong to the upper register
4742425 the upper register is an archetype and the lower register is an analogical replica of the upper register
4742426 of the days and the evenings and mornings is not literal but an instance of lower register terms being used metaphorically to describe the upper register
4742427 mere literary structure having no referential significance to objective reality just because the measurement of upper register time is not calibrated according to a lower register chronometer
4742428 the fundamental weakness of this objection then is that it assumes identity rather than analogy between gods rest and mans
4742429 in genesis 1 denotes an ordinary lower register solar day yet it is being used metaphorically to describe an upper register unit of time that is not defined by the earths rotation with respect to the sun
4742430 critical question is not the meaning of y m but the nature literal or metaphorical of the total image of the week of days
4742431 because it had rained a study of genesis 2 5 7 with implications for gen 2 4 25 and gen 1 1 2 3
4742432 the structure of gen 2 5 7 is the key to understanding the structure of the whole of gen 2 4 25 which turns out to be topical not chronological
4742433 immediate and broader literary contexts as well as the geographical context of the ancient near east and the theological context of canaanite religion
4742434 the phrase stah hassadeh refers to the wild vegetation that grows spontaneously after the onset of the rainy season and eseb hassadeh refers to cultivated grains
4742435 because the lord god had not sent rain on the land and there was no man to cultivate the ground
4742436 syntactically signaled the dischronology of gen 2 19 with the waw subject predicated construction
4742437 central to the theology of gen 1 1 2 3

4742440 the government wants to balance artificial and natural family planning method and how they will be carried in the advocacy in her state of the nation address the president asserted the natural family planning method but there is a mandate from her for doh and popcom on how the local government units will take charge of artificial family planning methods and contraceptives the natural family planning method is a supplementation
4742441 the purpose is to try and offset the cost of servicing tourists
4742442 the five hotels are getting together to merchandise del mar as a brand location and raise its profile
4742443 traditionally the hotel community is against increases in tot hotel taxes that dont identify funds for marketing
4742444 when you raise tot and you dont dedicate money to marketing or even a portion you can lose market share from that standpoint you are not as competitive
4742445 if you look around you see solana beach just to the north has passed a tax at 13 percent and it certainly doesnt seem to be out of line to me
4742446 it was their idea it helps them and helps the city

4742453 the movie touched by love was based on the book to elvis with love lena canadas now very rare memoir tells the powerful true story of lenas friendship and love for karen the young girl crippled and dying from the effects of cerebral palsy it is also the story of the power that elvis holds for many people in karens case the exchange of letters and gifts between elvis and her bring incredible joy and happiness to the remainder of her greatly shortened life
4742454 rockin on music if you like it if you feel it you cant help but move to it thats what happens to me i cant stand still ive tried it and i just cant do it
4742455 his kind of music is deplorable a rancid smelling aphrodisiac it fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people
4742456 i wanted to say to elvis presley and the country that this is a real decent fine boy
4742457 elvis was the king no doubt about it people like myself mick jagger and all the others only followed in his footsteps
4742458 a presley picture is the only sure thing in hollywood
4742459 a lot of people have accused elvis of stealing the black mans music when in fact almost every black solo entertainer copied his stage mannerisms from elvis
4742460 when i first heard elvis voice i just knew that i wasnt going to work for anybody and nobody was going to be my boss hearing him for the first time was like busting out of jail
4742461 elvis is the greatest cultural force in the twentieth century he introduced the beat to everything music language clothes its a whole new social revolution the 60s comes from it
4742462 there have been many accolades uttered about elvis talent and performances through the years all of which i agree with wholeheartedly i shall miss him dearly as a friend he was a warm considerate and generous man
4742463 elvis presleys death deprives our country of a part of itself he was unique irreplaceable more than twenty years ago he burst upon the scene with an impact that was unprecedented and will probably never be equaled his music and his personality fusing the styles of white country and black rhythm and blues permanently changed the face of american popular culture his following was immense and he was a symbol to people the world over of the vitality rebelliousness and good humor of this country
4742464 if life was fair elvis would be alive and all the impersonators would be dead

4742484 i sent him a note saying i always thought you were born in uniform defending republicans until i saw this
4742485 we threw around thoughts about working together on something and we werent sure if it was a book or maybe it was a film and maybe it was a show of my portraits
4742486 and here we are 21 2 years later and its all of those things its a book thats coming out next month from simon amp schuster and it is a traveling show of portraits thats in houstons museum of fine arts now going to the brooklyn museum
4742487 i dont know a single black person who likes hearing that stuff like the blacklist or black hearted
4742488 so why dont we just get together a really cool interesting group of black people and call it the black list so much about the black culture has been about reclaiming the negative anyway
4742489 thats the only way i thought i was ever going to be involved in the movies
4742490 its funny ive worked at comcast and ive done some things before but collectively this is all sort of our first experience
4742491 so everything that we said we were going to do people would say oh no that wont happen
4742492 wed say well were going to take it to sundance
4742493 you cant get into sundance you guys have never done anything
4742494 and then we got the call guess what were in sundance
4742495 then we say you know weve been talking to hbo
4742496 hbo come on do you know how hard it is to get hbo to even look at your documentary
4742497 at the end of the film it says to blacks to whites to latinos asians everybody that watches that all right this is what inspired me this is what i saw this is what i observed along the way but none of us had any excuses
4742498 we ended up where we are because we would not settle for anything other than that
4742499 we are disappointed that at first glance the agreement would appear to have a significant impact on the business model
4742500 small intimate ceremony with only a few close friends and family
4742501 its something that weve wanted to do and we want it to be legal and we are very very excited
4742502 jen was sitting at a table inside and then suddenly courteney cox walked in
4742503 they were pretty surprised and excited to run into each other jen looked incredible

4742505 every time bill macy walks into the room my heart still jumps that is true to this day
4742506 with some of this sharp price collapse in commodities you would think the market would be up a lot more
4742507 the underlying factor is that credit continues to appear to be very weak
4742508 cu l debe ser la postura nica valenciana en la necesaria negociaci n del pacto de estado por el agua
4742509 tienen ganas de llegar a un gran pacto del agua
4742510 no se puede estar al mismo tiempo con dios y con el diablo como hacen camps y garc a ant n
4742511 desde hace tiempo los socialistas valencianos y tambi n el gobierno de espa a venimos abogando por la necesidad de alcanzar un pacto del agua territorial y social
4742512 los socialistas valencianos dijimos s a la propuesta de pacto que hace m s de un a o lanzo la asociaci n valenciana de empresarios ave
4742513 pasos hacia ello en la ponencia marco del ltimo congreso federal del psoe donde gracias a las propuestas del pspv a adi se introdujo la necesidad de ese pacto y por primera vez en un documento congresual el termino transferencias h dricas
4742514 siempre que sean econ micamente viables medioambientalmente sostenibles y socialmente consensuados
4742515 frente a todos esos gestos el pp valenciano ha reaccionado siempre entorpeciendo la construcci n de desaladoras y acentuando la crispaci n social de forma directa o a trav s de la fundaci n agua y progreso
4742516 poniendo como excusa para no avanzar en las negociaciones de un trasvase el del ebro que ellos tampoco llevaban en su programa electoral y que tampoco exigieron en el debate presupuestario de 2008 retirando una enmienda suya que lo ped a
4742517 deben ser leales a sus palabras y a sus ofertas y ajustar sus hechos a las mismas
4742518 en la defensa incondicional de los intereses valencianos el consell tendr a los socialistas valencianos siempre a su lado pero eso s matiz debemos ponernos de acuerdo con qu proyectos se defienden mejor estos intereses
4742519 ni el ppcv debe utilizar el agua para dar ox geno al consell de camps ni el pspv para apuntalar al gobierno de zapatero
4742520 ha llegado el momento de demostrar que de verdad se quiere acabar con esa guerra absurda del agua que no nos est llevando a ning n sitio a nadie
4742521 al matrimonio gobernante no le gusta perder pero hay que saber perder
4742522 my reading is that crude oil prices would stabilize at 80 per barrel and it would stick there for some months
4742523 it was all very hype that oil would reach 200 per barrel now the oil price is coming down to realistic levels
4742524 rubber prices would have been under pressure if oil prices went up further because auto sales would plunge in such a scenario
4742525 thank god hes in canada because if he was some place else in the world its an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth which he deserves
4742526 in this case the accused essentially acted on his own when he decided to respond to the situation by stabbing the victim
4742527 by his own admission he had done this before and had gotten away with it
4742528 he chose to put anothers life at risk by his actions for his own personal reputation
4742529 i try not to think about him and just not look at him in all honesty
4742530 all markets all over the world in all asset classes have corrections all the time that is how markets work
4742531 no one man can bear the sin of the world its impossible its too much
4742532 lay down my life and take it back up again
4742533 do you really believe these team leaders came in here and told you the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth
4742534 i would think a reasonable person would look at this and say hey somethings not right here because if people are lying this whole case falls apart
4742535 any physical evidence they had has to be just useless under these circumstances
4742536 and frankly sir there is no doubt and no one has said otherwise that sergeant newell shot this man in the desert

4742543 i was on a kiwi experience coach that was being driven down a steep winding hill the coach driver dropped his pen and when he leant over to pick it up he fell off his seat and pulled the steering wheel
4742544 we ended up falling about 40 metres off the edge of a cliff
4742545 it was terrifying none of us had seatbelts on and i remember hitting my head on the roof it knocked me out for a couple of seconds and then i woke up in a bundle of people
4742546 its incredible that nobody died but it was so quiet after the accident that i thought everybody had but once the realisation of what had happened set in some people started screaming and it was terrible
4742547 the driver was worried the coach was going to explode so we were all clambering out of the window and up the hillside to get away
4742548 ive only had one previous experience on a mountain which was my rather intense climb up sgurr alasdair on the isle of skye last april
4742549 it was my first time scrambling rock climbing and ice climbing but i survived the week with only a mild case of trench foot and all toes still attached
4742550 kilimanjaro will be an exceptional challenge for me because although i have played basketball for nottingham university this year and consider myself to be reasonably fit the leg injuries i suffered in new zealand have prevented me from doing something as big as this until now
4742551 ive been involved in charity and voluntary work in the past mainly looking after less well abled children in england
4742552 however recently ive been meaning to focus more on those children who are incredibly less well off than us and when this opportunity arose my heart leapt
4742553 i am incredibly proud to be part of this adventure and with nearly 130 000 raised for childreach international by my group im really looking forward to making a difference to thousands of childrens lives in other parts of the world
4742554 but also dont you think he is the father of the child
4742555 but would he be sneaking into the hotel in the middle of the night to see a child whos not his i dont think so

4742559 right now the ncsl is out in the forefront of an effort to stall u s department of health and humans services medicaid rules because it will cost states 41 billion to implement
4742560 if the ncsl is out there advocating we want them to advocate the way we want which may not be how new york or pennsylvania wants it
4742561 this is not master card but rather an organized scam to get your personal information use your card fraudulently or apply for fraudulent financial devices
4742562 at no time would master card contact a card holder about charges only the bank that issued the card to you would call with potential problems with the card
4742563 we took him in here and the doll goes wherever we go

4742568 tasha flew to ohio her home town we went there and picked up ethan to bring him here now shes waiting to be shipped out a year is a long time to be without a parent i hope someone returns the doll

4742584 how the lifeguards set the flags varies depending on where the location of the breaks are which are the waves the surfers will want to play on
4742585 depending on the direction of the swells the breaks vary rather than creating conflict and putting a flag in the swim area they may narrow that swim area at their discretion
4742586 if the entire beach was a swim area it would not be reasonable the guards cant focus on the entire stretch they do observe the entire area but try to place their attention mostly on the swimming area
4742587 there always has been issues between the surfers and the swimmers
4742588 and with the recent explosion in the interest of surfing its become a problem there is a sense that more of the beach is being reserved for surfers than swimmers and some think its disproportionate
4742589 maybe on days when surfing is not optimal make a better swim area
4742590 when surfing is optimal then the swimming area would be smaller
4742591 the policy is that the lifeguards are to park on ocean boulevard if any spaces are to be had within a reasonable walking distance
4742592 if not they are allowed to park in permitted areas
4742593 she was smart as a whip she told jokes she was just a classy lady

4742817 many of us are motivated by a deep disgust with and distrust of the dnc leadership there will be no unity in the democratic party until the voices of the 18 million voters who support hillary clinton are heard and heeded until the voices of pumas are once again listened to by the leadership of the democratic party we will be guided by that defiance we will treat insult with uprightness and will meet disdain with disdain we will not be bullied brainwashed or bossed into falling in line we are motivated to action by our shared belief that the current leadership of the democratic national committee has abrogated its responsibility to represent the interests of all democrats in all 50 states they are misleading our party and aim to mislead our country into nominating an illegitimate candidate for president in 2008 our goals are fourfold 1 to support the candidacy of hillary clinton updated 6 7 08 hillary clinton was forced to suspend her campaign because the dnc decided to select its preferred nominee so we are not directly campaigning for her we consider her to be the leader of the democratic party and our members will continue to support her throughout this election cycle 2 to lobby and organize for changes in leadership in the dnc 3 to critique and oppose the misogyny discrimination and disinformation in the mainstream media including mainstream blogs and other outlets of new media 4 to support the efforts of those political figures who have allied themselves with hillary clinton and who have demonstrated commitment to our first three goals if you have found yourself during this primary campaign disheartened discouraged or disgusted by the actions and inactions the divisiveness and discriminations of the democratic party the press the mainstream blogs and many political leaders you will feel at home here

4742846 it can blind individuals to reason it can cause them to cry out for revenge it can tear communities apart
4742847 how can it be managed some would say that justice is the answer and indeed we should always seek for justice
4742848 however we know that in a flawed and broken world complete justice is hardly ever experienced we do not live in a world where we can experience absolute justice
4742849 with justice as with so many other things in life we frequently have to settle for something less than the absolute

4742861 these girls spent far more time with the coaches and team leaders than with their own parents who else was there to make sure everything was o k
4742862 isnt the fact that lenders were willing to lend in the first place the reason were in this mess
4742863 consumers across the country will have access to safe affordable financing with downpayments of only 5 percent on most mortgages
4742864 with 100 percent financing available on some loan products and we could see an upturn in home sales this summer
4742865 all i could think was thank god there was nothing in my ear
4742866 subprime only leached into the securities markets after it was already a horrible problem there was complete breakdown in lending standards a complete breakdown one can infer from that fact in supervisory standards for lending or at least the application of those standards
4742867 weve also found other regulatory gaps not just statutory regulatory gaps for investment banks but also for mortgage brokers and we have discovered a host of perverse incentives in the securitisation process only a small portion of which are the responsibility of securities regulators
4742868 hay gente que no tiene visi n para detectar d nde est el talento
4742869 espero que reina sea justa conmigo ahora que va a reemplazar a moria por unos d as el a o pasado no lo fue hice una prueba para entrar a la revista de cherutti antes de que me contrate gerardo pero no qued porque justamente la directora art stica de ese espect culo dijo que no pod a caminar ni bailar sobre el escenario
4742870 yo no me perd y todo lo hice tal como estaba previsto
4742871 please look at the photographs of these recently sold houses and tell my again why your home should sell for 25 000 more
4742872 dont push me ill pull you instead and if you push too hard ill pull away
4742873 basically i have the most experience besides dandre who played a lot more than me last year
4742874 but as far as knowing the offense knowing all the positions knowing what guys have to do knowing what the coaches expect thats my role i have to make a lot of plays all the time lead by example and show those guys how it needs to be done
4742875 but now when i look back i see there was a big distance between me and the guys who were playing a lot practices were the games to me those guys played on saturdays i played monday through thursday those were my games thats how i treated it i tried to have just a ton of fun make a lot of plays and i feel like this year the coaches are going to give me an opportunity to go out there and make some plays against some guys who dont wear the same colors as us
4742876 that was the best moment for me in the match
4742877 it was there from the first lap the first turn
4742878 its about an 8 5 out of 10 said michael maggard of lake oswego ore last week after reaching the summit with his son sequoia
4742879 lookouts firewatchers of the cascades and olympics by the late ira spring and byron fish pack trains carried supplies from glenwood to the 4 200 foot elevation point where a camp was established
4742880 there are a lot of routes for tight ends in this offense
4742881 a lot of our offense is built around those guys in the check down type routes
4742882 we want to rotate all three of the tight ends on a regular basis
4742883 he gave up two runs in the first then kind of settled down and threw well the next two innings and we tied the game
4742884 i thought hed found himself in the second and third innings he threw some good sinkers some good pitches
4742885 i think that opening walk in the fourth just set him back
4742886 i believe richie still has good baseball in him but i believe richies an everyday player and i think it was tough what we were asking him to do
4742887 these are baseball decisions the shakeups got to come from the guys that are expected to perform melky cabrera batting ninth in our lineup is not supposed to be a difference maker in this club either way he was supposed to be able to slide right in while everybody else did their job
4742888 what we need is obviously the guys were counting on the guys that are making a significant amount of money that have significant performance levels to get the job done as expected and ill throw myself involved in that too i want to make sure im not pointing fingers were all in this thing together
4742889 id like to have one more chance without a doubt
4742890 it really would have to be the right place and the team that did it would have to believe i wouldnt walk away
4742891 i couldnt have been asked to shoot against a better shooter
4742892 i hoped he wouldnt miss because tore and me are really good friends but i could feel the nervousness building inside me so i was hoping it wouldnt last much longer
4742893 it had to be my day otherwise how can one think of defeating like likes of ralf christian and others
4742894 why not it is a good feeling to get medals
4742895 i will go to london and focus at the age of 50

4742897 i feel a little bit of everything relief excitement everything
4742898 we agreed at the security organ that the agreement should be signed within the period of the summit
4742899 all the parties appear to be agreeable to reaching an agreement this weekend but its a wait and see situation
4742900 with the signing of this accord all russian troops and any paramilitary and irregular troops that entered with them must leave immediately
4742901 yes ideally we would like a vote formalizing the ceasefire this weekend
4742902 but well take as long as it takes we are not going to push for a vote if we know that the russians will veto the text which does not mean we have to give in to all their demands there has to be hard bargaining
4742903 es ist etwas sch nes dabei zu sein ich versuche gas zu geben und zu zeigen was ich drauf habe

4742913 we are very pleased to announce the signing of tim melville tim his family and advisor jason cook remained committed to this process from start to finish
4742914 tim is a very talented young man and we are excited that we were able to add a player of his caliber to the royals organization
4742915 developing an alternative method of administering vaccine therapy that is well tolerated by most patients and produces similar immune responses to standard methods may help further the development of vaccine therapies for prostate cancer
4742916 i wanted to prove myself abroad and the premier league is where most of the stars if the national teams play
4742917 now i am here i just want to score goals for wigan i have come here with a big reputation but i wont say how many goals i will score that is not my way
4742918 it may take me some time to become the no 1 striker in the premier league but that is what i want to be
4742919 it wasnt an easy deal to do but i think it is going to be worth it
4742920 zamalek wanted 6 5 million for him but we werent going to pay that for a striker who has yet to prove himself abroad even if he is treated like the king of egypt at home
4742921 that would be the best for me and it would allow some of the other boys in team calzaghe to get a good showing in front of the welsh fans
4742922 everyone who knows me thinks of me as a nice guy outside the ring but at this point in time i cant wait to get in the ring and do some damage
4742923 banks is facing someone that is very very fired up right now my nasty head is ridiculous at the moment just watch me in the gym and you will see everything im hitting is full of nasty intent
4742924 the fight was going to be alexander alekseev because banks wouldnt have been ready in time after his last fight
4742925 but now it has been put back he banks has accepted the fight
4742926 my wish is to do well is to do well enough here so rangers take up the option to buy me
4742927 there were other clubs interested in greece and spain but the only club i was interested in signing for was rangers
4742928 its a really big club and when i found out the manager had been watching me for a while i took notice of that
4742929 aaron is one of my boys he played for me at under 17 and under 19 level and he is a very very good player
4742930 his main focus is to play in an attacking and creative way and he has great skills
4742931 aarons ability is fantastic and as well as creating goals for other members of his team he can also be a strong scorer himself for rangers
4742932 he has matured in a good way and that has pleased me as he was playing for valencia in the champions league at a very young age that was an incredible and terrific achievement for aaron
4742933 marc has excellent ability and talent he likes to try and control the midfield area and he can make creative passes as well as keep possession
4742934 it was not easy for him at barcelona with players such as xavi and iniesta ahead of him and he could not get a regular opportunity but that does not mean he cannot be of big value
4742935 lead test kits are a reasonable first step for homes built before 1978 if no one in the house has elevated blood levels
4742936 every homeowner should test their home for radon and we recommend that people use long term test kits because radon levels can change from day to day and month to month
4742937 weve been linked with pandiani but i can honestly say to you his name has never been mentioned in the eight months ive been at the club
4742938 in fact to be perfectly honest ive forgotten he existed ive no idea where he plays and its rather strange to say to me weve been linked with this player and that player when i have no idea where that comes from
4742939 todays settlement is a major step towards making these investors whole
4742940 i have received hundreds of calls from missourians and investors around the nation who need their money to make medical payments run their businesses or retire as planned i am pleased that six months of uncertainty and worry is over and that these investors will soon get their money back
4742941 investors should not have to wait any longer for access to their money
4742942 with some care we can continue down a road that keeps our lakes and streams healthy and productive but every misstep takes us farther down the road toward worse fishing reduced biological diversity and higher utility bills thousands of missourians will be out fishing and boating during the long labor day weekend so it is especially important that they are aware of the danger of aquatic invasive species right now

4742951 the republican party left me the republican party is no longer the one i joined and worked with for three decades

4742954 the libertarians have actually become much more of a factor
4742955 they win some local elections and the greens win some local elections in small towns but even in a state like georgia where hes most likely to do well i doubt he gets even 5 percent of the vote
4742956 theyre the greatest years america had they were the last years we balanced the budget until nixon if america knew that all of our problems were coming from alcohol they would go dry overnight again
4742957 hes running because this issue is so important to him
4742958 its an attempt to get an issue you care about and give it some life
4742959 ken has been instrumental in completing the restructuring of the companys financing arrangements and we are confident in his ability to lead nexcen as the company continues to execute the business restructuring plan initiated in may which focuses on the franchising business
4742960 we are very pleased to have completed the restructuring of this bank credit facility with btmucc and are gratified by the ongoing support of our lender
4742961 maybe we can teach people to do the right thing and be noisy about it
4742962 youre doing a disservice to the business if you dont complain
4742963 i think of all sorts of things and see everything
4742964 do more with less but its harder to do in the service industry
4742965 today good is the new great and bad is acceptable
4742966 if there wasnt a breakdown in service theyll rate it high
4742967 are more truculent now they are more hostile customer service is a glaring byproduct of that change in society
4742968 companies will spend thousands of dollars on motivational speakers but dont do little things like listening to people or simply responding to complaints

4742979 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4743060 we are committed to doing our bit to keep the adventure in adventure and counter the epidemic of the cotton wool culture which concedes to the notion that all risk must be bad we believe that zero risk equals zero development and that responsible risk taking generates important societal benefits such as building self confidence and encouraging an i can rather than an i cant attitude

4743072 as a large newly private concern chrysler has and in our view will continue to present a challenge to the remainder of the industry as the industry adapts to the reality and potential for sharp changes in the competitive landscape driven by chryslers actions
4743073 chrysler has embraced its status as a private entity as an enabler for a series of decisions that at best are unsettling to the rest of the industry at worst they could prove to be highly disruptive
4743074 cerberus may be a long term investor but we see it exiting its chrysler stake within five years of its initial acquisition
4743075 in our view the original merger strategy remains sound and it is the execution that has lagged

4743120 understandably the appealing idea that australian football is a truly australian native game recognising the indigenous people rather than deriving solely from a colonial dependence upon the british background has been uncritically embraced and accepted in some places
4743121 but i think this is an oversight this book should have included an alternative view i dont think the term seductive myth is right thats upsetting we have evidence our evidence my elders have told me stories of games they know
4743122 they told her to take her washing in as they were claiming the back garden she was understandably very upset and was in tears
4743123 we couldnt believe they could take it away weve been looking after the garden for nearly 20 years now the builder has put a fence up through our garden
4743124 as far as we knew the garden had always been part of the house it was only when we thought of building an extension that we looked at the title deeds and found it actually belonged to the property next door
4743125 when it came up for sale we offered to buy it but were refused we thought it was the right thing to do but i wish we hadnt said anything now
4743126 ashfords property deeds clearly show the boundary limits and there has never been any evidence or suggestion from any party that these are not correct
4743127 since taking ownership of the land ashford has extended considerable goodwill to mr muir whose guesthouse clients have used the access from lady road as an overspill car park

4743140 real time information systems are among the most immediately and obviously useful innovations in transport information provision
4743141 by providing constant updates on arrival times for bus services they put the travelling public back in control of their journeys
4743142 the passengers know how long the wait will be whether they have time to go and buy the newspaper or make that telephone call whether they are running late or in time for appointments like most good ideas its simple but extremely useful
4743143 it may prove to be particularly useful in rural areas where bus services are less frequent and miscalculating a bus arrival time could lead to a long inconvenient wait
4743144 sestran aims to ensure that the same quality of real time travel information is available to travellers across the partnership area
4743145 the bustracker system in edinburgh city has been highly successful and is hugely popular with the travelling public
4743146 real time information helps to encourage more people to travel by public transport so we warmly welcome the fact that east and midlothian councils are introducing more signs in their areas this is excellent news for bus passengers
4743147 stephen worked very hard on the course and i had no doubts that he wouldve been successful in a career as a photographer he had his own way of looking at the world and that wouldve served him well
4743148 stephen wanted to be a photo journalist and he had the talent for it he was already doing well at getting work experience on different papers
4743149 he made a lot of sacrifices to be on the course and never had much money
4743150 it was things like that which made him stand out as a real character
4743151 i knew stephen for three years and i cant believe this has happened i was just in paris with him in june on a college trip and we were part of a group of friends who hung around together a lot
4743152 stephen was right into his music and clubbing but he was passionate about photography and very ambitious hed always be telling you about what he was going to do in the future
4743153 he was really the life and soul of the party who could talk your ears off he was bright and bubbly full of ideas and enthusiasm
4743154 he was such a nice guy and always willing to help you out on a photography shoot he helped me a number of times
4743155 he was doing well with the press stuff but he also liked to take quite quirky abstract shots as well
4743156 we were quite nervous beforehand we got a loan of a giant tv screen had the room blacked out and had it all set up like a sports bar but we were very good we didnt pop any corks until after the final
4743157 the good thing about it is being a sprint its all over quite quickly but it seems a lot longer at the time
4743158 we just went wild when they won it was just fantastic we could see his mum dad sister and sarra his girlfriend jumping up in beijing with their flags just like we were so it was just like being there its superb
4743159 to beat them by half a second made it that exciting honestly it took every inch of effort in beating the french who have been invincible
4743160 theres still plenty in the tank if i get three golds ill do a dance for you and thats a promise
4743161 theyre up on cloud nine it was such a fantastic result for him on the first day
4743162 weve got another four days of this i dont think i can stand it
4743163 he was always very quick and very determined even when he was just a wee boy on his bmx he was terrifically competitive right from the start
4743164 chris hoys magnificent achievement in beijing has made edinburgh proud congratulations to him and his team on their olympic triumph
4743165 my own view is that now is not the time to renew or refurbish city chambers furniture
4743166 in the last few months school budgets have been cut nursery school hot meals have been abandoned numerous voluntary organisations have seen funding reduced and community centres are losing full time workers
4743167 when front line services in edinburgh are being cut across the board this seems at the very least to be ill judged timing
4743168 this historic furniture is a civic asset different people put a different price on preserving our heritage but this administration considers that we should take advantage of this opportunity not only to preserve it but to see it in practical use within the city chambers
4743169 to do otherwise would mean selling the chairs or allowing them to decay and neither would be the right decision for the city
4743170 the desks and chairs belong to the city not the council
4743171 in isolation the tram link is likely to have limited impact on the attractiveness of west edinburgh as a location choice
4743172 at best it may increase the attractiveness of edinburgh compared to other third tier cities for investors but is unlikely to propel it into first tier location status
4743173 outside of the city centre an efficient transport system is vital in making a successful business location
4743174 for most professional services companies 85 per cent of costs will be staff related
4743175 providing a range of transport choices for workers will improve staff wellbeing lower churn rates reduce costs and ultimately increase profitability
4743176 coupled with the quality of buildings and the strategic position people based businesses could enjoy a competitive advantage in west edinburgh
4743177 you very rarely get a definite answer for why firms choose manchester dublin or elsewhere instead of edinburgh it is a combination of factors but one of the main ones will be transport
4743178 the trams will significantly improve the perception of the city and improve links to the waterfront area and leith but they will not make a significant difference to our job in the city of attracting new firms
4743179 many major financial companies already have global headquarters in edinburgh and the number is growing and many have spoken in support of the trams scheme
4743180 it will serve existing businesses along the route and provide a much needed link between the airport the west of the city and the rest of the capital
4743181 we got it wrong not only did it rip the soul from our trams but it ended up costing us money
4743182 it will be an act of environmental suicide an act of economic suicide if australia were to be so far in front of the world implementing an ill considered not yet properly developed and tested emissions trading scheme if we havent got a genuinely global response
4743183 experience based and description based perceptions of long term risk why global warming does not scare us yet
4743184 when it was first raised i saw it as a soft but effective way of internationalising our game and growing it domestically
4743185 heres a new side for you guys playing a sport you dont already watch but we want you to hopefully filling that stadium just around the corner week after week and just to make it even more baffling well name it after a country representing hardly any of you and still try to convince you its your team
4743186 proposal would bring an expanded television audience in ireland and across britain the celtic brand could also open a marketing bonanza given the international cache afforded the boston celtics a basketball team and the glasgow celtic a soccer team
4743187 there is no credit that we have secured the soccer rights and sufficated sic the sport much to the chagrin of its supporters
4743188 at the time soccer australia chairman david hill trumpeted the channel seven c7 deal as an absolute lifeline for mass entertainment soccer if the email is interpreted literally it appears their intention was to bury soccer
4743189 taken on its face its an incredibly alarming retrospective on how disadvantaged soccer was in a highly competitive market twenty two months ago we had no content the nsl was in the last days of its history but not televised and the socceroos had not played at home for 31 months
4743190 when you compare this with the visibility of the other three football codes remembering the popularity of sport is inevitably measured by hours on tv we werent even on the radar screen
4743191 kewell changed his mobile number immediately after the asian cup with express instructions that it was never to be given to arnold that just about tells you everything for arnold and his media mates to try and spin it otherwise typifies the self delusion
4743192 guess what there is even more work to be done

4743195 your new roommate for the 2000 2001 school year is britney spears please keep this information to yourself as ms spears is under tight security and would like to remain quiet about the matter of her college attendance
4743196 i sure hope it doesnt change the newborn batman movie
4743197 its been a tough assemblage but this programme has place me on a actual high i was crying when i was told
4743198 we cannot comprehend our foremost scientists and trainers laboured for five eld with the strongest fiercest dobermans rottweilers and slavonic wolves they created a killing machine
4743199 well we got our foremost aesthetical surgeons labouring for five eld to make a crocodile look like a basset hound
4743200 when i received these messages i sent one back saying that i was no longer a victim and i wouldnt be frightened into keeping quiet
4743201 i wanted to speak out first to get justice but also so other victims dont feel so alone im not going to change that and be intimidated because anyone feels ashamed by what some members of my family did
4743202 these people are attacking dana because she spoke out about the paedophile ring they are trying to intimidate her into silence but that wont work
4743203 dana has just recovered from an illness which couldve killed her so she doesnt need the stress but shes not going to be afraid of these death threats
4743204 we applied for the extension until 11pm but we are delighted with the 10pm licence our customers will appreciate the extra hour
4743205 i know there will be some opposition but i think it will work we have got a new night time team in to monitor this i think we have got to try it and see how well it works
4743206 the police did raise concerns but it was a comment not an objection they were very clear on that
4743207 i believe that 9pm is an appropriate time for the permission to cease as this will permit the clearance of the public footways of table and chairs to permit free passage of those patrons attending the late night entertainment venues around the city
4743208 we were trying to help people out to give smokers somewhere to go with the smoking ban and trying to promote edinburghs cafe culture
4743209 as far as im aware the council seems happy to grant a licence until 10pm but not as late as 11pm im in agreement with that
4743210 we are very concerned that the important information and recommendations in the report should not be buried
4743211 we very much hope that the report will be officially published by lothian health as soon as possible and will be widely distributed to health and social care professionals as promised
4743212 we are entirely relaxed about edmesh placing the draft report on its website indeed we will be putting it on our own website and we are already in the process of arranging this to take place within the next few days unfortunately any delays have been due primarily to changes in personnel
4743213 we are planning to undertake a comprehensive review of me services in lothian and we welcome this report which we believe will be informative and will form part of that review
4743214 you mean like they feature in dweller personnel dramas when they collar someone

4743216 sir i have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up but while i am coming another steps down before me
4743217 it is the sabbath it is not lawful for you to carry your bed
4743218 he who made me well said to me take up your bed and walk
4743219 hell either go to france and then the dewhurst stakes or france and then the racing post trophy
4743220 the ground has changed overnight to heavy as theyve had a good bit of rain
4743221 weve been linked with pandiani but i can honestly say to you his name has never been mentioned in the eight months ive been at the club
4743222 in fact to be perfectly honest ive forgotten he existed ive no idea where he plays and its rather strange to say to me weve been linked with this player and that player when i have no idea where that comes from
4743223 that would be the best for me and it would allow some of the other boys in team calzaghe to get a good showing in front of the welsh fans
4743224 everyone who knows me thinks of me as a nice guy outside the ring but at this point in time i cant wait to get in the ring and do some damage
4743225 banks is facing someone that is very very fired up right now my nasty head is ridiculous at the moment just watch me in the gym and you will see everything im hitting is full of nasty intent
4743226 the fight was going to be alexander alekseev because banks wouldnt have been ready in time after his last fight
4743227 but now it has been put back he banks has accepted the fight
4743228 i wanted to prove myself abroad and the premier league is where most of the stars if the national teams play
4743229 now i am here i just want to score goals for wigan i have come here with a big reputation but i wont say how many goals i will score that is not my way
4743230 it may take me some time to become the no 1 striker in the premier league but that is what i want to be
4743231 it wasnt an easy deal to do but i think it is going to be worth it
4743232 zamalek wanted 6 5 million for him but we werent going to pay that for a striker who has yet to prove himself abroad even if he is treated like the king of egypt at home

4743234 le monde a vu avec inqui tude la russie envahir un etat voisin souverain et menacer un gouvernement d mocratique lu par son peuple cet acte est absolument inacceptable pour les nations libres de la plan te
4743235 si la russie veut commencer r parer les d g ts quelle a caus s ses relations avec les etats unis leurope et les autres nations si elle veut restaurer son rang sur la sc ne mondiale elle doit mettre fin cette crise
4743236 il me semble quil faudrait une sacr e bonne raison pour rompre les liens avec la russie et revenir aux heures sombres de la guerre froide je ne pense pas que les v nements en g orgie nous fournissent encore cette raison
4743237 je nai jamais pens que nous tions tr s efficaces quand nous manions le b ton et la carotte avec une nation aussi grande que la russie nous navons jamais gagn grand chose ne pas parler aux gens qui sont diff rents de nous
4743238 nous ne pouvons pas perdre de vue ce qui est en train de se passer savoir que pour la premi re fois depuis que lunion sovi tique sest effondr e des soldats russes ont envahi et occupent un pays tiers mais isoler la russie ne fait pas vraiment partie des options possibles la russie ne peut pas tre isol e elle est trop grande trop puissante
4743239 whip out your tasting spoon and have some kitchen fun
4743240 my wish is to do well is to do well enough here so rangers take up the option to buy me
4743241 there were other clubs interested in greece and spain but the only club i was interested in signing for was rangers
4743242 its a really big club and when i found out the manager had been watching me for a while i took notice of that
4743243 aaron is one of my boys he played for me at under 17 and under 19 level and he is a very very good player
4743244 his main focus is to play in an attacking and creative way and he has great skills
4743245 aarons ability is fantastic and as well as creating goals for other members of his team he can also be a strong scorer himself for rangers
4743246 he has matured in a good way and that has pleased me as he was playing for valencia in the champions league at a very young age that was an incredible and terrific achievement for aaron
4743247 marc has excellent ability and talent he likes to try and control the midfield area and he can make creative passes as well as keep possession
4743248 it was not easy for him at barcelona with players such as xavi and iniesta ahead of him and he could not get a regular opportunity but that does not mean he cannot be of big value
4743249 it is impossible to speak in such a way that you cannot be misunderstood
4743250 they seem to be adjusting well to their new environment

4743276 our study reveals potentially clinically relevant differences in the gene expression of different cancer types and represents a reference framework for interpretation of smaller scale functional studies
4743277 this segregation of tumors into three groups with distinct expression patterns is surprising clearly the developmental trajectory provides a meaningful background for capturing large scale differences in gene expression across diverse conditions
4743278 shifting our focus from single sets of genes or processes to the biology of aggregates on the order of the entire transcriptome is likely to be useful in establishing highly robust molecular correlations between seemingly unrelated disease phenotypes

4743281 it is ironic because for a large number of patients with ards it is the treatment rather the syndrome which ends up killing them
4743282 now we apply tidal volumes normalized per ideal body weight of six to eight ml kg down from 12 to 15
4743283 the consequences are of course potentially more dangerous in patients in which the chest wall elastance is more compromised and the lung volume is more reduced
4743284 the immediate clinical implications are that clinicians should not trust the conventional measurements
4743285 if we could decrease with more refined measurements the mortality rate due to mechanical ventilation by 4 5 percent this could save up to 7500 lives in the u s if we accept that ali ards has an incidence of 150000 year

4743291 being a specialist gives us tremendous focus and an edge over big four accounting firms
4743292 the difference is that when you are doing the pre valuation work the approach is to look at the company as a whole at that point in time the focus is more on arriving at a right price for the company also to be taken into account is the fact that there would be three other bidders for the same acquisition so the price arrived at should be able to outdo the counter bids
4743293 currently the discount rate for valuations of indian companies is much greater than ifrs compliant companies there is a very clear distinction if you are forced to raise capital you are forced to raise at higher rates if you are doing those fccbs you have to restate your accounts according to the global norms
4743294 when companies like us get involved in the deal process from the beginning we are able to tell them that certain assets are going to fall under the category that will get impaired very quickly so we are in a position to tell the promoters that from the market perspective it may not be such a good deal or it would possibly make more sense if they paid slightly less for the acquisition

4743306 older people are among the prime contributors to climate change but also potentially some of the first casualties there is an urgent need to exploit synergies between climate change policies and policies aimed at older people and to avoid duplication and contradiction older people must be part of the solution we need to make it easier for them to conserve energy use public transport and maintain crucial social networks that will help them better cope with the effects of a changing climate
4743307 two enormous but utterly predictable waves will be rolling across the global landscape in the coming decades the ageing of our populations and the effects of climate change whatever other political and social policy changes will command our attention these two challenges will be constant and unrelenting older people are likely to be physically financially and emotionally less resilient to climate change and government strategies will need to address this

4743338 as an olympian myself i know firsthand that an athletes vision and visual skills are critical tools both on and off the field
4743339 vision is a critical component of overall physical health that makes a large contribution to overall performance after having worked with a number of elite athletes i am surprised how many are not seeing as well as they could at this level of competition an athlete should not be squinting to focus on a ball a hurdle or a teammate on the field if you are not seeing well your reaction time is slower and that may impact your overall performance
4743340 most people are familiar with 20 20 vision and do not realize that the limit of human vision is 20 08 many elite athletes see better than 20 20 which is not surprising since the superior demands of competition require their visual systems to perform at the highest level
4743341 were honored to be entrusted with the vision care for the olympic athletes and team staff while they are in beijing
4743342 through the olympic village polyclinic johnson amp johnson vision care will provide the athletes access to best in class vision care services and products to help them maintain visual health during competition for some athletes who have limited access to vision care services this may be their first opportunity to receive eye care and diagnostic services which can have a significant impact on their everyday lives
4743343 yeast express a protein called hsp104 which is able to reverse protein aggregation
4743344 however for reasons that are unclear hsp104 is not found in mammals we wondered if introducing hsp104 into mammals could help with diseases connected with protein aggregation
4743345 one thing wed like to do next is to treat an animal model which already has considerable quantities of alpha synuclein aggregates to see if hsp104 can actually reverse the process in the rat brain
4743346 factoring in only the public sector costs for maternity care delivery and one year of infant related care for those contraceptive clients who would be eligible for medicaid maternity care in their state if they became pregnant

4743349 disparities in screening between racial and ethnic groups even in a homogeneous state such as nebraska are a problem and by digging into some of the differences we were able to have an impact on breast and cervical cancer screening
4743350 a snapshot of the women served through the program and the services they received
4743351 we have used the data to direct program resources and manpower
4743352 programs such as ewm together with other outreach efforts in the state might have helped to improve or increase preventive services such as screening for breast and cervical cancer to the point where nebraska ranked 26th in screening for these conditions in 1990 and now ranks 16th nationwide
4743353 we look for eligible populations then see who is not being screened and target them

4743477 the pentagon had been studying possible targets in the same spring i e 1998 that the cia had been drawing up its secret plan to raid tarnack farm
4743478 leads to one person as well as one global terrorist organization
4743479 we have very good evidence of links between osama bin laden al qaeda operatives and what happened on september 11
4743480 proof had to be delivered that the september 11 terror attack came from abroad
4743481 i have seen absolutely powerful and incontrovertible evidence of his osama bin ladens link to the events of the 11th of september
4743482 there is no evidence presented in the dossier that directly links bin laden to september 11
4743483 there was no doubt of bin ladens responsibility for the september 11 attacks before the tape was discovered
4743484 the american translators who listened to the tapes and transcribed them apparently wrote a lot of things in that they wanted to hear but that cannot be heard on the tape no matter how many times you listen to it
4743485 the reason why 9 11 is not mentioned on osama bin ladens most wanted page is because the fbi has no hard evidence connecting bin laden to 9 11
4743486 bin laden has not been formally charged in connection with 9 11
4743487 the fbi gathers evidence once evidence is gathered it is turned over to the department of justice the department of justice then decides whether it has enough evidence to present to a federal grand jury in the case of the 1998 united states embassies being bombed bin laden has been formally indicted and charged by a grand jury he has not been formally indicted and charged in connection with 9 11 because the fbi has no hard evidence connecting bin laden to 9 11
4743488 we havent heard much from him i e bin laden and i wouldnt necessarily say hes at the center of any command structure and again i dont know where he is i ill repeat what i said i truly am not that concerned about him
4743489 a cautionary tale about rushing to judgement in attributing responsibility for a terrorist act
4743490 please contact me upon your return to the states so we can continue this dialogue
4743491 received all of the department of defense documents on able danger and had found no mention of atta
4743492 the 9 11 commission failed to recognize the sustained comprehensive efforts conducted by the intelligence community prior to 9 11 to penetrate the al qaeda organization
4743493 one of the most important pieces of evidence the fbi would ever discover allowing investigators to map the links of the al qaeda network all across the globe
4743494 did not rec ognize the significance of what they had
4743495 keen to reveal the ambiguous role of the cia and to restrain washington from extending the war to iraq and elsewhere
4743496 what went wrong the c i a and the failure of american intelligence
4743497 the great conspiracy the 9 11 news special you never saw
4743498 i was not involved in the september 11 attacks in the united states nor did i have knowledge of the attacks there exists a government within a government within the united states the united states should try to trace the perpetrators of these attacks within itself to the people who want to make the present century a century of conflict between islam and christianity that secret government must be asked as to who carried out the attacks the american system is totally in the control of the jews whose first priority is israel not the united states i have already said that we are not hostile to the united states we are against the system which makes other nations slaves of the united states or forces them to mortgage their political and economic freedom
4743499 al qaeda leaders say nuclear power stations were original targets

4743508 because of what happened in liechtenstein we will see a higher flow of funds into singapore the momentum is accelerating
4743509 in 2003 hong kong and singapore experienced a massive influx of capital apparently from european sources as the adoption of the savings tax directive began to seem a realistic possibility
4743510 families with undeclared money can run but they cannot hide
4743511 my recommendation is to come clean tax havens are pretty vulnerable to attack
4743512 they call us everything dirty lazy cant you get a better job you name it every name in the book
4743513 ive seen punches in the face pushing shoving why i couldnt tell you people are just really intoxicated if the drunks are getting kicked out from the bars were getting it we are because when theyre coming out of the bar theyre targeting us were someone they think thats lower than them that they can abuse and that happens a lot
4743514 if drunk means above 08 blood alcohol level then i would have been inebriated but i wasnt stupid inebriated there was no slurring or stumbling on my part
4743515 he was winding up like muhammad ali and you could see it coming and she had no idea he slapped her in the ass and she turned around and grabbed him and they got into fisticuffs and then he punched her in the face
4743516 he was trying to put on a show for his buddies thats what it seemed to me i saw the hit or slap im not the only one who saw it
4743517 the guy didnt even really look at me and he pointed to a cop over there and he rolled up his window
4743518 i said but the car is empty and he said well she knows where we are
4743519 i went back and said to the officer the gentleman who assaulted this woman is still there then he said the same thing its taken care of were all over it
4743520 so then i was like well im not going to drag you down by the nose he stayed right where he was
4743521 i said this lady was hit the one thats working there behind the hotdog stand and the guys behind her were laughing about it and he walked over about five minutes later to see how she was doing
4743522 i dont know which officer it was nothing was done about it i dont think she admitted to it happening she was more worried about creating a problem thats what we witnessed
4743523 i thought there would have been more proactive involvement by the police
4743524 maybe investigate a little bit shes crying shes scared she has to come back here every week and these guys will be back
4743525 i was really disgusted i cant believe the officers didnt respond someone needs to know
4743526 before we respond to the contents of the letter we wish to complete a review of the circumstances
4743527 it was nice of those fellows to write that letter
4743528 happens all the time anything we can do to help we will
4743529 but theres nothing shocking about it its typical shes not the first and she wont be the last
4743530 but i know better theyre out here spending their money and im here making it most people dont realize how much money we can take home
4743531 every time you call them on the phone to tell them that theres a fight on the street or the bouncers are calling theyre here just like that

4743540 we went through how we coached different things and how he was coaching it
4743541 we shared things i think we were able to reassure him that some of the things he was doing were good he was sound it was just a matter of getting the players in step
4743542 and we got a lot better on defense in dallas after that that was part of the reason i wanted to come here i wanted to repay marvin
4743543 you play defense with 11 guys not two or three
4743544 your eyes have to work to play defense you need 11 guys playing together mike is getting that across hes very confident in the approach and scheme he developed in dallas
4743545 mike was trained as a secondary coach so hes been great with our two young corners
4743546 i think were going to reap the benefit of two first round corners big time also the two safeties were drafted last year hes a teacher and hes very demanding hes getting our guys to do things right
4743547 theyve been beaten up so badly theyll do anything we ask of them if you tell them to do this they may not be able to do it but theyre going to try every single time to do it right
4743548 the medications we were using just basically discontinued working and he was in a lot of pain
4743549 i think he was definitely a favorite here in louisville because of the kids he produced and how he interacted with the kids
4743550 he was never aggressive with them even though they were not his own
4743551 he could keep order just by looking over his shoulder
4743552 anyway as the bible says god helps those who help themselves
4743553 no it doesnt thats aesops fables the bible has a lot about sitting around doing nothing while god decides what to do

4743559 que se aprueben los presupuestos es la garant a de que se puede abordar un nuevo modelo de financiaci n si no hay presupuestos nuevos no habr un nuevo modelo de financiaci n por lo tanto catalunya saldr perdiendo igual que el resto de comunidades aut nomas

4743569 its always great to start a season like that to connect with the team to connect with carson
4743570 i dont think the green bay fans were too happy they thought i was heckling them but i was pointing to my family
4743571 im not old enough to need that kind of compliment
4743572 it is an extremely harsh and stark environment to detain people seeking asylum while their applications for protection are determined
4743573 the very expensive security systems of the facility are quite unnecessary for the population who may be detained there
4743574 the damage that has been done to peoples mental and physical health by detaining them in remote high security detention centres such as this has been documented repeatedly
4743575 theres a fear that the whole commodity boom is going to end that the bubble is going to burst

4743585 madonna is een nieuwe ster aan het discofirmament en ik denk dat ze met een beetje geluk een heel eind kan komen niet alleen vanwege de sexy uitstraling van de zangeres maar ook omdat deze debuutelpee waarvoor ze zelf de helft van de nummers schreef beslist een goede indruk achterlaat geen simpele discodreunen maar swingende muziek waarover goed is nagedacht
4743586 ze heeft een geweldig lichaam waar je daadwerkelijk wat van kunt zien
4743587 als je dat doet hol je het clich van binnenuit uit
4743588 je bent niet langer gevangen in een beeld waar je nooit meer van loskomt op die manier maak je het vrouwbeeld leger het is een postmoderne strategie om te laten zien dat het beeld niet samenvalt met de werkelijkheid
4743589 dat is nu minder aan de orde er is zoveel veranderd
4743590 er zijn zoveel krachtige vrouwen bijgekomen dat de hele cultuur is veranderd madonna heeft een voortrekkersrol gehad op dat gebied
4743591 het lukt haar om in haar eigen leven meerdere rollen te combineren ze is n moeder n keiharde zakenvrouw n popster ze is een van de weinigen die daar in is geslaagd kijk maar naar de vrouwenbladen die staan bol van de artikelen over de vraag hoe je carri re en priv leven combineert zij laat zien dat je een seksuele vrouw kunt zijn ook als je vijftig bent ook als je kinderen hebt
4743592 in de jaren negentig sneed ze veel controversi le onderwerpen aan zo gaf ze homos een prominente plek in haar groep
4743593 in de homoscene speelde de discussie of ze homos gebruikte of emancipeerde maar ze heeft hen wel een stem en een plek gegeven en stak haar liefde voor homos nooit onder stoelen of banken ze liet zien dat de homoscene cool en hip is
4743594 het kruisigingsnummer bij haar laatste tour deed wel stof opwaaien maar dat was een rimpel in vergelijking met de stormen van vroeger
4743595 ze is de laatste jaren wat softer geworden maar ja ze is ook getrouwd en heeft kinderen gekregen in denk dat ze het niet meer nodig heeft om te shockeren ze heeft haar doel wel bereikt
4743596 het is duidelijk dat ze iets heeft laten doen maar of het om botox of een facelift gaat weet ik niet
4743597 van mij had het niet gehoeven ik vond het wel mooi dat ze een wat ouder gezicht kreeg
4743598 we hebben als vrouwen de stereotype vrouwbeelden achter ons gelaten maar er ligt nog steeds een enorme druk op het uiterlijk en ik betwijfel of madonna op dit gebied het voortouw zal nemen
4743599 een vrouwbeeld is iets van buiten waar je tegenaan kunt schoppen maar tegen je eigen lichaam kun je niet schoppen
4743600 ze staat voor intelligente goed gemaakte pop waarin ze humor met erotiek weet te combineren kom daar maar eens om in de verenigde staten ze kiest songs die zowel echte dansmuziek als een liedje zijn en weet precies hoe ze dat moet laten klinken ze heeft er een talent voor om de juiste mensen uit te zoeken om mee te werken met name in de jaren tachtig had ze daar een gelukkige hand van ray of light vind ik haar laatste goede album daarna heeft ze haar hand overspeeld qua hipheid ze was vaak een stap voor nu is ze haar grip een beetje kwijt mijn favoriete madonna nummers zijn oudjes into the groove en borderline into the groove heeft een fantastische productie het nummer bestaat uit drie stukjes en het is prachtig hoe ze van a naar b gaat en daarna kun je nauwelijks wachten op c dat zou je wel honderd keer achter elkaar willen horen
4743601 maar ik vind wel dat ze hele goede liedjes heeft gemaakt la isla bonita is misschien een fout nummer maar zomerser dan dat krijg je ze bijna niet vaak beginnen popsongs wat vaag maar het begin van een madonna nummer is altijd meteen goed zij weet de toon vanaf de eerste noten te zetten zodat je meteen in het nummer zit verder vind ik het tof dat ze met haar muziek steeds uitersten heeft opgezocht qua sound soms zelfs zozeer dat een deel van haar fans sommige van haar platen verschrikkelijk vindt mijn voorkeur gaat uit naar haar oude werk toen ze jonger en zwoeler was ik herinner me nog dat ik like a prayer heel gewaagd vond vanwege de clip en material girl vind ik echt het perfecte popliedje met een melodie die je niet meer uit je hoofd krijgt een prachtige clip en een supermooi meisje
4743602 en naar haar laatste cd hard candy al helemaal niet

4743605 compostela did not exist in the 2nd quarter of the 11th century the time of alfonso iii
4743606 the time has come the kingdom of god is near repent and believe the good news
4743607 we do not worship we do not adore for fear that we should bow down to the creature rather than to the creator but we venerate the relics of the martyrs in order the better to adore him whose martyrs they are
4743608 i said they cannot do this because of the sea
4743609 no mommy thats not true they can put these long colums in the sea and then simply build the streets on it and then they would have streets and cars
4743610 stressed why stressed during exam time want to stress also stress before exam mah and ponteng then
4743611 uh no more like i burned the midnight oil the night before and onlined too so i was too drowsy the next morning and slept in while planning to study later after all the teachers arent teaching much anymore cause theyve covered the syllabus already and all i usually do in class is get carried away talking to friends no studying gets done at all
4743612 but once it goes over cuba it looks like it will affect florida in some form or fashion
4743613 but its not out of the question that it could be a hurricane over florida that is certainly a possibility
4743614 once the content is re packaged in beijing it is fed to the nbc studios in new york where the content is pushed to the nbcolympics com portal for the ott distribution others take it from there
4743615 we have had a team of engineers on site for over three months final tests of equipment took place two weeks before so far all is going well
4743616 with the cisco network solution weve achieved the holy grail of digital video which is the ability to perform shot selections on low res files and extract high res material from those files even as they are being recorded thats a huge accomplishment
4743617 msn is providing distribution of nbc olympics video content which lives exclusively on the msn network to all of our u s visitors
4743618 this was a strong cross company effort with many people and teams working together to make microsofts and nbcs coverage of the 2008 olympic games a reality
4743619 weve been in business over seven years and have over 1 300 customers including some of the largest names in the business disney fox netflix and other large content providers
4743620 were responsible for delivering some 3 600 hours of content live as well as storing all the on demand content so that when a viewer wants to replay something they just have to click
4743621 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4743622 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4743623 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4743624 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4743625 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4743626 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4743627 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4743628 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4743629 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4743630 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4743631 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4743632 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4743633 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4743634 hell either go to france and then the dewhurst stakes or france and then the racing post trophy
4743635 while making the first part i and my writer sachindra sharma decided that if the film becomes a hit we will go for its sequel since the film was a big hit we made the sequel and now we will launch the third part
4743636 we have a secret weapon we shall cease to be your enemy
4743637 stocks have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau
4743638 the court considers that the defendants are still in the courts jurisdiction because the defendants had surrendered to authorities and the court had granted them bail
4743639 the court still has jurisdiction to proceed with the case and there is no reason to dismiss the case
4743640 weve been linked with pandiani but i can honestly say to you his name has never been mentioned in the eight months ive been at the club
4743641 in fact to be perfectly honest ive forgotten he existed ive no idea where he plays and its rather strange to say to me weve been linked with this player and that player when i have no idea where that comes from
4743642 the ground has changed overnight to heavy as theyve had a good bit of rain
4743643 i wanted to prove myself abroad and the premier league is where most of the stars if the national teams play
4743644 now i am here i just want to score goals for wigan i have come here with a big reputation but i wont say how many goals i will score that is not my way
4743645 it may take me some time to become the no 1 striker in the premier league but that is what i want to be
4743646 it wasnt an easy deal to do but i think it is going to be worth it
4743647 zamalek wanted 6 5 million for him but we werent going to pay that for a striker who has yet to prove himself abroad even if he is treated like the king of egypt at home
4743648 that would be the best for me and it would allow some of the other boys in team calzaghe to get a good showing in front of the welsh fans
4743649 everyone who knows me thinks of me as a nice guy outside the ring but at this point in time i cant wait to get in the ring and do some damage
4743650 banks is facing someone that is very very fired up right now my nasty head is ridiculous at the moment just watch me in the gym and you will see everything im hitting is full of nasty intent
4743651 the fight was going to be alexander alekseev because banks wouldnt have been ready in time after his last fight
4743652 but now it has been put back he banks has accepted the fight
4743653 my wish is to do well is to do well enough here so rangers take up the option to buy me
4743654 there were other clubs interested in greece and spain but the only club i was interested in signing for was rangers
4743655 its a really big club and when i found out the manager had been watching me for a while i took notice of that
4743656 aaron is one of my boys he played for me at under 17 and under 19 level and he is a very very good player
4743657 his main focus is to play in an attacking and creative way and he has great skills
4743658 aarons ability is fantastic and as well as creating goals for other members of his team he can also be a strong scorer himself for rangers
4743659 he has matured in a good way and that has pleased me as he was playing for valencia in the champions league at a very young age that was an incredible and terrific achievement for aaron
4743660 marc has excellent ability and talent he likes to try and control the midfield area and he can make creative passes as well as keep possession
4743661 it was not easy for him at barcelona with players such as xavi and iniesta ahead of him and he could not get a regular opportunity but that does not mean he cannot be of big value
4743662 this is a prime example of how able forensic investigations is concerned with the well being of the children of the community and the importance of participation in pro bono community services
4743663 in this case our backrgound and success within the field of private investigations as well as our reputation within the community has allowed us the honor to participate in these intiiatives
4743664 ive been saying that since 1989 you will be able to say
4743665 i would like to go to amman to stand trial however what i fear is that i am convicted in advance
4743666 highlight that there are some terrorists who misuse islam and they take it as their spiritual ammunition
4743667 i wanted to depict the terrorists as if they were taking the prophet mohammad as a hostage i have no problem with islam but with the terrorists
4743668 i respect islam and its followers and i have nothing against it however i will not apologise we have freedom of the press and religion in denmark i cant apologise i respect islam and i did not target it
4743669 if you look at folks of color even women theyre more successful in the democratic party than they are in the white uh excuse me in the laughs republican party

4743674 we love using nobelcom services my wife calls her family in south africa at least once a week and we have been using nobelcom since 2003 nobelcom consistently has the lowest prices and the highest quality connections we always recommend nobelcom to our friends and family and we will continue using nobelcom to satisfy our need for international calling cards
4743675 be honest id never ever taken part in such adventure as a lottery or special games from business because of different reasons and stereotypes but you gave me an opportunity to change my opinion and hope in luck further first of all i should thank your team with great service that allows many people to connect with ease with their parents relatives friends worldwide and youre the one from the small amount of companies that running business with respect responsibility to each single customer and creative ideas which make our daily routines brighter and full of hope as in childhood

4743933 i appeal to all political parties to keep the long term interests of jammu and kashmir in view and come together to find a permanent solution to the problems of the state the sacred shrine of shri amarnath inspires all indians to march together this shrine is a shining example of our secular tradition where hindu pilgrims have been looked after for years by their muslim brothers
4743934 i really enjoy this occasion because this marks the love between a brother and sister its basically a bond that ties us
4743935 we are very happy that the army is there because of this the supply of items is returning back to normalcy
4743936 the truck drivers who came from the route earlier told us that the protesters were breaking the glass panes and burning vehicles so we stayed back and did not move now after the army was deployed all along the route we started our journey
4743937 shes fucking retarded i could say anything i want to her bitch cock balls dick
4743938 if i was there id punch me in the face
4743939 hey bear i know youre there and im not even slightly interested in you or your cub

4743941 not just as a car but as a way of life
4743942 usually 2cv owners dont get tickets policeman just smile almost everybody in france had a 2cv at some time in their youth so theyre nostalgic and not angry with us
4743943 the 2cv is a symbol of france i mean like the eiffel tower or the french baguette
4743944 when you are in a 2cv you escape it is an experience in itself its an adventure and you feel like youre in a cosy cocoon
4743945 the liberals will therefore legislate to bring in a requirement that elections be held in february or march every four years
4743946 the race will be timed to follow on from the melbourne cup and will form the centrepiece of an international festival celebrating the best that western australian racing and pacing has to offer
4743947 so far all we are getting from the opposition are vague ideas and half baked concepts
4743948 its very emotive coming back we have very strong memories when i heard the shots i felt terribly sad that it had been discovered
4743949 these next races are win at all costs just get the wins and get the bonus points
4743950 theres no way to tell right now whos got the best chance of winning the championship
4743951 theres enough teams that are running well and right now theres a number of teams that can win every week it seems like theres more people getting stronger as we go
4743952 michigan has always been a favorite of mine and my team roush fenway racing
4743953 i think well have a pretty good shot at winning sunday which of course would help us close the gap on kyle in the chase deal
4743954 the bonus points are going to be a pretty big deal
4743955 if you start 60 70 100 points ahead of the other guys it will be a great way to start the chase just being ahead will give you some breathing room we have to focus on doing all that we can to get more bonus points that will be pretty big heading into the chase
4743956 the best way for us to make the chase is to remain consistent with our race car each and every race its a tough battle right now
4743957 its a really fun track and it puts on really good races i like racing there and i look forward to it every time

4743964 the finding is significant because it changes our understanding of how light input from the eye can affect activity and sleep patterns
4743965 this suggests that we have discovered an additional mechanism for regulating nocturnity and diurnity that is located in the light input pathways of the eye
4743966 the significance of this research for humans is that it could ultimately lead to new treatments for sleep disorders perhaps even eye drops that would target neural pathways to the brains central timekeeper

4744003 what you have is really terror in the worst sense of the word a million people have been displaced that the ethiopians have been denying humanitarian aid and the united states which seems to just watch and let it happen

4744019 por esto dejar el hombre a su padre y a su madre y se unir a su mujer y ser n los dos una sola carne
4744020 de modo que ya no son dos sino una carne pues bien lo que dios junt el hombre no lo separe

4744034 its a great to be back on the ice and its a good week to go through organized practices that help all of us get ready for training camp said former spartan captain shawn horcoff who recently signed a five year contract extension with the nhls edmonton oilers
4744035 plus its great to see all the guys relive old stories and to get to know the new players were all spartans and part of a great family
4744036 ive been working out off the ice but i just got cleared to get back on the ice and its good to be out here with the guys said horcoff who makes his offseason home in the detroit suburb of birmingham
4744037 i remember when i first started coming i was one of the youngest he said
4744038 this is a good way to get in game shape for camp its organized and you want to work hard
4744039 im just trying to learn everything i can and be as ready as i can for rookie camp said bryan lerg who signed with edmonton as a free agent and reports sept
4744040 ive talked to shawn horcoff and matt greene about the tests drills and what camp is like lerg said
4744041 horc just said be in the best shape you can in and be ready to work hard
4744042 this week has been challenging because its our first real tests five days in a row and two hours on the ice said miller 28 who still makes his offseason home in east lansing
4744043 with regimented drills you can focus a little more for me on my balance
4744044 were looking forward to having more guys in town on the weekend and spinning this into a reunion where guys can play golf relax and catch up
4744045 number one its for the guys to get a chance to get back on the ice get a feel for the game again and work at a good level before they head off to training camp newton said
4744046 and two its to keep the players involved and close to the program so they know how important they are to what were doing they get to see former teammates and get to know the younger guys
4744047 the players asked us what they could do to help the program and this is what we came up with msu coach rick comley said
4744048 when you walk in there you go wow whenever you can add wow to your program its great
4744049 fans will really love it and players love working on shootout moves in practice so theyll love doing it in a game
4744050 think of it everything you had worked for for 10 years coming down to one jump dan gould an msu professor who serves as forresters mental training coach said in an e mail from south africa where hes teaching this summer
4744051 she did a great job of following her normal mental preparation routine keeping her focus in the present by focusing on a few process goals and blocking out the ramifications of the outcome
4744052 everyone keeps asking me that question and i have been kind of mum on exactly what it is i think ultimately its just about leaving it all on the track and not feeling like i could have done better she said last week in an interview with yorkregional com a canadian web site
4744053 the process was quite long but well worth it she said on her blog at nicoleforrester
4744054 walking into the stadium was a proud moment i waved my canada thundersticks with enthusiasm and canadian pride ironically landing me a spot on television
4744055 as i stood shoulder to shoulder with athletes spanning the globe the emotion i felt as i saw the torch i cannot find the words to explain it was a unique and special experience my feelings were expressed in the tears that surprisingly streamed down my face
4744056 she is a very goal oriented organized individual which you would have to be to be able to handle things as an elite athlete and ph d student said deborah feltz a professor and the chairperson of msus department of kinesiology and forresters academic adviser
4744057 there are some universities that require you to pursue your olympic dream and then do a ph
4744058 it might take a bit longer but it was possible
4744059 we also had in common our love for research and track and field nicole in high jump and me pursuing middle distance running at the senior olympics level
4744060 she has networks all over the place within our department and on campus in other departments as well as at michigan feltz said
4744061 after hearing me discuss the research in class and reading the articles i published on the topic she asked if id be willing to help her apply some of the principles derived in her own quest to make the canadian olympic team gould said in an e mail
4744062 she was also interested from an academic perspective as she wants to study how people move from being good to great
4744063 my work with nicole is one part of a team of people who help her her coach strength and conditioning specialists and message therapists gould said

4744086 wir haben die gesamte anlage automatisiert von dem punkt an dem wir einen stamm in den h cksler einf hren bis zu dem an dem am ende ein ballen zellstoff herauskommt
4744087 unser ziel war die modernste technik auf dem markt einzusetzen und sie so gut wie m glich zu nutzen um dadurch jedes teilprojekt zu vereinfachen angefangen beim engineering ber die konfiguration bis zur inbetriebnahme
4744088 wir haben uns f r die digitale plantweb architektur entschieden weil wir die modernste verf gbare technik in unserer anlage einsetzen wollten f r schnelles kalibrieren und hochfahren
4744089 die gesamte anlage wurde optimiert vom einsatz der st mme am eingang bis zum versand des zellstoffs am ende dies spart entscheidend an betriebskosten und anfahrzeiten die kalibrierzeit f r ein messinstrument wurde um ein drittel verk rzt und die konfiguration von motorsteuerungen mcc f r 30 motoren kostet uns jetzt einen halben tag verglichen mit zwei bis vier wochen als wir noch keine intelligente motorsteuerung hatten die konfiguration eines regelventils wurde drastisch verk rzt in fr heren projekten haben wir einen halben tag damit verbracht das ventil auf den arbeitspunkt einzustellen heute dr cken wir einen knopf und es kalibriert sich selbst
4744090 trotz des immensen umfangs ging das projekt zum geplanten zeitpunkt in betrieb das lag zum gro en teil an der exzellenten unterst tzung die wir von emerson erhielten
4744091 wir haben alle unsere ziele erreicht die anlage ist auf den aussto von 856 000 t a kraft zellstoff ausgelegt in nur sechs monaten nach der inbetriebnahme hatten wir 93 8 dieses ziels auf monatsbasis erreicht seitdem haben die die produktion auf den planwert hochgefahren ich bin stolz an diesem projekt beteiligt gewesen zu sein
4744092 deltav bietet uns eine kommunikations architektur die uns erlaubt ger te vieler verschiedener hersteller mit verschiedenen protokollen anzuschlie en
4744093 diese tatsache hat uns im projektverlauf sehr geholfen und erlaubt uns in der zukunft neue ger te zu integrieren auch k nnen wir mit emersons ams suite fehler der instrumente genau diagnostizieren das hilft unserer wartungsmannschaft ihre produktivit t zu steigern

4744097 la semaine derni re lorsque la californie l tat de r sidence de yahoo avait rejoint l tat du massachusetts ainsi que le canada les pays bas la norv ge lafrique du sud et lespagne en adoptant la reconnaissance juridique des mariages gay les v nements de la pride annuels qui se tiennent en juin ont imm diatement pris une signification particuli re pour plein de gens y compris les employ s de yahoo leurs amis leurs familles et leurs partisans
4744098 with pride events scattered around the globe and throughout the year we thought our local festivities would be the perfect opportunity to re launch yahoos annual pride site with some fun new additions at its first permanent destination
4744099 avec des v nements de la pride r partis tout autour de la plan te et tout au long de lann e on a pens que nos festivit s locales seraient la meilleure opportunit pour relancer le site annuel de la pride de yahoo avec de nouvelles fonctionnalit s amusantes et sa avec son premier site permanent
4744100 i think that pride is part of humility communautarism is the main way to division why do gays need to exhibit their sexual orientation and why do religious have to show their religious convictions im totally against the fact that such a company defends division and splitting inside the society by promoting such things convictions are personal
4744101 je pense que la fiert fait partie dhumilit le communautarisme est voix qui m ne vers la division
4744102 echoing the voices of an abused group of human beings asking to be treated equally
4744103 gays are part of our society that can not be excluded and they have all rights to have their own yahoo feature or site if you will
4744104 pourquoi est ce que les gays ont besoin dexposer leur orientation sexuelle et pourquoi les religieux doivent ils montrer leurs convictions religieuses

4744120 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4744121 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4744122 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4744123 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4744124 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4744125 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4744126 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4744129 he was a man who kept himself to himself but he was friendly he always said hello
4744130 its amazing he was not extravagant he was quite a reserved man but he was pleasant
4744131 we are very grateful to william kinghorn for his generous legacy
4744132 gifts left in wills are extremely important to the charity
4744133 the time we spent in the village opened my eyes to another way of life the people really made us feel welcome and showed great hospitality i felt like a member of the community and will never forget our time there
4744134 weve met some amazing people and seen how they live which has made me realise that we are only a tiny part of the world and that we should open our eyes to other cultures it was an experience i wont forget
4744135 these two weeks have been one of the best experiences of my life there were many challenges we had to face and not many people can say they camped in the sahara desert in temperatures of over 50c working in the village was so rewarding knowing how much it was appreciated
4744136 mohamed made the trip so special and thrilling a once in a lifetime trip by showing us the different cultures and environments of morocco including the sweltering camel trip in the sahara and aguersioual village in the atlas mountains i want to go back to the country and the village
4744137 this was another example of just how adaptable our young people are they went with open minds and realised just how much people from much poorer backgrounds have and how much we can learn from this
4744138 this is the fifth world expedition i have organised in the geography department and i feel really privileged to be able to show people from barrow very different sides of life i maintain that travelling doesnt necessarily broaden the mind because your mind needs to be open in the first place
4744139 our experience with other lines holds true for this one too that the initial benefit is economic and social

4744151 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
4744152 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
4744153 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
4744154 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will

4744162 the governor has said for awhile now that higher graduation rates are a priority for his administration and will be a priority in the session
4744163 the bottom line is we have to increase the number of adults in the state with college degrees

4744172 where do you want to be financially the next two years
4744173 when scientific power outruns moral power we end up with guided missiles and misguided men when we foolishly minimize the internal of our lives and maximize the external we sign the warrant for our own day of doom our hope for creative living in this world house that we have inherited lies in our ability to re establish the moral ends of our lives in personal character and social justice without this spiritual and moral reawakening we shall destroy ourselves in the misuse of our own instruments
4744174 it is the sane ones the well adapted ones who can without qualms and without nausea aim the missiles and press the buttons that will initiate the great festival of destruction that they the sane ones have prepared
4744175 is the sco turning into a nato north atlantic treaty organization like military alliance
4744176 we and china are analyzing the us global missile defense plans targeting europe and the east
4744177 israel has decided to erect a missile shield its about time and who would blame her for defending herself
4744178 we are concerned about the decision to deploy the system and are at one with the large majority of our populations in rejecting it
4744179 should any country deploy weapons in space then the laws of armed warfare are such that retaliatory weapons are certain to appear
4744180 our intelligence community assess that with continued foreign assistance iran could develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the united states and all of europe before 2015
4744181 we have not fully developed this proposal but the idea was we would go forward with the negotiations we would complete the negotiations we would develop the sites build the sites but perhaps we would delay activating them until there was concrete proof of the threat from iran
4744182 i do not think we will be able to conclude an agreement by the end of the year
4744183 have not only not been suspended but additional measures are being taken to speed them up
4744184 there is the impression that the united states is trying to make the realization of its plans irreversible
4744185 during the course of an october 17 2007 press conference president bush jr
4744186 you would have to be very naive to assume that the american missile defense base in europe is aimed against anything but russia its difficult to interpret it as anything other than a manifestation of imperial thinking
4744187 the entire system is directed against russia and china thats how we understand it
4744188 the iranians wont rush to attack israel because they understand the significance such action would have and are well aware of our strength
4744189 however iran continues to aggravate the situation by supplying arms to syria and hezbollah and we must deal with this
4744190 i wont hide the fact that one of the most difficult issues was and remains the american missile defense system in europe i want to be understood correctly there has been no change in our fundamental attitude to the american plans
4744191 we have asked the us for cooperation in the acquisition of two mid range tactical transport planes and that should be raised in the framework of anti missile defence negotiations
4744192 missile defense is the most difficult development the pentagon has ever attempted
4744193 the program offers no prospect of defending the united states from a real world missile attack and undermines efforts to eliminate the real nuclear threats to the united states
4744194 cowardice asks the question is it safe expediency asks the question is it politic vanity asks the question is it popular but conscience asks the question is it right and there comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe nor politic nor popular but one must take it because ones conscience tells one that it is right
4744195 the movie touched by love was based on the book to elvis with love lena canadas now very rare memoir tells the powerful true story of lenas friendship and love for karen the young girl crippled and dying from the effects of cerebral palsy it is also the story of the power that elvis holds for many people in karens case the exchange of letters and gifts between elvis and her bring incredible joy and happiness to the remainder of her greatly shortened life
4744196 rockin on music if you like it if you feel it you cant help but move to it thats what happens to me i cant stand still ive tried it and i just cant do it
4744197 his kind of music is deplorable a rancid smelling aphrodisiac it fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people
4744198 i wanted to say to elvis presley and the country that this is a real decent fine boy
4744199 elvis was the king no doubt about it people like myself mick jagger and all the others only followed in his footsteps
4744200 a presley picture is the only sure thing in hollywood
4744201 a lot of people have accused elvis of stealing the black mans music when in fact almost every black solo entertainer copied his stage mannerisms from elvis
4744202 when i first heard elvis voice i just knew that i wasnt going to work for anybody and nobody was going to be my boss hearing him for the first time was like busting out of jail
4744203 elvis is the greatest cultural force in the twentieth century he introduced the beat to everything music language clothes its a whole new social revolution the 60s comes from it
4744204 there have been many accolades uttered about elvis talent and performances through the years all of which i agree with wholeheartedly i shall miss him dearly as a friend he was a warm considerate and generous man
4744205 elvis presleys death deprives our country of a part of itself he was unique irreplaceable more than twenty years ago he burst upon the scene with an impact that was unprecedented and will probably never be equaled his music and his personality fusing the styles of white country and black rhythm and blues permanently changed the face of american popular culture his following was immense and he was a symbol to people the world over of the vitality rebelliousness and good humor of this country
4744206 if life was fair elvis would be alive and all the impersonators would be dead
4744207 well never know what an old elvis presley would have been like hell just always be the king

4744216 with billions of people living on just dollars a day around the world global poverty remains one of the greatest challenges and tragedies the international community faces it must be a priority of american foreign policy to commit to eliminating extreme poverty and ensuring every child has food shelter and clean drinking water

4744221 do you think depaul university in chicago should keep the minutemen from having their speaker there monday
4744222 cris simcox who is the minuteman militia corps leader has been invited to speak by a conservative group at depaul university on may 19th 2008 simcox is well known for his anti immigrant sentiment against mexicans simcox travels the country recruiting members and has had growing involvement in his group of racist border vigilantes white supremacist groups have openly recruited members for the minuteman patrols groups like neo nazis from the national alliance amp aryan nations simcox as of today refuses to acknowledge that vigilante border patrols are a haven for violent racist many groups have asked the university to cancel simcoxs invitation but depaul university refuses amp say that they must allow all groups on campus exercise the right to freedom of speech

4744224 when measured on an inflation adjusted basis the current price of gasoline is only slightly higher about 20 percent than it was in 1922 according to the energy information administration in 1922 gasoline cost the current day equivalent of 3 11
4744225 today gasoline is selling for about 3 77 per gallon given the ever increasing global demand for oil products during the first three months of this year chinas oil consumption jumped 16 5 percent and the increasing costs associated with finding producing and refining crude oil it makes sense that todays motorists are paying more for their motor fuel than their grandparents and great grandparents did
4744226 i was just wondering what your opinion is on the two young hispanic gentlemen that were killed in a car accident that was caused by a white chicago police officer i believe that he is about to get off scott free

4744229 theoretically there is nothing that can stop the government from taxing 100 of income so long as the people get benefits from the government commensurate with their income which is taxed
4744230 i do not see why the government cannot tax those who have more and syphon some of these revenues into savings which can be utilized in investment for future development

4744240 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4744241 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4744242 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4744243 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4744244 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4744245 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4744246 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4744247 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4744248 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4744249 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation

4744264 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4744265 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4744266 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4744267 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4744268 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4744269 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4744270 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes

4744276 if a sub region succeeds to solve a problem in a country of the same region we will applaud
4744277 but we monitor we have to watch shouldnt the process be successful we will intervene
4744278 what we think is we need to have a real debate about the issue and that includes a real look at the costs of some of the policies being promoted
4744279 lets look at taking whatever revenue is derived from that and devote it entirely to tax relief
4744280 we think that there are solutions to whatever the climate crisis may be that are market based that dont involve increasing the size of government substantially
4744281 do we want to create a model where the solutions for dependence on oil come out of europe or asia and were sitting here in the u s because we want to argue for the status quo
4744282 the scientific data show the change is accelerating so when you do take measures the longer you delay the more aggressive those measures have to be
4744283 its important to address those issues sooner rather than later
4744284 if the united states congress would have the backbone enough to announce to this world that we are going to deregulate and we are going to begin to drill and refine american oil we would begin to see gas prices plummet
4744285 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes

4744291 yes i believe in it as an institution but its not for me

4744297 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment

4744304 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
4744305 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
4744306 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4744307 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4744308 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4744309 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4744310 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4744311 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4744312 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4744313 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4744314 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4744315 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4744316 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4744317 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4744318 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4744319 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4744320 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4744321 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4744322 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4744323 we were quite nervous beforehand we got a loan of a giant tv screen had the room blacked out and had it all set up like a sports bar but we were very good we didnt pop any corks until after the final
4744324 the good thing about it is being a sprint its all over quite quickly but it seems a lot longer at the time
4744325 we just went wild when they won it was just fantastic we could see his mum dad sister and sarra his girlfriend jumping up in beijing with their flags just like we were so it was just like being there its superb
4744326 to beat them by half a second made it that exciting honestly it took every inch of effort in beating the french who have been invincible
4744327 theres still plenty in the tank if i get three golds ill do a dance for you and thats a promise
4744328 theyre up on cloud nine it was such a fantastic result for him on the first day
4744329 weve got another four days of this i dont think i can stand it
4744330 he was always very quick and very determined even when he was just a wee boy on his bmx he was terrifically competitive right from the start
4744331 chris hoys magnificent achievement in beijing has made edinburgh proud congratulations to him and his team on their olympic triumph
4744332 these robotic policemen wiped out all of cambridge in one day of carnage what have you got to say about that
4744333 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4744334 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4744335 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4744336 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4744337 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4744338 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4744339 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4744340 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4744341 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4744342 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4744343 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4744344 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4744345 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4744346 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4744347 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4744348 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4744349 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4744350 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4744351 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4744352 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4744353 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4744354 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4744355 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4744356 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4744357 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4744358 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4744359 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4744360 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4744361 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4744362 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4744363 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4744364 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4744365 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4744366 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4744367 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4744368 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4744369 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4744370 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4744371 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4744372 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4744373 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4744374 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4744375 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4744376 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4744377 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4744378 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4744379 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4744380 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4744381 just so you all know we did set a record
4744382 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4744383 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4744384 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4744385 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4744386 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
4744387 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
4744388 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
4744389 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4744390 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
4744391 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4744392 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4744393 and captains of work must always be but there is a wide difference between being captains of work and taking the profits of it
4744394 even a great mistake a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too
4744395 so are you saying that were all just like really excellent sheep
4744396 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
4744397 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
4744398 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
4744399 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
4744400 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
4744401 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4744402 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
4744403 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4744404 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4744405 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4744406 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4744407 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4744408 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4744409 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4744410 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4744411 this bookstore is one of the very few places that encourage us to stay in lebanon
4744412 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
4744413 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
4744414 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
4744415 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
4744416 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
4744417 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4744418 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4744419 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
4744420 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
4744421 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
4744422 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
4744423 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
4744424 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
4744425 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4744426 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
4744427 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4744428 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4744429 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4744430 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4744431 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4744432 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4744433 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4744434 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4744435 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4744436 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4744437 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4744438 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4744439 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4744440 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4744441 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4744442 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4744443 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4744444 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4744445 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
4744446 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
4744447 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
4744448 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
4744449 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
4744450 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
4744451 still there are a few high profile names outstanding al gores most of all though a democratic involved in planning
4744452 north pole may be ice free for first time this summer
4744453 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
4744454 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
4744455 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter
4744456 what happens is the water tunnels to the bottom and makes the ice like swiss cheese sort of like termites
4744457 id be remiss if i didnt say hello buddy cianci mayor of providence
4744458 i want you to know i was wearing my rhode island democrats t shirt when i was exercising this morning put that in the paper
4744459 i get amused when i see that stern faced young man from colorado extolling the merits of assault weapons
4744460 i didnt see any donkeys although we heard a weird sound when we first got in here
4744461 they must have you know seen me coming but they all hid somewhere
4744462 i dont care if you have jesus christ in the van
4744463 no i know if i needed to get out id make my way out just as i made my way in you have to see the possibilities
4744464 if my opponent had been there at the moon launch it would have been called a risky rocket scheme
4744465 if hed been there when edison was testing the light bulb it would have been a risky anti candle scheme
4744466 and if hed been there when the internet was invented
4744467 there was a ramp that went over the rubble my son brendan and i were able to come here and all the world stops when we had whole bodies or something that would resemble a whole body and people would line up on each side of this makeshift ramp and i went down with my son brendan and we were able to collect jonathan he was already in a basket and ive got to stop for a second so we were able to go down spend a little time and then brendan and myself and some of the guys in jons company we carried him up put him in an ambulance and took jon away we were blessed in a way because my son was a whole body
4744468 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
4744469 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4744470 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4744471 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
4744472 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
4744473 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
4744474 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
4744475 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
4744476 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
4744477 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
4744478 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4744479 says he has all the answers and it will only cost 3 trillion
4744480 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4744481 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4744482 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
4744483 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4744484 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4744485 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4744486 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4744487 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
4744488 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4744489 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4744490 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
4744491 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4744492 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4744493 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4744494 what the hell is a buckeye anyway is that some kind of pirate satch
4744495 its a pea whats so scary about a pea thats the worst mascot ever im going to kick that peas ass
4744496 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4744497 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
4744498 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
4744499 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
4744500 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
4744501 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
4744502 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
4744503 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
4744504 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
4744505 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
4744506 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012
4744507 christopher doesnt see women for what they should be he sees women for who they can be
4744508 what do you want your look to say to people
4744509 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
4744510 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
4744511 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
4744512 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
4744513 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
4744514 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
4744515 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4744516 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4744517 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4744518 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4744519 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4744520 its okay hes probably in a hurry to have sex with a sheep
4744521 i saw this story in the paper this morning and i knew it just had to make it onto tonights show
4744522 hey esther can you get in the car for a second

4744551 we simply cant go on ignoring you at the old rates across the world the cost of ignoring is soaring to record prices and weve all seen the reports from south america and india where some people havent been ignored for over a month so if we are to fulfil our historic role of telling you to piss off you will have to increase your contributions
4744552 brothers and sisters i can promise you your union is working night and day in an effort to be utterly humiliated and ignored just this morning i personally spent two hours ringing a british telecom call centre and listened to 11 tracks of celine dion and a whole movement of vivaldi without once getting through

4744556 lift the curtain of secrecy that the british government has thrown over its use of chemical weapons against unsuspecting prisoners

4744561 not enough was known about its carcinogenic and mutanogenic effects

4744563 the chemical has already been issued to long kesh military guards and will be used in the event of serious rioting
4744564 based on a conviction that mainstream newspapers and broadcasters provide a profoundly distorted picture of our world that is increasingly centralised the corporate nature of the media means that it acts as a de facto propaganda system for corporate and other establishment interests the costs incurred as a result of this propaganda in terms of human suffering and environmental degradation are incalculable
4744565 there is always some element of bad form in objecting to the destructive course of events or indeed in making it a topic of conversation thus in nazi germany even among those most closely identified with the final solution it was considered an act of discourtesy to talk about the killings
4744566 america still fields what is arguably the most disciplined humane military force in history a model of restraint compared with ancient armies that wallowed in the spoils of war or even more modern armies that heedlessly killed civilians and prisoners
4744567 my god what are the folks who live here going to say when they see this
4744568 the city is today totally ruined falluja is our dresden in iraq the population is full of rage
4744569 the american armys use of its massive fire power is so unrestrained that all us military operations are in reality the collective punishment of whole districts towns and cities
4744570 as untermenschen they are not concerned about the iraqi loss of life their attitude toward the iraqis is tragic it is awful
4744571 they were all civilians and had no links with taliban or al qaeda
4744572 in close quarter firefights where friendly soldiers could be wounded if bombs are used cannon fire and missiles are often the preferred alternative
4744573 however 47 civilians most of them women and children were killed when a us aircraft bombed a wedding party in eastern afghanistan on sunday an afghan government investigation has concluded the nine man investigation team found that only civilians were hit during the airstrike
4744574 a hundred per cent feminine very pretty very unassuming a natural person very happy the sort of person that when she was in a room it lit up
4744575 regional officials said the casualties were attending a wedding party and that the bride had been killed
4744576 i accept your point about not mentioning women and children although in my defence the story was linked to the new story and i didnt necessarily want to repeat the details
4744577 thanks for your response i appreciate it but something doesnt add up how often did the media provide us with the personal details name gender photo education work lives loved ones aspirations of the victims of the july 7 bomb attacks in london see here http news bbc co uk 2 shared spl hi uk 05 london blasts victims default stm the july 6 atrocity in afghanistan has been reported a tiny handful of times in the press why would you be concerned about repeating the fact that almost all of the victims were women and children
4744578 the latest claim of civilian casualties puts yet more pressure on the afghan authorities and international forces to get it right when carrying out operations
4744579 yet more pressure on saddam hussein and the iraqi forces to get it right when carrying out operations in kuwait
4744580 the un said last month that nearly 700 afghan civilians had lost their lives in afghanistan this year about two thirds in attacks by militants and about 255 in military operations
4744581 kosovo albanians have been welcoming the return of armed kla soldiers
4744582 its these mistakes that cost the us the support of the afghan people
4744583 as is so often the case in this conflict its the iraqi civilian population which suffers the greatest loss of life either as a result of mistakes by the americans or far more frequently of course as a result of the bombs and the bullets of the insurgents
4744584 the more vulgar apologists for u s and israeli crimes solemnly explain that while arabs purposely kill people the u s and israel being democratic societies do not intend to do so their killings are just accidental ones hence not at the level of moral depravity of their adversaries
4744585 much as we do the ants we crush while walking down a street we are aware that it is likely to happen if we bother to think about it but we do not intend to kill them because they are not worthy of such consideration

4744605 mary being assumed into heaven shows us the ultimate goal of our pilgrimage on earth she reminds us that our whole being spirit soul and body is destined for the fullness of life that those who live and die in love of god and neighbor will be transformed in the image of the glorious body of the risen christ the lord who humbles the proud and extols the lowly cf luke 1 51 52 this is what the virgin proclaims forever in the mystery of her assumption may you always be praised o virgin mary pray to the lord for us
4744606 as we celebrate the solemnity of the assumption of the blessed virgin we are invited to raise our eyes to heaven and contemplate mary the mother of jesus and our mother she who on earth believed in gods word is now glorified in body and soul
4744607 may marys prayers and example guide you always and renew your hearts in faith and hope may god grant you and your families abundant blessings of peace and joy
4744608 although the church has contributed much to the development of culture experience shows that because of circumstances it is sometimes difficult to harmonize culture with christian teaching
4744609 these difficulties do not necessarily harm the life of faith indeed they can stimulate the mind to a more accurate and penetrating grasp of the faith for recent studies and findings of science history and philosophy raise new questions which influence life and demand new theological investigations
4744610 let the children come to me and do not prevent them for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these
4744611 as well as the huge financial deal scappaticci has also been given a new home a new job a new identity and a new face thanks to plastic surgery
4744612 if any such story containing details of scappaticcis whereabouts or photographs of him was ever published it would pose a direct and very grave threat to scappaticcis life and possibly also to the lives of others
4744613 the security service clearly see this quite literally as a matter of life and death
4744614 this case is one of many that has left many very serious questions unanswered
4744615 we have a number of clients with both interests in this case and others who want answers but are hitting a brick wall one of the problems of the aftermath of the conflict is that no one wants to tell the truth about what went on
4744616 how can all sides of the community be expected to walk into a brave new post conflict world while the answer to these questions are still outstanding
4744617 freddie has been given a new face as he needs personal security the state has no desire to ever allow freddie to be put in the position where he has to explain himself
4744618 you have to remember that he will never have a normal life the state does owe him this protection as he acted on behalf of the state and under the direction of the military for 25 years as a public executioner
4744619 the british state will not allow him to be interviewed by anyone as it would implicate the state can you imagine the financial consequences of up to 40 widows suing the state its never going to be allowed to happen

4744668 i cant understand people just standing and watching someone be assaulted without stepping in
4744669 apparently the cops threatened to tase anyone who tried to intervene
4744670 the only issue is whether the cops told the guy that if he didnt get the fuck out of the libary he was going to get his ass tazed my guess is that they did tell him
4744671 i realize when looking at these kind of arrest tapes that they dont always show the full picture but that six minutes that we can watch just seems like its a ridiculous amount of force for someone being escorted because they forgot their bruincard

4744679 after only twelve hours of deliberation the federal jury returned a unanimous verdict finding that humboldt county sheriffs used excessive force when they swabbed pepper spray into the eyes of forest activists the jurors found that former sheriff dennis lewis and current sheriff gary philp approved illegal use of force on passive protestors the jury also held the city and county liable for its officers unconstitutional actions

4744709 american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
4744710 replacing md 80s with 737s at current fuel prices provides financial benefits while enhancing the customer experience
4744711 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
4744712 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying
4744713 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air

4744717 scientists have been working on the possibilities for decades nanotechnology today is an emerging set of tools techniques and unique applications involving the structure and composition of materials on a nanoscale that is billionths of a metre
4744718 experiments with bulk materials normally yield empirical data that support the principles of physics and electrical engineering nanomaterials do not always do this
4744719 the same amount of information that fits on a current 80 gigabyte hard drive will be able to fit in a space that is too small to see with the naked eye
4744720 imaging and measurement resolutions as well as atomic structural ambiguities defects obscured the results of most experiments and provided unreliable mechanical predictions
4744721 we can be certain of all the quantities we have measured and the results match quantum mechanics predictions very well
4744722 irradiating a multiwalled carbon nanotube with an intense electron beam actually forms bonds among the shells of the tube this is like combining multiple nanotubes into one to form a stronger structure
4744723 the same procedure used to strengthen individual multiwalled nanotubes by irradiation may also be used to link together individual nanotubes into a bundle
4744724 our whole industry lives off the fact that we can put more and more on smaller and smaller space make it cheaper and also very important less power consuming in the future

4744729 yes there are political dynamics we are working to sort them out
4744730 the government will assume a supporting role and let non government organizations spearhead the discussions for the problematic concerns we want to end the conflict that clearly claimed more than 120 000 lives

4744736 but this back up plan is hardly being considered right now
4744737 it was there from the first lap the first turn
4744738 we tried some things during practice that didnt work at all
4744739 so we went back to where we were and i think thats one of the best qualifying cars ive ever had it was a heck of a lap
4744740 im very proud of everybody at red bull racing and toyota
4744741 we picked up speed from practice but i just knew in the car it wasnt the fastest lap
4744742 and i think for that red bull team and brian this has been a track that fits their style hell be ever more of a threat come race time
4744743 its the team to beat in our sport for the last several years
4744744 to lay that lap down in practice and back it up in qualifying thats a really good feeling
4744745 really unbelievable i wish we could take that and apply it to every week but its not that easy
4744746 but anytime you can see progress feel progress patience comes easier
4744747 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4744748 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4744749 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4744750 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4744751 they will be laying the foundations for technologies that will enable an inside view of cancer cell functions as opposed to the limited blackbox input output techniques currently used
4744752 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4744753 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4744754 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4744755 i used to use laundry detergent but it didnt take the manure off them like dawn does
4744756 you get four or five in there and you got to leave its so annoying and loud
4744757 you are most innocent and smart looking person and with good height
4744758 did he stopped you on road then why are you thinking of him
4744759 i am playing with her like anything yar i am always keep teasing her by calling 420
4744760 he used to teas her due to you only juvaj lost subject juvaj is good person so xxxxx named her 420 etc
4744761 he is having full touches with her now a day
4744762 juvaj once you asked her for a movie and she laughed and left away right
4744763 why should i come with you get lost you are a 420
4744764 any one is better than me for her and just went back to job search
4744765 i scolded her for 1 hr juvaj failed due to you
4744766 did you told her i me got zero even though i have written good
4744767 you can become bad for things you want thats not good
4744768 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4744769 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4744770 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4744771 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4744772 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4744773 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4744774 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4744775 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4744776 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4744777 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4744778 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4744779 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4744780 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4744781 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4744782 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4744783 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4744784 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4744785 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4744786 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4744787 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4744788 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4744789 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4744790 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4744791 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4744792 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4744793 where do you want to be financially the next two years
4744794 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4744795 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4744796 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4744797 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4744798 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4744799 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4744800 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4744801 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4744802 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4744803 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4744804 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4744805 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4744806 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4744807 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4744808 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4744809 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4744810 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4744811 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4744812 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4744813 who are open to doing something on the production side
4744814 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4744815 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4744816 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4744817 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4744818 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4744819 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4744820 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4744821 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4744822 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4744823 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4744824 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4744825 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4744826 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4744827 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4744828 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4744829 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4744830 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4744831 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4744832 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4744833 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4744834 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4744835 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4744836 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4744837 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4744838 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4744839 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4744840 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4744841 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4744842 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4744843 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4744844 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4744845 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4744846 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4744847 they did not kill or crucify him but it was made to seem so to them

4744860 i think chinese rowing has made rapid progress in recent years but we are lagging behind in terms of experience
4744861 we hope our team mates can outperform us in the races ahead and well aim for the gold in the next games
4744862 it was not bad after missing two games simply taking part in these ones has realised my dream
4744863 we didnt get a point against the top sides last season and of course wed like to improve on that just like wed like to improve our away form and our defensive record
4744864 results against the top four wont make or break our season but they would certainly help the cause we have a great game to start and it would be fantastic to get off the mark
4744865 last season we managed to have some close games against the top teams and ended up with nothing
4744866 but lets not take our eye off the ball the priority is always to try to beat the teams down and around you thats the most important thing
4744867 we finished 15th last year and obviously we want to do better get nearer the teams ahead of us
4744868 the players we have signed have proved they can handle the premier league we have seen that they are really good players and im delighted weve got them maybe we wouldnt have been able to do it last year
4744869 we lacked quality last season we came up short in areas and we are hoping that will be different this year this summer has been about buying quality not quantity
4744870 you are never happy you are always looking to improve the squad
4744871 we need three players but if it doesnt happen well get on with it we have got two weeks to play with
4744872 liverpool are a quality team they are in own league with manchester united chelsea and arsenal we look forward to the challenge and we know the fans will be up for it our motto is lets have a go
4744873 keane and torres they are not bad are they they are quality quality players what you find with the big teams is that the attacking options they have is the difference they are outstanding its the hardest position to fill
4744874 weve made great progress on an off the field you can see that with the signings weve made but im not one to look back
4744875 you are never happy you are always looking to improve the squad
4744876 we need three players but if it doesnt happen well get on with it we have got two weeks to play with
4744877 weve made great progress on an off the field you can see that with the signings weve made but im not one to look back
4744878 sunderland is where im meant to be without a shadow of doubt ive no regrets ive enjoyed every minute of it even though its been a rollercoaster
4744879 i feel a little bit of everything relief excitement everything
4744880 i had to take my goggles off to make sure the 1 was next to my name
4744881 one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport and its pretty cool thats all i can say
4744882 just to get one hit in the olympics is amazing
4744883 we have nothing to lose the chinese have the pressure
4744884 china has to win the gold medal in their own country here and we will see what happens in the final
4744885 i played him before in the german bundesliga and i won both matches but today he really played at his limit and it really was a tough match for my nerves mentally it was very tough
4744886 we werent fully confident we stayed in the game but were still not as good as them
4744887 we have to play to our best to have any kind of a chance but we felt like we played quite well today were satisfied with our performance its just a shame to lose
4744888 we didnt think wed be able to beat hong kong we were so excited
4744889 our goal was to win a medal so tomorrow we have to get back to work
4744890 when i did take that extra half stroke i thought id lost the race im really sort of lost for words
4744891 i feel a little bit of everything relief excitement everything
4744892 i was not feeling well out there i was just not having fun
4744893 i shed a few tears but i must put it behind me and move on to the points race it is a different animal
4744894 it was felt that his behavior on the medal podium and during the medal ceremony was not appropriate
4744895 his behavior was not in the olympic spirit of respect for his fellow athletes whatever grievances you may have this was not the way to go about it
4744896 the awards ceremony is a highly symbolic ritual acknowledged as such by all athletes and other participants
4744897 any disruption by any athlete in particular a medalist is in itself an insult to the other athletes and to the olympic movement it is also contrary to the spirit of fair play
4744898 it was just a little jump it was cool with me
4744899 i dont want to compare myself to either one of those great quarterbacks i want to play my game and see what i can do i have to keep my head up
4744900 i wasnt close to where i should have been rausch needs to enjoy it but he still has to work
4744901 to keep improving because our no 2 guys are going to keep forcing him its like any other position as youre competing if you fall off theres somebody else there to take your place our other quarterbacks are going to push him into greatness
4744902 he comes over the top with it he controls the nose of the football he knows where the ball is going its on that plane
4744903 hes a competitor hes got some fire hes responded when we put him in difficult situations
4744904 its not like that its straight desert its hot sometimes it gets to 120 but i was cool with that i had dirt bikes i had an off road truck i could live with it it was good
4744905 this is awesome this is winter back in palm springs
4744906 weve evaluated him a lot and it was a tough decision but he knows we believe in him
4744907 were going with him the more positive reps he can get with the guys against the no 1 defense that helps him
4744908 i was scared when i looked down but i got it done
4744909 i was trying to stop but i built up too much momentum
4744910 i surf and stuff but when it comes to jumping into a pool i get scared
4744911 they thought i could jump off like nothing i never rode a rollercoaster before every time we go to an adventure park id have to wait for my family until after they rode the roller coaster

4744925 im disappointed in the system so disappointed in the system
4744926 weve maintained it but the copper was nearing its shelf life and the wooden boards over time have been loosened
4744927 they were not terribly rotten but over 150 years or so they reached a point where we need to do some major repair work
4744928 we plan to be here a couple more centuries so we take the time to do it right
4744929 were trying to keep everything exactly as it was because of the history
4744930 you can feel the steeple move when youre up there and its blowing
4744931 ever since i started on steeples i looked at this and thought i wonder if ill ever get up there
4744932 what are the pros cons of a drum riser in this room and what exactly is the main purpose of one
4744933 oh the fetus has a heartbeat i wonder if we should keep it or not
4744934 immediately she felt hands on her waist though and she was pulled roughly backward into the lap of one of the oilmen the same she d been bantering with a few moments before with the bushy moustache i was all set to leave when they brought in this little girl who oh never mind it doesn t matter now
4744935 your sister did not get her cum make her cum terri
4744936 you are most innocent and smart looking person and with good height
4744937 did he stopped you on road then why are you thinking of him
4744938 i am playing with her like anything yar i am always keep teasing her by calling 420
4744939 he used to teas her due to you only juvaj lost subject juvaj is good person so xxxxx named her 420 etc
4744940 he is having full touches with her now a day
4744941 juvaj once you asked her for a movie and she laughed and left away right
4744942 why should i come with you get lost you are a 420
4744943 any one is better than me for her and just went back to job search
4744944 i scolded her for 1 hr juvaj failed due to you
4744945 did you told her i me got zero even though i have written good
4744946 you can become bad for things you want thats not good
4744947 they did not kill or crucify him but it was made to seem so to them
4744948 every season is a season when we have to win something
4744949 if i went into a season and thought if we dont win anything they will all leave then it is all over
4744950 had we got 70 points last season and won the carling cup people would not have said it is satisfying
4744951 for me the important thing at a big club is to fight for the championship and the champions league
4744952 if there was a player for 30 million and it meant we would win the title i would do it
4744953 we already have the quality we have gone with a different policy to other clubs and thats why im convinced we have opted for stability with young players
4744954 just listen to the music and watch where you flick that tango heel
4744955 it kind of just snowballed on him in the fifth inning
4744956 he got to two outs and was one pitch away and then blum hits a three run homer
4744957 ive done that and now its time to get ray in rickies playing great but ray is going to play i have to find ways to play craig counsell gabe kapler russell branyan you cant let those guys go stagnant while you wear the other guys out
4744958 relievers are valuable to pick up a pitcher wed have to release a pitcher im not saying we wont do a deal but you have to be a little guarded
4744959 what kind of fucktard tries to hit and run with the pitcher at bat
4744960 my only instinct or reaction after the game was wow
4744961 it was so much fun being in a game in the end of july with that much intensity that much action that much excitement and electricity its so good for our players to go through something like this in the end of july and get a sense of what its like to play deep deep into the season
4744962 weve faced two all star pitchers in the last two days
4744963 you can talk about it all you want with runners in scoring position those are good pitchers those are very very good pitchers and that stuff happens when you face all star pitchers
4744964 johnl his name is larussa managing a team that is not a talented as the brewers or cubs and they are now tied again for the wild card spot with your ned yost managed brewers
4744965 i hate to say it but i think thats the season at least well have a new manager next year one who doesnt screw up two starting pitchers by platooning them i mean yost cant last another year if we miss the playoffs can he
4744966 about the only thing worse than that would be losing the rest of their games
4744967 my thinking was that i wanted to take corey out for a day or two
4744968 coreys just really struggling right now im going to give him more than a day
4744969 i just told him he said fine but what can he say he said ok he understands
4744970 its a bit of timing but hes just swinging at everything they throw up there
4744971 hes come off his approach a little bit i dont think hes pressing though i dont see that from him
4744972 he was pitching fine and it went to hell on him i guess the heat and humidity took its toll
4744973 im so glad brett favres back to lead the packers to the super bowl this year
4744974 non hustle being late disrespecting the game in terms of hot dogging no hustling those types of things
4744975 all the doom and gloom that was in here two days ago
4744976 and we end up with a 4 2 road trip weve got good talented players and were playing good baseball
4744977 why cameron and harts age is relevant to you is beyond me my point is why criticize the production of one when statistical evidence shows hes roughly equal and in fact outperforming the other in run production which is about 50 billion times more important than strikeout percentage winners of baseball games are determined by which teams score more runs not which team strikes out least
4744978 hell do at least one special thing in the playoffs to win a game or two
4744979 but as long as ned yost managing id be surprised if we will make the wild card
4744980 i kind of bullied him into it at the start he wasnt that into it he wanted something low key
4744981 we were up in the air when a few guys who were a lot older than us started to fight
4744982 we redirected to venice for a couple of hours and the police had to come on and get them off
4744983 they had been talking to the guards in dublin airport because i think one of them had lost their boarding pass before they left they had a couple of drinks on them they werent very bad they were just extremely aggressive
4744984 i think as soon as they sat down there were problems one of the guys half way through the flight stood up and started smashing the overhead compartment with his hands i think some people felt a little bit threatened
4744985 i think the police were actually finding it a bit difficult to realise who was fighting and who wasnt
4744986 the game against us was tight and they kept their nerve and used their experience to win they looked very very strong against wexford in the leinster final and looked to be huge favourites for the all ireland after that
4744987 i think dublin have the edge over tyrone at the moment but in saying that tyrone have players who have won all ireland medals and know what its about
4744988 dublin will win the all ireland because they have the hunger and they have the experience now
4744989 they have players like shane ryan and ciaran whelan and alan brogan who are in great form bryan cullen didnt have the best of years last season but this year he has really stepped up to the mark
4744990 i just think its going to be dublins year the players are there long enough to know how to win tight games
4744991 if it was 15 against 15 it could have gone either way
4744992 brian dooher showed his class and experience that day his experience will be needed for tyrone to have any chance the last day against mayo he wasnt as good but he is still a top quality player
4744993 if they are to beat dublin they will need to do it for 70 minutes instead of great spells for 10 minutes they really have to step up to the plate
4744994 a childs experience of and attitude towards school is bound to be affected by the conditions
4744995 we are all sensitive to the environment we work in
4744996 its shocking that so many children are subjected to this im amazed at how teachers and pupils cope
4744997 i know it is becoming extremely upsetting for parents and teachers who have to deal with this every year
4744998 there is constant disappointment i couldnt even describe the disappointment
4744999 oponerse a la y vasca significa oponerse al progreso de la ciudadan a vasca y pone adem s en evidencia las contradicciones en las que se ha movido tambi n el gobierno vasco que hasta hace escasas semanas segu a poniendo en duda la autor a de eta en los atentados de la y vasca
4745000 de las consecuencias de simplemente buscar r ditos electorales con algunas declaraciones
4745001 vuelve a manifestar lo que siempre ha querido hacer amedrentar a la sociedad vasca atemorizar a la poblaci n en este caso personaliz ndolo con el partido socialista
4745002 a nadie de la uni n europea se le ocurre poner bombas por estar en contra de un proyecto
4745003 es obvio que este grup sculo de gente todav a no tiene la madurez democr tica suficiente para reconocer que a veces se gana y otras se pierde
4745004 dicen que la consulta desvirt a el derecho a decidir y son ellos quienes no respetan la voluntad del pueblo
4745005 si respetaran m nimamente la voluntad de este pueblo hace a os que habr an desaparecido
4745006 debe basarse en los argumentos del di logo y el consenso y nunca en la amenaza y la extorsi n
4745007 eta aspira a poder presentarse ante la sociedad vasca como un agente pol tico pero quien amenaza coacciona y asesina s lo merece el desprecio de la ciudadan a
4745008 todo tipo de violencia y en especial contra la mujer

4745017 i can see by the language he uses why people think he could be the antichrist
4745018 but from my reading of scripture he doesnt meet the criteria there is no indication in the bible that the antichrist will be an american
4745019 nicolae carpathia a charming romanian politician who later reveals to be sic the long predicted
4745020 if obama really is the antichrist shouldnt we vote for him
4745021 and it got even more frightening when you saw the others
4745022 the unique thing about this cast is that it has dermal ridges and the flow and texture matches the ridge flow texture of one from california
4745023 the ridges are about twice as thick as in a human being
4745024 thats what makes it unique the only other animal ive seen this in is a howler monkey in costa rica
4745025 not the missing link its not an extra terrestrial its just an animal a flesh and blood primate that has learned to be elusive around man and avoids man where possible
4745026 i do know however that as recently as last week i think it was the senator made a comment in south dakota regarding his wife entering some buffalo chips contest which is this topless deal and if she were to enter she would probably win it and my personal opinion and based on my understanding of the christian faith thats not not n o t not the type of expression that a presidential candidate or anyone for that matter who is a follower of the christian faith ought to make
4745027 abc has a mccain aide saying the candidate did know about the nature of the contest but was merely joking
4745028 absolutely i would because if you cant keep your faith to your most sacred vow til death do us part how in the world can i trust you to lead my family my government my nation
4745029 know that john mccains faith and character were tested and forged in ways few can fathom

4745041 there is no reason for any of the rights privileges benefits of any group on gender sex or any other basis to be different from any other i am for the kind of result that occurred in connecticut and several other states to make sure that civil unions with all of the benefits are exactly the same
4745042 look i have been married for 32 years i dont see gay marriage as a threat to my marriage now i do understand that people have problems with it and that there are people like jim and mike who want to go the civil union route and i dont want to see division especially the right throwing division in this for no reason what i think is a more important issue is employment is enda thirty three states say it is legal to fire someone for being gay and i think thats a bigger issue
4745043 but eric and cathy im surprised at the question because i just dont think thats whats foremost in minnesotans minds this is an issue used by republicans to divide democrats and divide the country minnesotans want to hear about iraq about infrastructure about issues they face in their everydays lives
4745044 i fully support gay marriage however i do not support and fear the idea that gay lesbian couples would file discrimination suits against churches who wont conduct a marriage ceremony for them
4745045 the democrats are telling our ministers that they have to marry fags next thing theyll be insisting that we marry men and sheep

4745056 at the start of last season i was asked if ronaldo could score more than 25 goals and i replied i was looking for improvement
4745057 improvement can come in different ways for ronaldo this season 42 goals is a target it is still possible for him to achieve that given the talent of the boy and his goalscoring ability but you have to say it is a big target
4745058 the idea is to put on the field to play our game in a way that is as similar as brazilian football as we can but i have players who are made for english football their characteristics are different
4745059 we will try to learn about dribbling controlling the ball passing the ball touching the ball and one twos but i need to respect the identity of the players and the quality of the players we have some players who play similar to those in brazil but others dont
4745060 but they need to understand that sometimes it is difficult to play beautifully and win sometimes it is impossible because the other team plays a different style

4745247 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
4745248 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
4745249 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury

4745255 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
4745256 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
4745257 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
4745258 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
4745259 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
4745260 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
4745261 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
4745262 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
4745263 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
4745264 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life

4745275 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
4745276 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
4745277 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
4745278 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
4745279 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
4745280 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
4745281 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
4745282 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
4745283 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
4745284 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
4745285 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
4745286 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
4745287 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
4745288 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
4745289 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot

4745297 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4745298 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4745299 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4745300 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4745301 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

4745305 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4745306 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4745307 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4745308 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4745309 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4745310 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4745311 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4745312 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4745313 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4745314 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4745315 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4745316 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4745317 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4745318 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4745319 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4745320 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4745321 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4745322 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4745323 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4745324 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4745325 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4745326 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4745327 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4745328 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4745329 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4745330 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4745331 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4745332 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4745333 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4745334 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4745335 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4745336 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4745337 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4745338 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4745339 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4745340 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4745341 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4745342 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4745343 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4745344 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4745345 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4745346 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4745347 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4745348 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4745349 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4745350 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4745351 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4745352 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4745353 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4745354 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4745355 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4745356 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4745357 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4745358 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4745359 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4745360 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

4745383 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4745384 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4745385 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4745386 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4745387 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4745388 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4745389 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4745390 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4745391 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4745392 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4745393 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4745394 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
4745395 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4745396 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4745397 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4745398 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4745399 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
4745400 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
4745401 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
4745402 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
4745403 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4745404 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
4745405 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4745406 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4745407 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4745408 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4745409 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4745410 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
4745411 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4745412 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4745413 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
4745414 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
4745415 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4745416 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4745417 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

4745419 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
4745420 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
4745421 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
4745422 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
4745423 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar

4745425 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
4745426 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4745427 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4745428 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4745429 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4745430 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4745431 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4745432 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4745433 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4745434 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

4745438 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4745439 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4745440 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

4745456 zionism creates anti semitism and we know zionism is the root cause for the pain suffering and bloodshed of the jewish people and they the zionists are the greatest factory of anti semitism worldwide judaism and zionism is not one and the same they are diametrically opposite we should not be mistaken one for the other and we shouldnt be responsible for the actions of what the zionists do now another of the problems that emanate actually from the zionist movement is the fact that they are encroaching upon the rights of the palestinian people the indigenous people who are living there and this is terribly wrong it is against every concept of the torah so whatever they are doing is totally wrong

4745524 and it came to pass in process of time that the king of egypt died and the children of israel sighed by reason of the bondage and they cried and their cry came up unto god by reason of the bondage
4745525 and god heard their groaning and god remembered his covenant with abraham with isaac and with jacob
4745526 now therefore behold the cry of the children of israel is come unto me and i have also seen the oppression wherewith the egyptians oppress them come now therefore and i will send thee unto pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of israel out of egypt
4745527 i am the lord thy god which have brought thee out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondage
4745528 and if thy brother an hebrew man or an hebrew woman be sold unto thee and serve thee six years then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee and when thou sendest him out free from thee thou shalt not let him go away empty thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock and out of thy floor and out of thy winepress of that wherewith the lord thy god hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of egypt and the lord thy god redeemed thee therefore i command thee this thing to day
4745529 thou shalt neither vex a stranger nor oppress him for ye were strangers in the land of egypt
4745530 and remember that thou wast a servant in the land of egypt and that the lord thy god brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm therefore the lord thy god commanded thee to keep the sabbath day
4745531 and ye shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and ye shall return every man unto his possession and ye shall return every man unto his family
4745532 therefore thus saith the lord ye have not hearkened unto me in proclaiming liberty every one to his brother and every man to his neighbour behold i proclaim a liberty for you saith the lord to the sword to the pestilence and to the famine and i will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth
4745533 wherefore have we fasted say they and thou seest not wherefore have we afflicted our soul and thou takest no knowledge behold in the day of your fast ye find pleasure and exact all your labours behold ye fast for strife and debate and to smite with the fist of wickedness ye shall not fast as ye do this day to make your voice to be heard on high
4745534 is not this the fast that i have chosen to loose the bands of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens and to let the oppressed go free and that ye break every yoke is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house when thou seest the naked that thou cover him and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh
4745535 the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised
4745536 jesus answered them verily verily i say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin
4745537 and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name jesus for he shall save his people from their sins
4745538 then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death
4745539 what shall we say then is the law sin god forbid nay i had not known sin but by the law for i had not known lust except the law had said thou shalt not covet
4745540 thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself i am the lord
4745541 therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them for this is the law and the prophets
4745542 neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved
4745543 if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed
4745544 and if any man hear my words and believe not
4745545 but jesus called them to him and saith unto them ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the gentiles exercise lordship over them and their great ones exercise authority upon them but so shall it not be among you but whosoever will be great among you shall be your minister and whosoever of you will be the chiefest shall be servant of all for even the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many
4745546 now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty
4745547 but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth
4745548 when we conceded the one goal we all just looked at each other and just regained our composure and stood tall and pushed forward
4745549 then we went back on the attack and executed some really nice penalty corners
4745550 the skipper barber put the hand up thank goodness and made the save thats as good as knocking another one in at the other end i was very proud of the way they defended that final corner
4745551 i deserve the medal because ive trained for 14 years
4745552 i give thanks to the support of my nation my people and my family
4745553 in the final round you saw a very exciting game and it was an honor to be participating
4745554 it gave us the opportunity to show that archery can be a very exciting sport
4745555 i shot good he shot better the olympic games are about the extraordinary
4745556 it hadnt been my best season but i saved my best performance for the games
4745557 polisen fick jobba h rt under fredagen fyllor slagsm l och st ld tillh r de obehagligheter som intr ffade under festen
4745558 lo que nunca querr a es que le quitaran la medalla para d rmela a m porque es un compa ero y un amigo adem s no creo que haya ninguna raz n y si hubiera tenido algo antirreglamentario no le hubieran dejado salir en pek n es un problema que ni me planteo
4745559 yes yes whatever i was talking about but you would be just as happy living all your life long without a husband lover partner if that were the way it turned out wouldnt you
4745560 im not scared my goal is to better my personal best
4745561 in the heats there are people with a lot of experience
4745562 aplican recargos innecesarios en los precios de los billetes de ryanair que en ocasiones llegan al 200 de incremento
4745563 no informar a los usuarios de los t rminos y condiciones de ryanair tampoco les informan de la situaci n actualizada o cambios en los vuelos y retrasan el funcionamiento de la web con conexiones masivas
4745564 seg n la normativa vigente es la compa a a rea la que est obligada a informar al cliente de las modificaciones o cancelaciones
4745565 las agencias on line siempre facilitan a las compa as a reas los datos de contacto de los clientes y las condiciones y t rminos de vuelo
4745566 en ning n momento se establece una relaci n contractual entre las agencias y ryanair
4745567 la ley faculta a las agencias la intermediaci n en reservas de servicios tur sticos
4745568 se ajustan a lo que marca la ley en espa a por el concepto gastos de gesti n al ofrecer la informaci n de todas las ofertas del mercado
4745569 detr s de estas declaraciones ryanair intenta ocultar a la opini n p blica y a sus inversores su supuestamente delicada situaci n econ mica
4745570 cancelar un importante n mero de reservas realizadas y pagadas directamente por el viajero a ryanair habiendo sido utilizados voluntariamente los servicios de mediaci n de las agencias de viajes
4745571 corresponder a mayoritariamente a reservas realizadas con mucha antelaci n y bajo precio para ponerlas nuevamente a la venta a precio actual que estar a muy por encima del precio pagado inicialmente
4745572 est en juego la libertad de los consumidores de poder disponer de toda la informaci n antes de tomar su decisi n de compra
4745573 va a defender este derecho y est estudiando las acciones legales que puedan adoptarse para la mejor defensa de los intereses de los consumidores
4745574 incompresiblemente esta aerol nea que dice tener los mejores precios del mercado parece no desear que los consumidores puedan a trav s de la agencias comparar su oferta con la de otras compa as
4745575 nuestra pr ctica es absolutamente transparente y l cita y redunda en beneficio del consumidor creemos que ryanair persigue crear una clima de desconfianza hacia los portales online para intentar canalizar la venta de sus billetes de avi n a trav s de su propia p gina web evitando as la comparaci n de precios y discrimin ndonos simplemente por ser agencias online
4745576 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4745577 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4745578 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4745579 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4745580 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4745581 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4745582 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4745583 our soccer team won the gold medal in martial arts
4745584 china has had a weird year with a freak snowstorm the tibetan riots and an earthquake but the performance of our soccer team shows that some things never change
4745585 our strikers did such a great job that i even told them they should start playing for our mens team now
4745586 its so beyond an embarrassment that it almost seems like a comedy
4745587 weve cried our tears dry and now its time for us to enjoy the big show because you never know how our team is going to lose this time
4745588 i have tickets to some of the womens matches too i wouldnt come this far just to watch the mens team
4745589 trois autres civils sont morts lh pital lun dentre eux serait le chauffeur de lun des bus ses proches ne se sont pas encore pr sent s lh pital
4745590 nous avons retrouv s quatre corps ce matin un endroit et deux autres ailleurs pr s de tredishe ce sont des civils qui ont t tu s hier vendredi apr s midi par les forces thiopiennes
4745591 les six personnes ont t tu es par les ethiopiens hier et nous navons pu les enterrer que ce matin lorsquils les ethiopiens ont quitt la zone nous sommes en train de les enterrer
4745592 they were able to remove the torn piece and clean out some debris as well lamont is in good spirits he will undergo a 12 week rehab regimen and we fully expect him to be ready to go for the fall workouts
4745593 he has the capability of playing a number of positions for us and at 6 5 he can score at any of the perimeter positions hes a great fit with the chemistry and make up of our team and we look forward to having him for the next two years
4745594 i would definitely say charlotte is the front runner now
4745595 im confident that bobby will continue to build a program that all people in the charlotte region can come to call their own bobby is all in and so are we
4745596 itd be brutal itd be awful thats why he has guests
4745597 he will never have the opportunity to lay eyes on his children again
4745598 he sat on the mountain for four days without food and water when all of a sudden an angel appeared and took him to the red star planet where the angels taught him how to treat his father
4745599 the prosecutor racicot told the jury to ignore it all because police had contaminated the crime scene
4745600 only the person who committed this crime could know the details spelled out in that confession
4745601 jenna is really very good in this movie and i think that acting comedy and sex come together quite naturally for her
4745602 attack no 1 a beautiful song i know you will love her music video so you better check it out now
4745603 we have no quota for filipinos even one million are welcome
4745604 the uniqueness of our program is that we not only embrace eastern and western philosophies but we try to integrate the traditions of new mexico
4745605 keeping the body in balance staying healthy exercising eating healthy and doing good things in your life
4745606 to achieve one goal of health and wellness in our patients
4745607 thats different from a place where you can sense healing right from the beginning
4745608 the uniqueness of our program is that we not only embrace eastern and western philosophies but we try to integrate the traditions of new mexico
4745609 keeping the body in balance staying healthy exercising eating healthy and doing good things in your life
4745610 to achieve one goal of health and wellness in our patients
4745611 thats different from a place where you can sense healing right from the beginning
4745612 its here because our consumers are wanting it our consumers are asking these questions so we have to go out and find the answers for them
4745613 when i did that chop on the last stroke i thought it cost me the race
4745614 but it was actually the opposite if i had have glided i would have been way too long i ended up making the right decision
4745615 one hundredth is the smallest of margins of victory in sport its pretty cool thats all i can say
4745616 the financial market turmoil has meant that our funds rate reductions have led to less credit expansion to households and businesses than would typically be the case
4745617 the second half of 2008 will likely be extremely sluggish
4745618 well see some alleviation of the inflation pressures and having oil and other commodities come down so strongly helps
4745619 we run the risk of persistent widespread price increases being built into the expectations of households and businesses and those producing persistently higher bases for both inflation measures
4745620 he loved black music r amp b music and rhythm and blues was his foundation he had a feeling for it
4745621 among my favorite sessions i feel the things we did together were dynamite
4745622 he estado muy cerca pero me ha faltado un punto m s
4745623 sobrado no he estado pero a n tengo un cartuchito
4745624 nadal o djokovic es dif cil ojal que sea un partido tan largo como ste
4745625 he estado muy cerca pero me ha faltado un punto m s
4745626 sobrado no he estado pero a n tengo un cartuchito
4745627 nadal o djokovic es dif cil ojal que sea un partido tan largo como ste
4745628 my own view is that now is not the time to renew or refurbish city chambers furniture
4745629 in the last few months school budgets have been cut nursery school hot meals have been abandoned numerous voluntary organisations have seen funding reduced and community centres are losing full time workers
4745630 when front line services in edinburgh are being cut across the board this seems at the very least to be ill judged timing
4745631 this historic furniture is a civic asset different people put a different price on preserving our heritage but this administration considers that we should take advantage of this opportunity not only to preserve it but to see it in practical use within the city chambers
4745632 to do otherwise would mean selling the chairs or allowing them to decay and neither would be the right decision for the city
4745633 the desks and chairs belong to the city not the council
4745634 stephen worked very hard on the course and i had no doubts that he wouldve been successful in a career as a photographer he had his own way of looking at the world and that wouldve served him well
4745635 stephen wanted to be a photo journalist and he had the talent for it he was already doing well at getting work experience on different papers
4745636 he made a lot of sacrifices to be on the course and never had much money
4745637 it was things like that which made him stand out as a real character
4745638 i knew stephen for three years and i cant believe this has happened i was just in paris with him in june on a college trip and we were part of a group of friends who hung around together a lot
4745639 stephen was right into his music and clubbing but he was passionate about photography and very ambitious hed always be telling you about what he was going to do in the future
4745640 he was really the life and soul of the party who could talk your ears off he was bright and bubbly full of ideas and enthusiasm
4745641 he was such a nice guy and always willing to help you out on a photography shoot he helped me a number of times
4745642 he was doing well with the press stuff but he also liked to take quite quirky abstract shots as well
4745643 in isolation the tram link is likely to have limited impact on the attractiveness of west edinburgh as a location choice
4745644 at best it may increase the attractiveness of edinburgh compared to other third tier cities for investors but is unlikely to propel it into first tier location status
4745645 outside of the city centre an efficient transport system is vital in making a successful business location
4745646 for most professional services companies 85 per cent of costs will be staff related
4745647 providing a range of transport choices for workers will improve staff wellbeing lower churn rates reduce costs and ultimately increase profitability
4745648 coupled with the quality of buildings and the strategic position people based businesses could enjoy a competitive advantage in west edinburgh
4745649 you very rarely get a definite answer for why firms choose manchester dublin or elsewhere instead of edinburgh it is a combination of factors but one of the main ones will be transport
4745650 the trams will significantly improve the perception of the city and improve links to the waterfront area and leith but they will not make a significant difference to our job in the city of attracting new firms
4745651 many major financial companies already have global headquarters in edinburgh and the number is growing and many have spoken in support of the trams scheme
4745652 it will serve existing businesses along the route and provide a much needed link between the airport the west of the city and the rest of the capital
4745653 they told her to take her washing in as they were claiming the back garden she was understandably very upset and was in tears
4745654 we couldnt believe they could take it away weve been looking after the garden for nearly 20 years now the builder has put a fence up through our garden
4745655 as far as we knew the garden had always been part of the house it was only when we thought of building an extension that we looked at the title deeds and found it actually belonged to the property next door
4745656 when it came up for sale we offered to buy it but were refused we thought it was the right thing to do but i wish we hadnt said anything now
4745657 ashfords property deeds clearly show the boundary limits and there has never been any evidence or suggestion from any party that these are not correct
4745658 since taking ownership of the land ashford has extended considerable goodwill to mr muir whose guesthouse clients have used the access from lady road as an overspill car park
4745659 it was a great journey we met some lovely people and visited some fab places but nothing beats home needless to say we are looking forward to a warm shower some good grub and our own beds
4745660 hes ashamed of his behaviour and very much regrets it
4745661 we take the strongest exception to this it is absolutely wrong
4745662 this is extremely offensive to the thousands of men and women who have served under the union flag
4745663 the image is merely a visitscotland montage used to promote homecoming 2009 adding fireworks and a saltire to the castle since the saltire is the badge of homecoming
4745664 these are just promotional images not adverts for the castle and they have no political or any other significance whatsoever
4745665 we want to help parents and kids to enjoy something of the festival without costing them a fortune its just our way of giving a small gift to our neighbours
4745666 i am a regeneration practitioner and enjoy working in teams of people of diverse skills and personalities
4745667 what i am doing is nothing new as churches have had a presence of building communities for hundreds of years
4745668 you dont expect it on your doorstep but thats life it could happen anywhere
4745669 they were a law abiding family theyve never been in trouble whatsoever theyre normal everyday lads
4745670 the signal crayfish is one of the most problematic invasive species introduced to these shores
4745671 as well as competing with valuable native fish the holes they bore into river banks for their nests can leave the land weak and lead to a greater risk of flooding
4745672 the staffing budget for 2008 09 is 77 2m and represents 40 per cent of the gross budget
4745673 controls were put in place in 2007 08 and are continuing in the coming year
4745674 when i received these messages i sent one back saying that i was no longer a victim and i wouldnt be frightened into keeping quiet
4745675 i wanted to speak out first to get justice but also so other victims dont feel so alone im not going to change that and be intimidated because anyone feels ashamed by what some members of my family did
4745676 these people are attacking dana because she spoke out about the paedophile ring they are trying to intimidate her into silence but that wont work
4745677 dana has just recovered from an illness which couldve killed her so she doesnt need the stress but shes not going to be afraid of these death threats
4745678 we applied for the extension until 11pm but we are delighted with the 10pm licence our customers will appreciate the extra hour
4745679 i know there will be some opposition but i think it will work we have got a new night time team in to monitor this i think we have got to try it and see how well it works
4745680 the police did raise concerns but it was a comment not an objection they were very clear on that
4745681 i believe that 9pm is an appropriate time for the permission to cease as this will permit the clearance of the public footways of table and chairs to permit free passage of those patrons attending the late night entertainment venues around the city
4745682 we were trying to help people out to give smokers somewhere to go with the smoking ban and trying to promote edinburghs cafe culture
4745683 as far as im aware the council seems happy to grant a licence until 10pm but not as late as 11pm im in agreement with that
4745684 real time information systems are among the most immediately and obviously useful innovations in transport information provision
4745685 by providing constant updates on arrival times for bus services they put the travelling public back in control of their journeys
4745686 the passengers know how long the wait will be whether they have time to go and buy the newspaper or make that telephone call whether they are running late or in time for appointments like most good ideas its simple but extremely useful
4745687 it may prove to be particularly useful in rural areas where bus services are less frequent and miscalculating a bus arrival time could lead to a long inconvenient wait
4745688 sestran aims to ensure that the same quality of real time travel information is available to travellers across the partnership area
4745689 the bustracker system in edinburgh city has been highly successful and is hugely popular with the travelling public
4745690 real time information helps to encourage more people to travel by public transport so we warmly welcome the fact that east and midlothian councils are introducing more signs in their areas this is excellent news for bus passengers
4745691 we are very concerned that the important information and recommendations in the report should not be buried
4745692 we very much hope that the report will be officially published by lothian health as soon as possible and will be widely distributed to health and social care professionals as promised
4745693 we are entirely relaxed about edmesh placing the draft report on its website indeed we will be putting it on our own website and we are already in the process of arranging this to take place within the next few days unfortunately any delays have been due primarily to changes in personnel
4745694 we are planning to undertake a comprehensive review of me services in lothian and we welcome this report which we believe will be informative and will form part of that review
4745695 we were quite nervous beforehand we got a loan of a giant tv screen had the room blacked out and had it all set up like a sports bar but we were very good we didnt pop any corks until after the final
4745696 the good thing about it is being a sprint its all over quite quickly but it seems a lot longer at the time
4745697 we just went wild when they won it was just fantastic we could see his mum dad sister and sarra his girlfriend jumping up in beijing with their flags just like we were so it was just like being there its superb
4745698 to beat them by half a second made it that exciting honestly it took every inch of effort in beating the french who have been invincible
4745699 theres still plenty in the tank if i get three golds ill do a dance for you and thats a promise
4745700 theyre up on cloud nine it was such a fantastic result for him on the first day
4745701 weve got another four days of this i dont think i can stand it
4745702 he was always very quick and very determined even when he was just a wee boy on his bmx he was terrifically competitive right from the start
4745703 chris hoys magnificent achievement in beijing has made edinburgh proud congratulations to him and his team on their olympic triumph
4745704 that he was also going to sign the accord and that russia would scrupulously respect its commitments on this agreement
4745705 constantine had it in mind that driving thither in the dusk of the evening they might get an inkling of what was coming even though one knows that one is driving to a banquet and imagination endeavors for an instant to deal with the voluptuous thought the impression made by natural surroundings is so powerful that it must prevail that this might occur was constantines only fear for while there is no power which knows so well how to beautify all things as does imagination neither is there any power which can so profoundly disturb everything when it fails one upon coming into contact with real life
4745706 fok is een groot aanhanger van de vrijheid van meningsuiting maar in dit geval trek ik een persoonlijke grens
4745707 ik zou het buitengewoon toejuichen als iemand eventjes buitengewoon integer het woonadres van femke halsema opsnuffelt en die tent buitengewoon integer in de fik steekt dat wijf verdient niet beter
4745708 columnisten genieten een grote vrijheid en aangezien ik niet alles persoonlijk vooraf kan controleren
4745709 its just another spin on the same old thing again
4745710 its just another spin on the same old thing again
4745711 sponsoren ioc und regierung haben olympia 2008 abgesichert wie nie zuvor offiziell ist der spielraum f r trittbrettfahrer im olympia marketing sehr eng
4745712 nicht einmal ein mittelbarer bezug auf olympische motive wie stadion und sportlerfotos ist gestattet damit k nnen die beh rden schon bei vermuteter zuwiderhandlung schnell eingreifen
4745713 uns waren die regularien nicht bekannt es war eine einmalige aktion in drei deutschen zeitungen
4745714 in keinster weise mit dirk holger geschwindner nowitzkis mentor die red und dem dbb abgestimmt gewesen
4745715 the president informed participants of the security council meeting that he had just now signed the six point plan
4745716 we are firmly committed to becoming a vendor of choice in the cable industry leveraging decades of systems and manufacturing excellence and todays announcement asserts our commitment
4745717 the comcast on demand platform is the perfect environment for targeted marketable brands and programming
4745718 for example for the first time ever on pay television were going to launch the channel with all 17 films from the james bond library
4745719 were having distribution conversations at the highest level of all of the msos given the content that weve got we are highly confident that well have significant distribution at premium license fees by next fall
4745720 weve got 15 or 16 months to come up with the perfect name and were still playing around with it
4745721 has a mandatory commitment of 31 4 million increasing to 42 9 million if certain performance targets are achieved
4745722 made capital contributions to fearnet of 5 million in october 2006 2 6 million in july 2007 and 2 5 million in april 2008
4745723 as of june 30 2008 the company has a remaining commitment for additional capital contributions totaling 3 2 million which are expected to be fully funded over the next two year period
4745724 this reconfirms for us that our customers are willing to treat themselves when we provide compelling products and presentations
4745725 members of the fcc at various times have expressed an interest in obtaining the authority to regulate the content of cable television speech as well as broadcast television speech
4745726 the supreme court has already established a legal standard for indecent content on broadcast television a standard that is completely different from cable television
4745727 time warners brief is a solution desperately searching for a problem
4745728 reported examples of the bush administration considering other deceptive schemes to justify or provoke war with iraq such as the reported consideration of painting a u s aircraft with un colors in order to provoke iraq into military confrontation
4745729 the us was thinking of flying u2 reconnaissance aircraft with fighter cover over iraq painted in un colors if saddam fired on them he would be in breach
4745730 it was also possible that a defector could be brought out who would give a public presentation about saddams wmd and there was also a small possibility that saddam would be assassinated
4745731 the biggest thing is when someone says you cant do things when people say its impossible to tie or break these records i proved anythings possible
4745732 if you put in the hard work and put your mind to it anythings possible
4745733 that is a lack of respect on the part of the u s manager to say that
4745734 the cuban team is very professional we respect the game and our opponents we are incapable of doing that
4745735 your team arrested him for gulp quick shift look around the area drunk amp disorderly
4745736 good grief boss we are totally forbidden from arresting for that offence we have to use section 5 public order act because its a recordable crime and therefore we can get a detection out of it

4745738 i cant upload my pics to msn for some reason
4745739 the very day that i made the appointment to have the chemo started was the day i found out i had west nile virus
4745740 everybody was all so tickled that i had west nile virus i was even tickled because versus cancer
4745741 but i just went on i thought i wasnt gonna get west nile virus that was for other people
4745742 first of all my husband died of cancer and i didnt want to believe it
4745743 but i just went along with it i just thought they knew what they were talking about
4745744 my mom thought i was going to die we had to convince her i was fine
4745745 a lot of people at work wondered why i was working
4745746 i couldnt give blood for 190 days that upset me
4745747 lobjectif du projet est doffrir aux t l spectateurs davantage de sports que jusqu pr sent
4745748 sur le petit cran il y aura plus de football et de hockey sur glace ainsi que de nombreux autres sports
4745749 i think that it is naivete on the parts of the people doing it
4745750 i think we all need to help one another instead of hurt one another
4745751 these were their own rules their own administrators and their own hand picked panel
4745752 yet they kept the names secret this was inexcusable and should not go unpunished
4745753 now we are going to embed permanently a joint total force at scott air force base
4745754 while many bases are closing scott continues to go in the opposite direction to grow and it will continue to grow
4745755 it is my job to try to do my best and bring our taxpayer money back from washington d c to the region and this is part of that
4745756 this is something that will take that 1950s jail into the 21st century
4745757 i dont believe russia is pursuing a policy of annexation and i also dont believe that there will be a return to the previous status quo for south ossetia and abkhazia
4745758 the starting point of the military confrontation was georgias march into south ossetia we shouldnt confuse things
4745759 in my view we have seen major mistakes by the west in its policy towards russia
4745760 le pr sident a inform les participants la r union du conseil national de s curit quil venait de signer le plan en six points
4745761 ja ich bin dabei geht bis sp testens heute abend raus
4745762 heute ist freitag werter kollege wie definieren sie sp testens heute abend mein chef will die mappe heute mitnehmen damit er montag in der fr h gleich direkt fahren kann ich habe keine lust bis 20 00 uhr auf ihre agenda zu warten davon ganz abgesehen empfinde ich es als ein unding dass sie die agenda erst zwei tage vor dieser tagung verschicken
4745763 sind sie so lieb und bringen mir mal die mappe
4745764 wenn du wirklich etwas schenken willst dann schenk ein gef hl
4745765 the idea came the day of her funeral while a whole bunch of toronto sun people and whole bunch of friends and family were sitting in an irish pub
4745766 it was actually mentioned at her funeral by former sun television critic bill brioux that we should have a musical event in her honour called sherri woodstock
4745767 my no 1 priority with this is that its just a party and that were just celebrating her life there and everybody is going to have a really good time and a lot of fun
4745768 with her friends and her co workers stepping up to the plate its been like a team effort obviously under her situation and the brave journey that she took i think everybody just wants to get together and have fun
4745769 sherri has a lot of friends who are very talented musicians and weve all never actually played together before
4745770 we wanted to fill out the bill with an eclectic roster that would really represent all sides of her because anybody who knows sherri knows she had very eclectic music tastes
4745771 it has not really been that difficult at all because we all have the exact same driving force and motivation to put on something that we would all be proud of and that sherri would be proud of
4745772 i think she would just sit there and probably be looking at me saying what are you doing
4745773 im not quite as joyful a personality as she was she would be saying what have you gotten yourself into but i know that she would be loving it i see it like a little community of sherri lovers and even the people who didnt meet her will have a good time
4745774 it will definitely be the musical event of the year
4745775 stand in the ways and see and ask for the old paths where the good way is and walk in it then you will find rest for your souls but they said we will not walk in it

4745777 whats being called the russian blitz of the nation of georgia former soviet republic that split away and is now threatening to split apart from within
4745778 the powerful russian war machine is moving ever deeper into georgia and teaching all of us really a lesson about what makes russia tick
4745779 but after hundreds perhaps thousands killed and tens of thousands displaced tonight georgians are asking when will the russian bear stop
4745780 so how did this fighting start and what is it really all about
4745781 whats troubling about this war fought in a relatively unknown region is that none of the suffering here is about the enclave of ossetia this war is all about russia and the message russia is sending to the world
4745782 russia has itched to strike at southern neighbor georgias brash western oriented leader president mikheil saakashvili and saakashvili gave the kremlin an opportunity when he sent troops into the separatist region of south ossetia last week in an effort to reassert georgias sovereignty
4745783 the most urgent need is to see clearly what is taking place as the crisis deepened one could hear in washington the usual attempts to blame the victim as if georgia somehow deserved this fate because its elected government had opted for friendly relations with the west
4745784 russia as my grandmother could have told george w bush always fights dirty
4745785 russias aggression is really about the subordination of georgia a democratic market oriented u s ally
4745786 in iraq we and our iraqi allies are on the verge of a strategic victory over the jihadists
4745787 russia has sent troops and tanks across an international border
4745788 we owe georgia a serious effort to defend its sovereignty

4745790 the problem with having narrow skills like being able to structure cdos is that if you lose your job your employment prospects are limited unless you have personal connections that are willing to give you a chance at something where your skills might be distantly relevant say being the cfo of a small company most employers especially large companies want to hire someone who is already doing precisely what the job calls for ive seen enormously talented senior people and i dont mean from wall street unable to land jobs because employers write the job specifications so narrowly
4745791 if these companies get their wish you could be watching the big game your favorite movie or breaking news when your pristine digital picture freezes pixelates and the sound shuts off
4745792 an inter national coalition of athletes committed to raising awareness about and bringing an end to the crisis in darfur

4745799 vamos a enfrentar a venezuela como si fuera un equipo dif cil
4745800 como si fu ramos invencibles hasta ahora estamos jugando muy bien y esperamos seguir as lo m s importante para nosotras es llegar a la final
4745801 wir haben die ganze nacht bilder ausgewertet ich habe ihn berzeugt
4745802 er ist sehr verspielt taucht immer wieder auf und schwimmt zwischen den booten hin und her
4745803 es ist nicht auszuschlie en dass sie dahin gehen wo es viel fisch gibt
4745804 dont hey freddie me dodgely youre in hot water here kid
4745805 what happened what happened he says are you kidding me dodgely you only just pulled the stupidest stunt of your entire life do you really not remember
4745806 let me refresh you you entered marcus trents home by impersonating a police officer accused him of murdering his wife and assaulted one of his body guards
4745807 he had you arrested for trespassing and brought here he wants us to press charges for impersonating an officer of the law
4745808 wait wait wait he said i assaulted one of his body guards
4745809 listen to me dodgely what the hell were you thinking
4745810 yesterday at my office she came in wanting to hire me
4745811 i wanted to catch the guy not get hauled in for twenty questions isnt there an investigation hes got a huge insurance policy
4745812 no dodgely there is no investigation because theres no body shes an adult and missing that doesnt warrant an investigation
4745813 then it never happened im letting you out of here to go get some rest and because theres no reason for me to continue holding you im going to seriously consider bringing you up on charges and i want to give you a clear warning mr dodgely if i find out that youre sniffing around this case if i find out youre anywhere near this case im hauling you in ill hold you until your trial and then ill send you up the river im not kidding around here dodgely
4745814 sobre todo nos momentos nos que a luz da l a chea non moleste
4745815 where do you want to be financially the next two years
4745816 miamigos lieveling de eerste is het nummer une ocean de caresses
4745817 kassa nu voortaan op zondag tussen 11 en 12 uur
4745818 dit is radio caroline uitzendend vanop het radio zendschip de miamigo op 259 meter we zijn op een zandbank gelopen en we hebben dringende hulp nodig van de vaste wal
4745819 the english club have presented us with an offer but we have rejected the chance to negotiate
4745820 mallorca is not interested in the departure of these players at this moment
4745821 but the club would not be able to avoid their exits if west bromwich albion paid the money which is in the clause in their deals
4745822 ben haim has been with us only a few weeks but he has fitted in superbly
4745823 he has a point to prove after what must have been a very frustrating year for him at chelsea
4745824 but he has channelled all that into training and his performances so far he is very versatile and is a good tackler
4745825 i felt we needed to be a bit more vocal at the back and tal has already shown that he likes everyone around him to know what he thinks they should be doing
4745826 his international experience will be vital if we keep progressing in the uefa cup as well
4745827 martin is someone i have great respect for and he is shaping a good side there
4745828 but i know city have a good record at villa in recent years and i am keen to keep that going by getting us off to the best possible start
4745829 we are still working on systems and personnel and what will enable us to sustain a level of performance right from the start to the end of a premier league season
4745830 while we are looking to improve the squad if we can we already have good players here
4745831 i dont think rangers have got the money to afford mcfadden anyway to be honest i would doubt that one very much in fact ive never heard that one
4745832 if oconnor keeps playing at the level that hes at now then hell get back into the scotland squad no problem
4745833 this has come at a good time and we are excited and really believe we can win it
4745834 of course we value the super cup because it is important to win trophies because when all is said and done that is what every player wants most
4745835 we are beginning to find our level again adapting to the hard work and our new players have settled in
4745836 i think people will see a stronger team that have a new plan and a new coach with clear ideas they will be rally keen to start well
4745837 this is not master card but rather an organized scam to get your personal information use your card fraudulently or apply for fraudulent financial devices
4745838 at no time would master card contact a card holder about charges only the bank that issued the card to you would call with potential problems with the card
4745839 she was smart as a whip she told jokes she was just a classy lady
4745840 and she always had a smile youd wake her up in the morning and shed smile
4745841 my heart and thoughts and prayers go out to her family
4745842 i remember meeting her she was so vibrant and energetic and enthusiastic i just had a wonderful time and im very sorry to hear she passed away
4745843 wed always ask her mildred what are you doing today
4745844 in some cases these people lost their homes everything they owned including their memories
4745845 i am asking fema to include merrimack county and strafford county in the disaster declaration based on the concentration of damage in those communities
4745846 ill also be asking fema to reconsider extending individual assistance to the families who suffered considerable damage to their own homes
4745847 we wanted to see the ships we havent been before
4745848 it reminded me of when i was a young man in the navy and i was being escorted out of portsmouth i told them id be back
4745849 it was nice to be escorted into portsmouth and see everyone enjoying this beautiful day
4745850 it really is an exciting time for city of portsmouth the region and all of us in new hampshire as we welcome these two tall ships
4745851 the tall ships represent an important part of our history our culture and in fact our ongoing economy
4745852 i wanted to see the pirate ships because theyre cool
4745853 and ive seen pirates of the caribbean like 20 times
4745854 ive seen it before and its really a beautiful sight with the ships coming in full sail
4745855 we came last year and we loved it so we decided to come back
4745856 george hodge his book consisting of difrint ports amp ships that i have sailed in since the year 1790
4745857 empl painting quarterdeck fell from the for top mast mathew donelson and was drownded
4745858 july 19 light breeze at 5am picked up body of john carter and buried him on the isle of white
4745859 i must down to the seas again to the lonely sea and the sky and all i ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by
4745860 i fell in love with the horatio hornblower stories when i was 10 years old
4745861 this is my vacation free food free accommodations in return for sweat equity
4745862 you have to be able to work together its quite a bonding thing theres tremendous incentive to pull your own weight
4745863 i think ive been a full time legislator for at least the last two years
4745864 im no different from other state legislators most of them can handle a paying job along with their legislative duties
4745865 right now the ncsl is out in the forefront of an effort to stall u s department of health and humans services medicaid rules because it will cost states 41 billion to implement
4745866 if the ncsl is out there advocating we want them to advocate the way we want which may not be how new york or pennsylvania wants it
4745867 we took him in here and the doll goes wherever we go
4745868 the woman wanted something for her children to hug while she was in treatment where the face is you slide in a picture of the person you want to remember we put mom and dad in there
4745869 ethans been to zoos in germany and other places and he likes them
4745870 when i described it to the officer he took the time to listen he understood
4745871 i thought hed say its just a doll i cant say enough about the police there they were wonderful
4745872 tasha flew to ohio her home town we went there and picked up ethan to bring him here now shes waiting to be shipped out a year is a long time to be without a parent i hope someone returns the doll
4745873 my mommy and daddy will not be back from iraq for over a year and my doll is all i have to remind me of them if you find it could you please return it to the york police department
4745874 but also dont you think he is the father of the child
4745875 but would he be sneaking into the hotel in the middle of the night to see a child whos not his i dont think so
4745876 congressman allen is spending his time talking to mainers about his plan to strengthen the economy and has no time for spreading rumors
4745877 how the lifeguards set the flags varies depending on where the location of the breaks are which are the waves the surfers will want to play on
4745878 depending on the direction of the swells the breaks vary rather than creating conflict and putting a flag in the swim area they may narrow that swim area at their discretion
4745879 if the entire beach was a swim area it would not be reasonable the guards cant focus on the entire stretch they do observe the entire area but try to place their attention mostly on the swimming area
4745880 there always has been issues between the surfers and the swimmers
4745881 and with the recent explosion in the interest of surfing its become a problem there is a sense that more of the beach is being reserved for surfers than swimmers and some think its disproportionate
4745882 maybe on days when surfing is not optimal make a better swim area
4745883 when surfing is optimal then the swimming area would be smaller
4745884 the policy is that the lifeguards are to park on ocean boulevard if any spaces are to be had within a reasonable walking distance
4745885 if not they are allowed to park in permitted areas
4745886 we are excited about continuing to move this project forward and being part of firestone for a long time to come
4745887 when we began the process in longmont longmont was a pro business smart growth community after the election in longmont last november that direction changed when you have four people run on an anti union platform it tells you that youre not welcome
4745888 i would ask firestone voters to take into consideration that this development is so far away from their towns center and right up next to longmonts border
4745889 i would hope they think about that when they go to the voting booth
4745890 ironically if this goes forward it will affect the city of longmont more than than it will affect the town of firestone so its important for longmont
4745891 its something that has to take place before any other decisions can be made so i would say hey lets see what happens
4745892 it will probably take a couple days to better understand what this means and how it might play out
4745893 were going to be doing what we can in the time that were given
4745894 that was the toughest experience ive ever had to go through in my life going to jail and doing all of that
4745895 it really humbled me and put life into perspective i just have to learn from it and become a better man and not make those mistakes ever again
4745896 the situation that was put in the paper didnt portray exactly what happened that night i felt like i was a victim that night it was kind of unfortunate the way it happened
4745897 thats not the kind of person i am i dont go out there looking for fights
4745898 i think hes grown up a lot i think hes matured and kind of persevered hes done a great job he really has
4745899 the hardest thing for me is getting back to my fundamentals and technique and knowing all the little details about every play
4745900 but i feel like i picked up the new offense really well the new signals everything is else is going pretty good
4745901 ive had to go through a lot of stuff to get back eligible and back on the team its good to have teammates i have and the coaching staff i have they were behind me all the way and gave me a lot of support and helped me out a lot
4745902 what other guys may have on him in athleticism he makes up for in smarts
4745903 theyve been dragging their feet its been way over 60 days
4745904 its tied to very important and substantive results were trying to achieve
4745905 although we disagree with his opinions and dispute his unfounded claims mr nichols is clearly exercising his right to challenge this state permitting decision
4745906 are wildly exaggerated claims with disregard for the truth his statements are inaccurate false and apparently designed to put unfounded fear in the public
4745907 cemexs cement plant is poisoning our air endangering our children our families and a crown jewel of our national parks
4745908 the facts are that cemex lyons plant emissions including nox emissions are well below the permit limits the state of colorado set to protect the public health and environment
4745909 actually our nox emissions are less than 1 percent of the total denver area emissions most of which is generated by vehicles
4745910 after more than three years of thorough careful analysis following public comment and epa review
4745911 this is a tremendous boon for all of colorado not just brighton
4745912 by bringing more than 1 350 additional jobs here vestas is cementing its standing as one of colorados pioneering partners in the new energy economy
4745913 it was a big surprise but it was something that put another chip on my shoulder to make sure i continue to go hard day in and day out and never let down
4745914 i think it put a lot of fire under me
4745915 he gets out there on the field and when the lights go on he ended up making plays and kind of shining
4745916 once i learn the position and get a chance to fly around i use my speed to make plays in the game of football my instincts always take me to the football
4745917 playing the game of football is something that i love to do anytime i get on the field im going to try to compete and be the best at what im doing
4745918 getting a chance to go out there and fly around against some of the best guys and see what i can do it gives me a lot of confidence
4745919 my goal is to make the team and be the best player i can
4745920 the only person that can cut me is myself if i go out there and i make a lot of mistakes then its going to be easy for the coaches i just try to go out there every day and get better at what i do
4745921 thats part of the game thats part of the preseason you hope you dont have too many injuries at one position and if you do youve got to work through it
4745922 when somebodys not here or somebody goes down i step into the spot
4745923 im still playing my role and learning from jay cutler and pat and just trying to get better on a daily basis
4745924 a pernicious impact on driving up the cost of everything from medical malpractice insurance to helping cause the delay of things like life saving drugs and life saving health care equipment
4745925 i think we ought to provide a tax credit and in the case of those who have no income a refundable tax credit so that they can purchase on the open market competitive health care plans
4745926 tax credits for families who are unemployed or who are in single employee situations
4745927 that reconnect the relationship between a family or a patient and their health care provider
4745928 our county has allowed to exist a gigantic system of bureaucracies of monopolies that have disconnected that relationship between patient and provider and weve got to find ways and strategies to get that back
4745929 we need to get the federal government to back off and back out of a lot of these programs
4745930 we also need to encourage charitable organizations and churches and religious organizations to pick up the functions that they used to pick up
4745931 state and local fire mitigation crews are anxious to take advantage of this weather to burn some slash piles and do some controlled burning
4745932 i dont know whether to feel like chicken little or noah
4745933 this is my fifth year in this room and its been a problem all that time
4745934 but this is much worse usually its more localized where weve only had to evacuate a couple of desks
4745935 any time it rains or we get a heavy snow we pull out the buckets
4745936 its an indication of how the district is proceeding with repairs very much on an as needed basis
4745937 theres schools like lhs that are in dire need of some major repairs
4745938 i just wish it could be a little more watertight
4745939 with three laps to go i remember thinking im in the most dangerous position im in fourth place the targets on my back
4745940 i thought dont make any big moves but youve got to race
4745941 we think we have been responsible and we think we have been patient for a very long time if we dont get the increase we are going to have to look at making changes
4745942 our newest fire engineers are over eight years old and have over 100 000 miles on them
4745943 they take quite a bit of wear and tear and we dont have the money to replace them
4745944 it doesnt sound all that bad unless you are not breathing or not circulating blood and you are three minutes into brain damage
4745945 i come before you extremely sorry for my actions ashamed and extremely regretful
4745946 i loved my community and through my therapists recommendations i tried not to read the stories about me but it has been hard
4745947 it is not who i am and i would like to have the opportunity to prove it
4745948 the reporter is in court today who basically had my client tried and convicted before he ever had a chance to enter a plea
4745949 we have seen the sadness he has gone through the remorse he has gone through and the suffering he has gone through
4745950 he has basically been his own personal prison for the past six months
4745951 if it were me i would want to leave the country and change my identity
4745952 this has definitely been the biggest challenge to overcome i have ever faced
4745953 it is really really hard to be here today i am scared to be here
4745954 cowardly is an accurate description and the acts were ominous and creepy and they were dangerous
4745955 just a few days after i expressed doubts about our future he started his bizarre sabotage
4745956 im sure all the fans in russia will be very happy about it
4745957 i didnt sleep enough im just really happy that i could put all my energy into the match and pull out the match
4745958 the president informed participants of the security council meeting that he had just now signed the six point plan
4745959 frees the story teller to observe it is not a set of rules which fixes what he sees in the world it affects his writing primarily by guaranteeing his respect for mystery my own feeling is that writers who see by the light of their christian faith will have in these times the sharpest eyes for the grotesque for the perverse and for the unacceptable the novelist with christian concerns will find in modern life distortions which are repugnant to him and his problem will be to make these appear as distortions to an audience which is used to seeing them as natural and he may well be forced to take ever more violent means to get his vision across to this hostile audience when you can assume that your audience holds the same beliefs you do you can relax a little and use more normal means of talking to it when you have to assume that it does not then you have to make your vision apparent by shock to the hard of hearing you shout and for the almost blind you draw large and startling figures

4745965 were looking forward to coming back to dallas next summer and hopefully expanding ozzfest to a two day event
4745966 i wish we had something in writing from the usda
4745967 they said that im exempt that theres no 100 foot setback for agriculture and you can build in that setback area
4745968 how can i determine if my property contains wetlands and watercourses
4745969 what is considered a regulated activity in a wetlands or watercourse under connecticut law
4745970 a person proposing to conduct a regulated activity in or affecting a wetlands or a watercourse must first obtain a permit from an inland wetlands agency
4745971 this includes proposed farming and forestry activities to determine whether such activity is regulated or qualifies as an exempt agricultural activity
4745972 inland wetland agencies should not however require the review of ongoing farming operations such as the routine tilling of soil and planting or harvesting on croplands within wetlands or any locally established buffer zone
4745973 how can i determine if my agricultural and forestry activity is exempt under connecticut law
4745974 you do not know whether there are wetland soils on the property
4745975 i dont see any on my property that im going to be disturbing
4745976 this sluiceway is a perfect barrier to protect adjacent wetlands resources from land use change activities occurring on the property
4745977 its been months since youve done that thing to my particular body part and i want you to drive me wild
4745978 i want lingerie but first what can i do for you

4745992 hanif sekarang aku sedih banget aku tak bisa membayangkan bagaimana perasaan kakakku sudah ketiga belas kalinya dia ditolak lamarannya memang kaki kakak cacat tapi dia sosok sempurna dia itu bertanggung jawab punya kepribadian kuat dia orang berkarakter bisa menjadi seorang imam bagi keluarga untuk mencari nafkah sebagai seorang suami juga tidak kurang bahkan bisa dibilang kakak kini orang yang kaya walau kekayaan itu di bagi bagi ke anak yatim dan orang yang membutuhkan dan dia hidup dengan sederhana kakak itu jauh lebih dari sekedar cukup memang setiap kali menyampaikan lamaran aku dilarang bercerita tentang kelebihan kakak apalagi masalah kekayaan dia ingin wanita yang menjadi istrinya itu mau menerima dia secara apa adanya tidak hanya kepandaiannya keahliannya tapi semua kurang dan kelebihan yang kakak miliki diterima dengan ikhlas
4745993 vi wanita memang bermacam macam kondisi lingkungan keluarga dan masyarakat menjadi faktor dominan untuk membentuk kepribadian seseorang termasuk didalamnya seorang wanita dari situlah muncul sosok pecinta kebenaran penjunjung kesucian pembela keadilan dan kejujuran atau bisa juga menjadi sosok penipu penjilat pecundang dan penghianat keluarga bisa menjadi pemupuk pondasi atau sebaliknya bagi para calon anggota masyarakat yaitu anak anak sekarang sangat sulit untuk menemukan sosok seperti yang kakak silvi damba bisa dibilang wanita semacam itu seribu satu adanya
4745994 vi aku pergi sebentar ya tadi ada janji dengan dik indri di warnet
4745995 itu dik indri minta bantuanku buat cari data makalah yang mau dia bahas di diskusi hari jumat besok soalnya dik indri dapet giliran
4745996 ya sudah aku tidak ikut yah ini lagi ada kerjaan mau nyelsaikan bacan yang sudah seminggu ini terlantar
4745997 kok tumben telpon kabarnya dik silvi sehat sehat saja kan
4745998 iya allah masih tak bosan memberikan karunia itu kepada kita semua semoga kita bisa mensyukurinya dengan bijak
4745999 iya mas ilham amin semoga kita tidak termasuk orang orang yang lalai mas ilham lagi apa
4746000 ini lagi buka buka buku kebetulan besok jumat mas ilham diminta jadi pemberi mauidhah hasanah di pesta pernikahan hasan temen sma mas lumayan lah dik walau keinginan mas ilham untuk menikah sampai kini belum juga tercapai tapi mas masih diberi kesempatan mencicipi kebahagiaan untuk membahagiakan teman teman yang mas sayangi sebagai muslim sudah semestinya kita turut berbahagia melihat saudara seiman kita berbahagia
4746001 bukankah niat seorang mumin lebih baik dari amalnya bukannya tidak mungkin ketika mas ilham mau membahagiakan orang yang sedang menikah terus allah membahagiakan dengan hal yang sama terus nasib seseorang itu tergantung pada niat yang dilakukan siapa yang berniat hijrah kepada allah swt dan rasulnya dia akan hijrah kearah allah swt dan rasulnya
4746002 iya mas ilham adik setuju moga kebaikan mas ilham dilipat gandakan dan segera diberikan ganti sama allah swt mas ilham sebenarnya silvi khawatir dengan mas silvi takut terjadi apa apa dengan mas ilham
4746003 yang penting kita tak berhenti untuk terus berikhtiar gitu kan mas ilham
4746004 iya benar sekali kalau belum waktunya mau bagaimana lagi mau dikejar sampai ujung dunia sekalipun juga tidak akan pernah bisa didapat ini dik silvi lagi di kostan apa dimana
4746005 iya di kostan tapi di kostan hanif itu lho yang pernah silvi ceritakan ke mas ilham kebetulan temen sekamarnya sedang pergi untuk pkl di surabaya jadi aku ikut ke kostan hanif biar bisa cerita cerita hanif enak banget buat diajak ngobrol masalah agama

4746008 ya sudah ayo cepat naik motor kakak kita ke warnet muslim yang deket marioboro saja disana penjaganya wanita yang baik dan ramah banget dia juga berjilbab walau belum sempurna terus disana pelanggan tidak bisa buka situs situs yang ngelanggar syariah jadi orang jahatnya insyaallah sedikit
4746009 ngomong ngomong dik indri mau bahas apa hari jumat besok
4746010 kalau boleh usul bagaimana kalau ntar dik indri kupas masalah pandangan feminisme antara islam dan barat atau bahas kebebasan dalam lingkup islam saja
4746011 kak sepertinya ana lebih cenderung ke tema kedua soalnya ana lihat banyak sekali yang salah dalam memahami kebebasan
4746012 ya pilihan yang tepat permasalahan itu selalu hangat untuk di ungkap di forum diskusi insyaallah temen temen bersemangat mengupasnya
4746013 kak ntar kalau sudah selesai ana ketik ana kirim ke kakak ya biar bisa di koreksi
4746014 iya ana akan berusaha sebisa mungkin untuk membantu dik indri
4746015 ilham kalau memang sekarang kamu ada uang lebih lebih baik kamu simpan dulu siapa tahu bisa bermanfaat untuk usahamu dan bisa untuk biaya sekolah kamu dan adikmu silvi
4746016 kebebasan bukan merupakan sarana untuk mencapai politik ideal namun secara substansial merupakan tujuan tertinggi politik
4746017 bila perempuan diwajibkan oleh islam untuk berkurung diri dirumah tidak perlu ada aturan berjilbab buat apa toh yang melihat si perempuan hanya suaminya sendiri atau ayahnya jilbab justru dipakai bila perempuan akan keluar rumah karena ada non mukhrim artinya wajib berjilbab berarti wajib keluar rumah dan wajib beraktivitas untuk memaksimalkan potensi kemanusiannya
4746018 islam memperkenalkan kebebasan sebagai puncak kekuatan dari penciptaan manusia dengan aqal dan bimbingan nabi manusia bisa terbang bebas menuju kesempurnaan

4746060 the movie touched by love was based on the book to elvis with love lena canadas now very rare memoir tells the powerful true story of lenas friendship and love for karen the young girl crippled and dying from the effects of cerebral palsy it is also the story of the power that elvis holds for many people in karens case the exchange of letters and gifts between elvis and her bring incredible joy and happiness to the remainder of her greatly shortened life
4746061 rockin on music if you like it if you feel it you cant help but move to it thats what happens to me i cant stand still ive tried it and i just cant do it
4746062 his kind of music is deplorable a rancid smelling aphrodisiac it fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people
4746063 i wanted to say to elvis presley and the country that this is a real decent fine boy
4746064 elvis was the king no doubt about it people like myself mick jagger and all the others only followed in his footsteps
4746065 a presley picture is the only sure thing in hollywood
4746066 a lot of people have accused elvis of stealing the black mans music when in fact almost every black solo entertainer copied his stage mannerisms from elvis
4746067 when i first heard elvis voice i just knew that i wasnt going to work for anybody and nobody was going to be my boss hearing him for the first time was like busting out of jail
4746068 elvis is the greatest cultural force in the twentieth century he introduced the beat to everything music language clothes its a whole new social revolution the 60s comes from it
4746069 there have been many accolades uttered about elvis talent and performances through the years all of which i agree with wholeheartedly i shall miss him dearly as a friend he was a warm considerate and generous man
4746070 elvis presleys death deprives our country of a part of itself he was unique irreplaceable more than twenty years ago he burst upon the scene with an impact that was unprecedented and will probably never be equaled his music and his personality fusing the styles of white country and black rhythm and blues permanently changed the face of american popular culture his following was immense and he was a symbol to people the world over of the vitality rebelliousness and good humor of this country
4746071 if life was fair elvis would be alive and all the impersonators would be dead
4746072 well never know what an old elvis presley would have been like hell just always be the king
4746073 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4746074 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4746075 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4746076 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4746077 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4746078 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4746079 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4746080 this therefore can only be yet another completely unverified statement
4746081 we are not conducting bombardments i can say with full responsibility that this cannot be the case
4746082 a top manager will always make a difference and weve got a top manager again
4746083 avram got a lot of criticism but he did well managers can be good in some departments and weak in others
4746084 but we had it out everyone spoke to the manager and said where we felt we could improve as a team how we could improve training and certain things off the pitch and he listened to them
4746085 i think i had to step up another level as captain last season the circumstances of last season demanded i take on extra responsibility we had avram who was very good and steve clarke and henk ten cate but weve got such a big squad and its not just the players who are playing but those who dont play who need to stay motivated that became my job to speak to the manager sometimes you have a three way conversation when the manager would explain why a player wasnt playing if a manager tells you why youre not playing its easier to deal with it if a manager isnt telling you why or how you can improve to get in the team that becomes frustrating and that was something i arranged last year
4746086 i had to remind myself im the captain of chelsea and that i have to lead the players and i had to focus on the new season the new players and the new manager
4746087 tactically he is very aware and when he talks everyone listens he has that aura about him he doesnt speak very often but when he does he gets the attention of everyone we needed that he likes to have a laugh and joke he also has that fear factor we havent really seen that side of him yet but im sure we will weve all read the stories about him ive even watched the video of scolari punching serbia defender ivica dragutinovic and when he occasionally raises his voice you think oh there it is

4746089 it is rather normal and usual for actors and actresses to be dressed in costumes from different ethnic groups there is nothing special about it
4746090 they all looked like han chinese it was clear to everyone at the start but i suppose they thought there was too much risk that even a child could make an unacceptable gesture
4746091 this is a very private question i understand that she was seriously injured but i am not sure whether she is paralysed or not she is hospitalised at this moment
4746092 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4746093 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them

4746098 beliau saiful menggunakan agama islam jenama apa kerana ia tidak merupakan hak dalam islam
4746099 bagaimana saiful bersumpah menggunakan quran sedangkan dia tidak tahu isu kandungan kitab suci itu
4746100 dia saiful boleh buat apa sahaja tetapi kita tidak boleh dengar sebelah pihak sahaja
4746101 oleh itu kita tidak mahu membuat hukuman awal seolah olah anwar telah bersalah
4746102 apabila membenarkan anwar bertanding dalam pilihanraya ia merupakan satu kaedah yang beliau tidak bersalah
4746103 dalam islam sesiapapun bebas bersumpah untuk membuktikan dirinya benar tetapi bukanlah dengan memegang kitab suci al quran kerana ia adalah perbuatan orang kristian yang memegang kitab mereka ketika bersumpah

4746117 het probleem is dat blijkbaar niemand nog diepe spits wil zijn als je aan een aanvaller vraagt welk type hij is dan zegt hij hangende spits niemand wil de verantwoordelijkheid van de diepe spits nog dragen of de kloppen van de diepe spits nog opvangen

4746135 we are much more worried by georgian imperialism than russian imperialism

4746137 when the front of the brain fires you want to see the back of the brain fire right back
4746138 unfortunately this connection seems to weaken with age so that older people can end up with a rather disconnected brain
4746139 and this variation was evident both in the brain and in observed behavior
4746140 the brain is a learning machine and like all machines it needs to be continually maintained
4746141 if you stop exercising the brain and this is what often happens during retirement then you shouldnt be surprised when it starts to die off
4746142 the brain operates on a use it or lose it principle
4746143 and the ability to cope with change seems to really be something you either use or lose
4746144 i hope that china comes in second and america will be first
4746145 its not our moment it would be too ambitious and too unreal to be the first in the olympics now
4746146 ninan should go to the united states because the best schools are there
4746147 the administration that became the target of so much passion and anger from democrats republicans independents foreigners martians everyone is not quite the one in place today the foreign policies that aroused the greatest anger and opposition were mostly pursued in bushs first term the invasion of iraq the rejection of treaties diplomacy and multilateralism in the past few years many of these policies have been modified abandoned or reversed this has happened without acknowledgment which is partly what drives critics crazy and its often been done surreptitiously it doesnt reflect a change of heart so much as an admission of failure the old way simply wasnt working but for whatever reasons and through whichever path the foreign policies in place now are more sensible moderate and mainstream in many cases the next president should follow rather than reverse them
4746148 granted the next president will feel the need to create an appearance of distance between himself and the unpopular bush yet the continuity between bush and his successor will be strong a u s drawdown from iraq will probably proceed more slowly than most expect relationships with india japan and vietnam will continue to grow the united states will continue to spend much more on military power than all other major countries combined financial pressures on iran will continue to intensify and even democracy promotion bushs most maligned foreign policy goal will continue to figure prominently in presidential addresses for years to come george w bushs political opponents will surely revile him long after hes gone but you can be sure of this just as the bush presidency led democrats to express an unexpected nostalgia for ronald reagan the next republican president can expect to hear from pundits and academics alike that he falls far short of the high standard set by the last one
4746149 judged on its own terms the war on terror has been by far bushs greatest success no serious observer imagined after september 11 that seven years would go by without a single additional terrorist attack on u s soil only naked partisanship and a justifiable fear of tempting fate have prevented the bush administration from getting or taking credit for what most would have regarded seven years ago as a near miracle much of the bush administrations success moreover has been due to extensive international cooperation especially with the european powers in the areas of intelligence sharing law enforcement and homeland security whatever else the bush administration has failed to do it has not failed to protect americans from another attack on the homeland the next administration will be fortunate to be able to say the same and will be contrasted quite unfavorably with the bush administration if it cannot
4746150 we make our own decisions about what we consider newsworthy
4746151 the nomination of the first african american presidential nominee after a bitter primary campaign and his efforts to unite a party afterward were simply more newsworthy than a candidate whose nomination was already assured and who spent much of that time raising money in the end we can and should be judged on the fairness of our coverage but that is a judgment that must be made over the course of the whole campaign not a single period of time
4746152 do we really want our daughters reading books about a girl like bella who is always needing to be saved
4746153 what passes for optimism is most often the effect of an intellectual error

4746157 and thats how we get competitive in the indianas and virginias
4746158 thats why i pay more attention to the registration figures than to the polls i see at this time of year
4746159 the polls will change but we know we need 200 000 new voters to be competitive in georgia and now is when we have to get them
4746160 the big difference this year is not the technology its the coordination

4746167 wir m ssen immer noch improvisieren die nachz gler sind noch nicht auf dem leistungsstand um in der bundesliga 90 minuten zu gehen wir brauchen noch einige zeit um den gew nschten spielfluss zu entwickeln
4746168 als trainer will man im ersten spiel nat rlich einen dreier einfahren das ist ganz klar wir waren auch auf einem guten weg haben den hsv durch den elfmeter zum 2 2 aber wieder zur ckgeholt wenn man alles addiert war es ein gerechtes ergebnis nach dieser zerfahrenen vorbereitung und mit den vielen verletzten muss man zufrieden sein auch wenn ich ein klein wenig entt uscht bin
4746169 es ist berhaupt nicht stressig sondern es macht irrsinnig spa wir trainer wollen es nicht anders wir wollen das adrenalin sp ren und am liebsten selbst mitspielen man ist auf strom
4746170 das muss man so nehmen wie es jetzt ist es ist vorgabe der liga an die schiedsrichter rigoroser zu werke zu gehen das hat thorsten kinh fer gemacht das ist vollkommen in ordnung
4746171 es gibt noch eine menge arbeit aber ich habe bei einzelnen spielern fortschritte gesehen die mannschaft sp rt langsam dass immer mehr frische und bewegung reinkommt wir kommen auch der feinabstimmung n her wir m ssen aber immer noch improvisieren wir brauchen noch einige zeit um den gew nschten spielfluss zu entwickeln und berall druck zu machen vor allem die nachz gler sind noch nicht auf dem leistungsstand um in der bundesliga 90 minuten zu gehen

4746182 the awards ceremony is a highly symbolic ritual acknowledged as such by all athletes and other participants
4746183 any disruption by any athlete in particular a medalist is in itself an insult to the other athletes and to the olympic movement it is also contrary to the spirit of fair play

4746222 oddly its referred to as the hipster scene germans will save our newspaper industry
4746223 and your point is what nobody said it was proof that all layers everywhere at all times in earths history have formed quickly what i have been saying over and over and over which apparently took you two weeks to figure out is that these layers had to have formed quickly you cannot have a living tree or a dead tree taking millions of years to be buried in a vertical position by horizontal layers is that so difficult why the straw man argument now now that you realize the problem with polystrate trees and the problem with carbon dating perhaps we can advance beyond kindergarten and explain to you that all of the radiometric dating schemes operate in open systems are seriously flawed and not reliable for dating the age of the earth obviously if the trees do not represent millions of years of sedimentation neither do the fossils found in the same layers represent millions of years of evolution rather what you see is the sequence in which things were rapidly buried
4746224 mutations kill the host or atleast make em sick and do not get passed down to offspring so how did both male and female evolve
4746225 radiometric methodologies would have to be out by a factor of 3 4 of a million
4746226 polystrate trees prove several things 1 the layers that they penetrate did not take millions of years to form 2 coal does not take millions of years to form since polystrate trees sometimes penetrate multiple seams 3 coal is formed from floating trees not peat 4 the rock strata between the coal layers did not take millions of years to form 5 the fossils embedded within the strata do not represent millions of years of evolution
4746227 1 that is not all that hard to explain 2 hello one ringy dingy two ringy dingy i dont either apology accepted if that is what it was like i said we can move beyond kindergarten if you will stop throwing your bottle out of the crib and screaming for your binky
4746228 starlight has not arrived here after millions of years whether big bang or creation the stars have stretched out from a central point accelerated to where they are and continue to expand starlight cannot be used to date anything
4746229 the age of the universe has changed many times with the age of the earth at one time the sun was known to be 90 000 000 miles closer to earth than now claimed
4746230 the other side of the coin is that as of yet there is no evidence outside of manipulating the bible for a 6000 year old earth
4746231 so it is easily possible that a polystrate tree could form 300 million years ago and then have further deposits to complete the coal seams
4746232 also you have made a point that these trees do not have roots do you have any ideas because i dont this is a question for both sides of the camp to answer
4746233 no it is the peat layers being compressed that is a much more obvious conclusion this invalidate 1 to 5
4746234 where are these coal seams and you have yet to answer my question as to the lady involved with the
4746235 it questions the assumption that the speed of light has always been the same this is a reasonable assumption since we have absolutely no evidence that the speed of light has ever been different or even of any mechanisms that can increase the speed
4746236 if you had checked into the msh information you would already know what i was saying here i did not say that all of the logs sank to form the coal rather it appears that occasionally one sinks heavy end first to become a polystrate tree penetrating multiple strata but the coal itself is composed mostly of the bark that falls from the trees as they are moved to and fro by the violent action of wind waves and tides that is why the coal beds are thin and seldom more than a few feet in thickness logs embedded through coal seams are petrified permineralized coalified depending on temperature chemical conditions and sediment content yes the trees provide the carbon
4746237 i never manipulate the bible i take it as written
4746238 our camp has already answered the question the trees were floating not growing they had been ripped loose from the soil where they grew and many of them lacked not only roots and rootlets but the entire root ball violent global flood action is the only condition capable of producing such evidence on such a grand global scale
4746239 there was no evidence of a peat bog and nobody claimed that all of the logs were coalified nothing is invalidated
4746240 the flood waters were upon the earth for about a year most logs will float for more than a year bark that is rubbed off will not float for very long ive seen bays on the west coast full of floating logs and not a shred of bark on any of them i think the logs mostly ended up on top of the ground and rotted to form soil
4746241 im not your babysitter and im tired of you spitting your pablum all over the place if you had actually checked the links and read the quote your first question wouldnt have been asked and you wouldnt have been ignorant enough to word the second question the way you did
4746242 light has been manipulated like that in a lab because they are making it travel through different mediums which distort the speed of light while traveling through a vacuum like space the speed of light is constant the constant speed of light is one of the fundamental premises of special relativity
4746243 well there is no statement in the bible that says 5000 6000 years or whatever it is so you had to manipulate it
4746244 sorry for the cut and paste i know you dont like that sort of stuff but i was at work and had limited time i find that by using a scientists own words would be more credible to you apparently i was wrong but if you want to leave red shift alone fine by me it only works with the big bang any way and you seem to relise that thats a bad theory all around
4746245 god exists xxxxx is the only correct religion and god made the world and its diversity
4746246 ob ser va tion noun 1 an act or instance of noticing or perceiving 2 an act or instance of regarding attentively or watching 3 the faculty or habit of observing or noticing 4 notice to escape a persons observation
4746247 i typed that out just for you youve used this term quite a bit and since its a key ingrediant in the scientific method that we have to observe what is happening the moment we stop observing and go only on a hypothisis or theory we are leaving the realm of science you would agree wouldnt you
4746248 lets see what we can observe even with the worlds most powerful telescope a star is still a dot of light
4746249 theres a good doc on it also another weird theory theres your favorite word is that the sun is hollow and close up examinations of sun spots reveal this but what do you care for such things being taught in a un classroom see robert muller you want to talk of the spped of light
4746250 roughly 8 min and 34 sec it takes to get here from the sun i remember that from school didnt look it up but as my brothers have already stated the speed of light is effected by gravity mass and acceleration a lab in i believe australia im guessing not gonna look it up just for you stopped light in a lab not just stopped it but speeded it up considering light exists as a particle and a ray it would be folly to think its speed is a constant but then again they said the speed of sound would never be broken just the fact that a black hole and no one really knows what one is can trap light clearly states that the speed is not a constant
4746251 oh cosmology is really a religon when you think about it i mean its all about where we came from and how everything began it just dosent claim one way is the only way
4746252 no doofus all i had to do was get out my calculator and add up the years in the genealogies duh contrived indeed the information about coal forming from bark has been around for years yet your crowd keeps pushing the peat bog fantasy which has never been proven to produce any quantity of coal get a life

4746255 the rationale for destroying the tapes to protect the identity of the interrogators is almost as embarrassing as the destruction itself
4746256 said saltzburg who is also general counsel for the national institute of military justice he said that the tapes could easily have been modified to obscure the faces of those involved and that regardless the cia keeps a written record of which officers interrogated detainees
4746257 and so the explanation for destruction fails the straight face test
4746258 the only plausible explanation i believe is that the cia wanted to assure that those tapes would never be seen by any judicial tribunal not even a military commission and they would never be seen by a committee of congress
4746259 with the cia tapes gone we have the ultimate cover up the indisputable evidence no longer exists and memories will undoubtedly differ about what happened
4746260 its vitally important for this congress to recognize that its part of the interrogation process
4746261 this congress decided not to restrict the cia at least not explicitly and it decided not to confine the cia to interrogation techniques that are contained in the army field manual
4746262 if we agree that the conduct on those tapes is torture that person who did the conduct is guilty thats for sure
4746263 because if true we may be facing the possibility of a dangerous and criminal abuse of powers at the highest levels of our government
4746264 i dont know whether thats illegal or not but its certainly wrong
4746265 the commission was dissatisfied with the answers it received to these questions
4746266 the cia went to great lengths to meet the requests of the 9 11 commission and provided the commission with a wealth of information
4746267 because it was thought the commission could ask about tapes at some point they were not destroyed while the commission was active
4746268 as director michael hayden pointed out in his december 6th statement the tapes were destroyed only when it was determined they were no longer of intelligence value and not relevant to any internal legislative or judicial inquiries
4746269 until these inquiries are complete until the oversights finished i will be rendering no opinion from the podium
4746270 the notion that the cia wasnt cooperative or forthcoming with the 9 11 commission is just plain wrong it is utterly without foundation
4746271 the cias cooperation and assistance is what enabled the 9 11 commission to reconstruct the plot in their very comprehensive report
4746272 because it was thought the commission could ask about tapes at some point they were not destroyed while the commission was active
4746273 the tapes were destroyed only when it was determined they were no longer of intelligence value and not relevant to any internal legislative or judicial inquiries
4746274 none of the government officials in any of these 2004 meetings alluded to the existence of recordings of interrogations or any further information in the governments possession that was relevant to the commissions requests
4746275 taken and completed all reasonable steps necessary to find the documents in its possession custody or control responsive
4746276 he would be executed for disparaging the reputation of a member of the royal family
4746277 which one u s investigator refers to as the rosetta stone of 9 11
4746278 this information is totally false and groundless i have had no contacts with bin laden since 1990 and have never had contacts with al qaida which is a satanic terrorist organization
4746279 reports at the time said that the pilot had been changed just minutes before takeoff
4746280 zubaydahs interrogation leaves some questions unanswered which i think will eventually be run to ground
4746281 hes recanted his story hes said he just picked these names out of a hat to spare himself some torture but is it possible that he picked out three saudi princes and the head of the pakistani air force and then they all just had the bad luck of dying the three saudis within days of each other after the u s shared the information and from a blood clot a car wreck dehydration and a plane crash i guess technically its possible people do win the lottery but as i view it its extremely unlikely
4746282 hes the j edgar hoover of saudi arabia if anybody has all the goods on the highest members of the royal family their sex lives their use of prostitutes when they visit europe etc its him
4746283 if anyone made payments to bin laden and al qaida it would be turki given his connections to them through the 80s
4746284 sleeping with the devil how washington sold our soul for saudi crude
4746285 turki arranged for things like sending cars to the taliban and free gas for pakistan and afghanistan and he supported the islamic movement in sudan it was his job but ive never seen any evidence that turki himself was complicit in terrorism
4746286 the top levels of the regime including prince turki would be extremely leery of any kind of political deal with al qaida when al qaida had already attacked inside the kingdom and the al qaida leadership was openly calling for the overthrow of the saudi regime
4746287 if the saudis were more deeply involved in al qaida operations i think you would expect to have seen some different behavior from the saudi government after the east africa embassy and uss cole bombings
4746288 i think you wouldve seen more direct saudi contact with the taliban after that and im not aware of evidence of any high level saudi visitors there
4746289 i did a huge amount of interviewing for my book and even with the people who were the most antagonistic toward the musharraf government nobody mentioned even the remote possibility that pakistan had been at all complicit in sept 11 in a specific way ive heard nothing about government officials knowing in advance that something was going to happen even if they didnt know what or where
4746290 its the pakistani army that really runs the country the nine corps commanders and its security branch the isi its really a nation within the state the air force and the navy arent as important or influential ive never met anybody from the isi who hasnt been from the army
4746291 my view is this didnt come from inside the active intelligence community but from an administration source a neoconservative whos promoting it who also provided a former cia officer for confirmation
4746292 we know a great deal about the training planning and operational details of 9 11 now that khalid sheik mohammed is in custody and is talking hes the key person here the person who orchestrated 9 11 abu zubaydah was not i doubt posner had access to the zubaydah debriefing though one of his sources probably did but the point is none of his sources had access to the debriefing on the person who is the key figure here
4746293 i dont buy the idea that a serving case officer involved in the zubaydah debriefing leaked this information
4746294 to me that would be an extraordinary act its too great a risk cia officers have to take polygraphs and internal leaks are taken very seriously people lose their jobs their careers its not like working at the department of agriculture or at the white house apparently where you can blow someone out of the water out of pure vindictiveness
4746295 anything can be made to look conspiratorial when you start putting together a number of things that might otherwise be random in nature were these deaths perpetrated by an embarrassed royal family that didnt want the zubaydah information to get out thats just a little bit far fetched
4746296 if you gave me all the al qaida interrogations i could go through them if i wanted to and cherry pick stuff that collectively could destroy relations between saudi arabia and the u s
4746297 people i know close to the administration who follow this tell me that the administration is ultimately behind saudi arabia not because of the bush family relations with the royal family but because its the pin that holds together the gulf and therefore our economy
4746298 with all the arrests there since the may 12 bombing in riyadh what the saudis have learned to their dismay is that bin laden has a lot of support in the government and the royal family its such a huge family and there are a lot of princes who resent everything about the west the saudi rulers have now said openly that theyre in a battle for their lives and they know they have enemies embedded throughout the family
4746299 call them what you will terrorists arab nationalists crazies theyre in the police the army and the government
4746300 my information is that investigators there were blown away when they started arresting all these people they found cellphones and those arrested had the numbers to call into the command center of the ministry of the interior
4746301 what we told them was these people were on our watch list from previous activities of al qaida in both the embassy bombings and attempts to smuggle arms into the kingdom in 1997
4746302 you can break off diplomatic relations you can impose economic sanctions and you have ultimately the option of seizing the oil fields militarily if you have to

4746306 young saudi men have joined the sunni insurgency as foreign fighters while there have been persistent reports that saudi citizens have provided financial aid to the sunni insurgency
4746307 major saudi tribal confederations have extremely close historical and communal ties with their counterparts in iraq

4746372 a fines de mayo de 2008 me llam una fuente de informaci n oficial a efectos de presentarme a un supuesto
4746373 arreglamos en encontrarnos al d a siguiente en una confiter a ubicada en la intersecci n de las calles viamonte y paran de esta capital federal
4746374 nos sentamos los cinco en el lugar central de la confiter a y nos dispusimos a almorzar forza me hab a impresionado fuertemente no s lo por su elegante vestimenta imposible de costear para un periodista como yo sino por la seguridad que demostraba en cada una de sus afirmaciones
4746375 sebasti n comenz a describir una diab lica trama de corrupci n que involucraba a laboratorios medicinales organismos p blicos e instituciones privadas algunas de sus afirmaciones
4746376 hitler eva braun y 13 jerarcas nazis aterrizaron en barcelona el 27 de abril de 1945 en un vuelo que parti de berl n e hizo escala en linz austria
4746377 viajaron en un junker 290 n mero de serie 0163 c digo pipq que tiempo despu s fue localizado por los aliados en un aeropuerto naval de la localidad de travem nde cercana a hamburgo
4746378 apenas fue un trampol n para el escape de hitler en submarino hacia suram rica
4746379 el documento del fbi fechado en mayo de 1947 cobra valor uniendo todos estos datos hist ricos aunque mi teor a es que hitler estuvo en espa a no m s de un mes y ya hab a abandonado ese pa s cuando el ej rcito estadounidense lo busc all
4746380 los alemanes dejaron cad veres en los b nkers con credenciales de sus jerarcas para que el mundo creyera que se trataba de ellos incluso se utilizaron varios dobles de hitler
4746381 hab a recibido varios cad veres que pertenec an supuestamente a hitler
4746382 go north on route 192 until it junctions with i 90 then head west

4746384 in view of the placental lakes and low lying placenta we will scan at 28 and 34 weeks respectively
4746385 now that we have got a proper manager came the verdict from chelseas captain mid summer as luiz felipe scolari the world cup winning brazilian succeeded avram grant the remark was as brutal as it was true
4746386 the movie touched by love was based on the book to elvis with love lena canadas now very rare memoir tells the powerful true story of lenas friendship and love for karen the young girl crippled and dying from the effects of cerebral palsy it is also the story of the power that elvis holds for many people in karens case the exchange of letters and gifts between elvis and her bring incredible joy and happiness to the remainder of her greatly shortened life
4746387 rockin on music if you like it if you feel it you cant help but move to it thats what happens to me i cant stand still ive tried it and i just cant do it
4746388 his kind of music is deplorable a rancid smelling aphrodisiac it fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people
4746389 i wanted to say to elvis presley and the country that this is a real decent fine boy
4746390 elvis was the king no doubt about it people like myself mick jagger and all the others only followed in his footsteps
4746391 a presley picture is the only sure thing in hollywood
4746392 a lot of people have accused elvis of stealing the black mans music when in fact almost every black solo entertainer copied his stage mannerisms from elvis
4746393 when i first heard elvis voice i just knew that i wasnt going to work for anybody and nobody was going to be my boss hearing him for the first time was like busting out of jail
4746394 elvis is the greatest cultural force in the twentieth century he introduced the beat to everything music language clothes its a whole new social revolution the 60s comes from it
4746395 there have been many accolades uttered about elvis talent and performances through the years all of which i agree with wholeheartedly i shall miss him dearly as a friend he was a warm considerate and generous man
4746396 elvis presleys death deprives our country of a part of itself he was unique irreplaceable more than twenty years ago he burst upon the scene with an impact that was unprecedented and will probably never be equaled his music and his personality fusing the styles of white country and black rhythm and blues permanently changed the face of american popular culture his following was immense and he was a symbol to people the world over of the vitality rebelliousness and good humor of this country
4746397 if life was fair elvis would be alive and all the impersonators would be dead
4746398 well never know what an old elvis presley would have been like hell just always be the king

4746404 hey daily star ive got a wart on my finger
4746405 it has been an amazing experience for me last year i was at the under 23 level and this year i jumped into senior level with ramon
4746406 we went from a c final 13 to 18 place at munich to fifth in the a final in the olympics
4746407 for me its just a major achievement to be up there racing with the best in the world im just disappointed that we never got a medal for as much as they are the best in the world we want to be better
4746408 its been pushing and squeezing every day to try and get up to speed in six months i think this last race was just a bit too much for us
4746409 theres been anxiety and nerves every day to get up there because we have to improve thats not a normal training environment and it took a lot out of us but weve been up to the challenge
4746410 weve had a great regatta and really tried our utmost to stick with the best but its been a huge accomplishment to be in the final
4746411 this is the smallest squad ive ever had to start a season
4746412 but we knew the situation at the end of last season when there were players facing surgery and we didnt have a lot of numbers we didnt foresee one or two things but we were aware how it could be
4746413 i understand the situation ive started to build something here ive been here six years and to me now that doesnt seem that long its actually quite a short time
4746414 when you become the manager you have to win with whatever you have got thats my job now and i will try to do that hopefully it can make me and the club stronger and from this maybe something good can come from it
4746415 its going to take time for the players to gel into how we want to play so it isnt going to happen overnight
4746416 but the most important thing is to perform and play the right way you have got to entertain and i have always got my teams to do that
4746417 even when we were at the bottom of the table with macclesfield and with mk dons last year i had my teams playing very good football and i want the same here at blackburn
4746418 i never thought i wanted to turn my back on this i have never thought about quitting my biggest responsibility is to the players here
4746419 i feel loyal to the supporters and everyone at the club but even more so to my players

4746434 a lot of work has been done to identify contributors to the fund and i am optimistic that it will be a success
4746435 i am confident that there will be robust sources for this funding
4746436 the agreed figure is more than sufficient to deal with the claims
4746437 this is coming into fruition after a great deal of work and i look forward to going to libya as well

4746441 i suspected something when i found the first bird in gabon since it didnt exactly match any of the species descriptions in the field guides
4746442 once i was able to compare them side by side to other specimens in our collections it was clear that these birds were special you of course have to be cautious but i was still very excited at the prospect of possibly having found a new species of bird
4746443 the most intriguing finding was that subjects seemed to accept mushrooms as a palatable and suitable culinary substitute for meat
4746444 they didnt compensate for the lower calorie mushroom meal by eating more food later in the day

4746474 by the time we finish our control lines well add to the acres it wont be because the fire is still out of control it will be because we had to fall back to a point were we can actually put fire on the ground and burn from it
4746475 our motto is a windmill on every corner we cant get enough of them
4746476 im quite convinced that wind power is a good thing but its all about location
4746477 i just think we need to go slower be more deliberative and show some respect for the people who live here
4746478 the community response in aroostook county has been as positive as anywhere we have worked in the country which is great to see
4746479 this is a potentially significant investment on a scale that would be remarkable in the countys history
4746480 ive been making a living off of my land for the last 36 years and i can tell you its getting harder and harder the taxes are killing us
4746481 they are mostly agriculture oriented so they understand the diversity of their land
4746482 they are more willing to experiment with things and frankly it is in those areas where you would like to see more economic development
4746483 but my main point is the towns people and by that i mean all residents of voting age should have a say in whether this is going to come or not
4746484 a development in aroostook county is years away and before there can be any development there will be a very public process
4746485 i think its good we did what we did because we raised awareness
4746486 i dont think this is an unusual situation here in mars hill its going to be repeated
4746487 we had a beautiful horizon and now all we see is turbines
4746488 the reason people bought here is because of the view
4746489 weve got a huge investment so we cant afford to pick up and move
4746490 we need more electricity in this country and wind provides a very good balance to what we have right now
4746491 i understand why people would be concerned and want to explore these issues but beauty is in the eye of the beholder for some people they represent a new era where we are getting smarter about energy choices
4746492 these landmen with leases come into the area like termites and by the time they come to the surface its almost too late but we found out about it soon enough
4746493 thats why we need to stop people from leasing for the wind turbines theres a whole group theyll have to cross and were united
4746494 fpl energy is the largest wind provider in the united states and texas and we could not do what we do without landowner partnerships
4746495 every evening we sit out there on that patio and have a glass of tea and watch the sun go down
4746496 now we get to go out there and watch blinking lights its just a sea of lights
4746497 by creating lwuit sun is reaffirming its commitment to the mobile development community and by open sourcing the lwuit code we are enabling mobile developers to quickly and easily create rich portable interfaces for their applications
4746498 this software will also help address the mobile industrys fragmentation issue by enabling developers to create a single interface that will work anywhere java is found
4746499 to further accelerate the adoption of the lwuit framework it is important to provide access to the source code under a liberal and well known open source license
4746500 this license choice provides the benefits of open source innovation and collaborative development while offering a risk free path to adoption by commercial products a model everybody should feel very comfortable with
4746501 proprietary software companies such as microsoft corp have tried to stop the adoption of open source software by various governments around the world last november the initiative for software choice a coalition backed by big industry giants such as microsoft and intel sent a letter to the director of the office of information technology at the ministry of science and technology arturo gallegos warning the venezuelan government against adopting open source software

4746507 you cant be a responsible member of institutions which are democratic and underscore democratic values and on the other hand act in this way against one of your neighbours
4746508 russia has every time been testing the reaction of the west its going to replicate what happened in georgia elsewhere
4746509 we are looking evil directly in the eye today this evil is very strong and very dangerous for everybody not just for us
4746510 georgia has been attacked russian forces need to leave georgia at once
4746511 must take place and take place now this is no longer 1968
4746512 our ground forces never crossed the border of the conflict zone
4746513 but the problem is that the abkhazians and the ossetians do not trust anyone except russian peacekeepers

4746538 the tv helicopter is always in the air when a race plane is flying
4746539 we are up there before the start of the flying to make sure that everything is okay
4746540 it is a safety tool we have a direct radio with the race directors and we are looking for any weather issues wind birds in the race box or boats which might be crossing
4746541 if something happens i am the first one on the spot and together with the race director i evaluate what to do
4746542 sometimes we are up to two to three metres close to them on the track in order to get these spectacular pictures
4746543 we have to stay in the position which is the best position for pictures it is not always the best position wind wise
4746544 in the helicopter i can tell two seconds before they hit a pylon i know or i can tell that they are coming in at the wrong angle
4746545 but i think that on both sides there is respect for each other we have built up trust with the race pilots
4746546 sometimes we are flying up to 50 centimetres beside them beside the wings and you can only do that if you know them off by heart and they know you by heart so you know exactly what they are going to
4746547 the movie touched by love was based on the book to elvis with love lena canadas now very rare memoir tells the powerful true story of lenas friendship and love for karen the young girl crippled and dying from the effects of cerebral palsy it is also the story of the power that elvis holds for many people in karens case the exchange of letters and gifts between elvis and her bring incredible joy and happiness to the remainder of her greatly shortened life

4746550 i wanted to say to elvis presley and the country that this is a real decent fine boy
4746551 elvis was the king no doubt about it people like myself mick jagger and all the others only followed in his footsteps
4746552 a presley picture is the only sure thing in hollywood
4746553 a lot of people have accused elvis of stealing the black mans music when in fact almost every black solo entertainer copied his stage mannerisms from elvis
4746554 when i first heard elvis voice i just knew that i wasnt going to work for anybody and nobody was going to be my boss hearing him for the first time was like busting out of jail
4746555 elvis is the greatest cultural force in the twentieth century he introduced the beat to everything music language clothes its a whole new social revolution the 60s comes from it
4746556 there have been many accolades uttered about elvis talent and performances through the years all of which i agree with wholeheartedly i shall miss him dearly as a friend he was a warm considerate and generous man
4746557 elvis presleys death deprives our country of a part of itself he was unique irreplaceable more than twenty years ago he burst upon the scene with an impact that was unprecedented and will probably never be equaled his music and his personality fusing the styles of white country and black rhythm and blues permanently changed the face of american popular culture his following was immense and he was a symbol to people the world over of the vitality rebelliousness and good humor of this country
4746558 if life was fair elvis would be alive and all the impersonators would be dead
4746559 well never know what an old elvis presley would have been like hell just always be the king

4746561 my own view is that now is not the time to renew or refurbish city chambers furniture
4746562 in the last few months school budgets have been cut nursery school hot meals have been abandoned numerous voluntary organisations have seen funding reduced and community centres are losing full time workers
4746563 when front line services in edinburgh are being cut across the board this seems at the very least to be ill judged timing
4746564 this historic furniture is a civic asset different people put a different price on preserving our heritage but this administration considers that we should take advantage of this opportunity not only to preserve it but to see it in practical use within the city chambers
4746565 to do otherwise would mean selling the chairs or allowing them to decay and neither would be the right decision for the city
4746566 the desks and chairs belong to the city not the council
4746567 we take the strongest exception to this it is absolutely wrong
4746568 this is extremely offensive to the thousands of men and women who have served under the union flag
4746569 the image is merely a visitscotland montage used to promote homecoming 2009 adding fireworks and a saltire to the castle since the saltire is the badge of homecoming

4746616 its important for people to know that he williams and toulon contacted us
4746617 we havent gone chasing any of this we were prepared to take the matter to court and make him accountable and still are if an agreement is not reached
4746618 a financial settlement is going to be found at the beginning of next week
4746619 the fact he has decided not to defy the injunction sends a clear message to people who want to break their contract
4746620 how long he stays on the sidelines is one of the issues that has been raised
4746621 ive said on a few occasions that the issue is that not only does his departure impact on us on the field but also off the field
4746622 an impact across the whole business current and future players supporters sponsors we need to take all that into account on the next range of discussions with toulon
4746623 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4746624 the line between lack of information and secrecy is rather thin
4746625 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4746626 i dont need no stinkin benchmark because i only use index funds so my portfolio is the benchmark
4746627 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4746628 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
4746629 each mutual fund you invest in should have its own benchmark even if it is an index fund and your portfolio should be an appropriate fixed mix of those benchmarks the benchmarks should all be capitalization weighted indexes that represent the investable universe in that asset class
4746630 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4746631 t he option should exist to invest in the benchmark as an alternative to the portfolio under consideration
4746632 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4746633 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm

4746636 absolute return portfolio produced an annualized 13 1 percent exceeding the passive benchmark of the
4746637 as sort of a clearing house for proper portfolios benchmarking
4746638 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4746639 that problem is pretty easily solved by calculating a portfolios time weighted return rather than irr or dollar weighted return and comparing the twr to the benchmark return twr removes the impact of cash flows on portfolio performance
4746640 you bring up a major issue with performance measurement cash flows in a portfolio are handled differently than cash flows in an index so there will always be some irr tracking error in between the portfolio and the index in an index it is assumed that the dividend is paid on the ex dividend date and reinvested in the index however in a portfolio the divided does not come in until the dividend payment date and then it might take another day or so to reinvest so by default using irr the portfolio cannot match the irr of the index
4746641 for example if you start with 10 000 and then add 1 00 000 during a year there is a twr return calculation from the 10 000 contribution to the date the 1 000 000 was added then there is second calculation starting the day of the 1 000 000 contribution
4746642 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4746643 the whole point of calculating the portfolio twr is to remove the effect of cash flows on performance thereby making a comparison to a benchmark relevent the benchmark returns do not have any cash flows associated with them and neither does the portfolios twr so its an apples to apples comparison
4746644 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4746645 there is a little moment at the end when bowfinger martin is at the premiere of his movie he has battled all the odds and he somehow managed it and frank oz does this little push in on bowfingers face and the look of innocent awe just choked me up it was capped off with the final hoorah for our hero when the fed ex guy who for years had passed bowfingers house bringing important deal memos to important people day in day out came to deliver a deal to bowfinger its just beautifully heartwarming and would give regular folk a lump in their throat while theyre grinning along with the characters but for me well it had me buckled

4746755 constantly cheerful stone agers would have lolled about grinning while their wounds festered their crops died and bears devoured their children
4746756 human beings did not get where they are today by being sanguine about imperfection
4746757 the meek would have no world to inherit if the more petulant did not set about building one fit to last
4746758 complaint is a secular humanist act it is resistance against the idea that suffering is our divinely ordained lot and that we can do no more than put up with it piously
4746759 like a libertine who wants his innumerable conquests to be chaste virgins
4746760 the price we pay for our advance in civilisation is a loss of happiness
4746761 what man among you if he has a hundred sheep and has lost one of them does not leave the ninety nine in the open pasture and go after the one which is lost until he finds it
4746762 when he has found it he lays it on his shoulders rejoicing
4746763 and when he comes home he calls together his friends and his neighbors saying to them rejoice with me for i have found my sheep which was lost
4746764 i tell you that in the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety nine righteous persons who need no repentance

4746769 we started with just a small strip of a garden

4746772 our goal is to get the iphone client out as quickly as possible because it does represent a significant percentage of the devices touching our network

4746780 we agreed at the security organ that the agreement should be signed within the period of the summit
4746781 all the parties appear to be agreeable to reaching an agreement this weekend but its a wait and see situation
4746782 we are still awaiting a full prognosis of the mans injuries but early indications show that he has been the victim of a very serious assault
4746783 if anyone was around the london road area at the time and may have information that could help i would appeal to them to come forward
4746784 bila anda belum pernah bertemu muka secara langsung sebaiknya anda tidak memasukkan seseorang dalam daftar teman di dunia maya

4746787 we didnt do the gas subsidy program absent a thought
4746788 we certainly werent trying to encourage people to go out and drive more
4746789 we did it to be responsive to our customers who were telling us that fuel prices were top of mind we did it to give them peace of mind over the next three years
4746790 what i can tell you is that we are not operating under the not invented here syndrome
4746791 we are going to have to have some alliances some partnerships
4746792 they do everything online it is their primary way of staying in contact with family and friends back home their primary way of communicating with each other in the states if you are not online they dont see you

4746801 we cant have an effective fuel conservation policy without asking consumers to give up something but who wants to be the first car company to tell consumers that
4746802 i cant afford the higher rents around here i wont be going anywhere for at least another year
4746803 this summit affords us the possibility to assist the zimbabwean parties to finalise their negotiations so that together they can engage the work to achieve national healing and reconciliation
4746804 attend to the matter of reconstruction and development of zimbabwe and in this way extricate the masses of the people from the dire straits in which they find themselves
4746805 im certain that the millions of zimbabweans both inside and outside zimbabwe await with great expectations and high hopes a positive outcome from our deliberations
4746806 not a single turkish cypriot wants or dares to speak up and defend cypriot interests
4746807 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4746808 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4746809 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4746810 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4746811 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4746812 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4746813 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4746814 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4746815 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4746816 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4746817 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4746818 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4746819 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4746820 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4746821 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4746822 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4746823 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4746824 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4746825 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4746826 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4746827 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4746828 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4746829 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4746830 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4746831 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4746832 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4746833 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4746834 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4746835 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4746836 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4746837 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4746838 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4746839 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4746840 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4746841 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4746842 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4746843 this is a planning took where all things are going
4746844 mik n ei viittaa siihen ett ven l iset olisivat vet ytym ss
4746845 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4746846 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4746847 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4746848 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4746849 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4746850 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4746851 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4746852 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4746853 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4746854 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4746855 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4746856 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4746857 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4746858 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that

4746861 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4746862 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4746863 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4746864 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4746865 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4746866 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4746867 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4746868 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4746869 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

4746875 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4746876 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4746877 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4746878 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4746879 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4746880 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4746881 while going through our records recently we found that your adsense account has posed a significant risk to our adwords advertisers
4746882 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4746883 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4746884 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4746885 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4746886 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4746887 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4746888 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4746889 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4746890 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4746891 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4746892 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4746893 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4746894 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4746895 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4746896 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4746897 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4746898 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4746899 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4746900 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4746901 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4746902 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4746903 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4746904 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4746905 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4746906 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4746907 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4746908 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4746909 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4746910 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4746911 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4746912 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4746913 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4746914 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4746915 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4746916 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4746917 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4746918 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally

4746937 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4746938 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4746939 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4746940 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4746992 we are thinking of nothing else but winning were at home and we want to win as many of our home games as possible to give ourselves a platform
4746993 it should be a big occasion first home league game of the season there should be a good atmosphere hopefully the weather will be better than last week
4746994 were all aware of how much it means to the fans i think perhaps thats sometimes why we get a little anxious at home because were that desperate to do well
4746995 sometimes when its not coming off you start to hear the crowd getting on your back to try and force things now and again
4746996 everyone here is big enough and strong enough to take stick its our jobs and part of that
4746997 everyone is desperate to do that for the molineux crowd because there is no better feeling than winning at molineux
4746998 it would be good to improve our home form next season
4746999 our away form last season was reasonably good we were able to go away to teams even if we werent playing our best football and we were able to frustrate teams maybe getting goals on the break through the likes of sylvan and andy keogh
4747000 if we could just pick up those sort of points away from home the odd win and draw and then make molineux the fortress that it should be then wed have a great chance
4747001 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4747002 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4747003 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century
4747004 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west
4747005 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis
4747006 the legislature and the governor changed our marriage laws to please the well connected minority and force a social experiment into other states thats very offensive to a majority of the people at least the way the votes have been going
4747007 the fact that this happened the way it happened just adds to the sense of sleaziness and underhandedness of the whole process
4747008 ive learned that when it comes to equality for gay and lesbian people the struggle is never over because there are certain people that are just strongly opposed to any rights for gay people its never shocking it is disappointing
4747009 strongly supports access to comprehensive affordable family planning services and age appropriate sex education
4747010 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4747011 what this does most importantly is to commit the democratic party to supply real support for the child for the woman facing this question
4747012 we pursue the art of the possible and if we move to protect even a single life weve done a good thing
4747013 people think that imposing these draconian retroactive laws are a way to keep their children safe
4747014 these laws dont provide public safety they only demonize a particular group
4747015 informing the public of a true fact is not considered punishment
4747016 weve objected since it was first introduced in the legislature
4747017 we believe its unconstitutional when its applied retroactively even going forward its bad policy
4747018 we used to have a system where a judge made a decision about an offenders risk to re offend
4747019 now its based only on the offense that theyre convicted of not on any future risk
4747020 remember its the offender who decided to go out and commit the crime that they did
4747021 this increases the standards and raises the level of accountability of those individuals who have been convicted of sex crimes and it raises the ability of law enforcement to further protect the community
4747022 i never touched my stepdaughter or any other child inappropriately

4747050 when i was in my 30s 50 just seemed so ancient to me
4747051 i was in high school when she hit it big
4747052 now that her first young fans are in their 30s we look at madonna as sort of a harbinger of the future for us and the future looks pretty good
4747053 is that aging is not the inevitability that we might have assumed by watching our fathers now in their 50s and 60s madonna is proof that exercising and eating right at an early age pays off
4747054 i want to know who her doctor is its really hard to believe shes 50 she looks 40 and she just keeps going at it living life and loving life
4747055 put a picture of a 50 year old woman today next to one from my mothers generation
4747056 we look at least 10 to 15 years younger than they did
4747057 also 50 really is a new beginning for so many women
4747058 many have accomplished a number of their goals already their children are getting older for the first time they can really think about themselves and ask what do i want from life
4747059 as the cliche goes i guess its better than the alternative
4747060 i just dont feel like what 50 should feel like
4747061 i remember my grandmother at 50 her hair was completely white my mother too was just at a very different place in her life than i am now
4747062 shes done a remarkable job of marketing herself and shes always been able to reinvent herself
4747063 im sure shes happy to be an inspiration to women and men of any age
4747064 is not quite the benchmark for her as it seems to be in the media who have been talking about her 50th since she turned 40

4747193 he is not a player we would want to lose at all but we have to be realistic about things
4747194 we will try to hang on to our players as best we can but there are bigger and stronger and much richer clubs than us around and i cant give full guarantees that no player will move that i want to keep
4747195 if clubs come calling and put ideas into players heads then you have to deal with it but luckily i am not in that situation
4747196 i have spoken to the club and they have told me they wont give me an extended contract so that gives me no option but to get my head down and play for fulham
4747197 i have got two years here and i love the lifestyle here and playing for fulham and lets get one thing straight i have always wanted to sign for fulham
4747198 hopefully the time will come when the club will extend my contract but at the moment im happy to be here

4747202 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4747203 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4747204 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4747205 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4747206 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4747207 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4747223 biggest overhaul of legislation on domestic violence in 30 years
4747224 there was a reduction in the number of applications and orders following july 2007 when the new measure was implemented but this reduction was more pronounced for orders than it was for applications the decreases are larger than in previous years
4747225 it must also be remembered that the dvcv act actually extended the availability of non molestation and occupation orders and hence we would expect to see an increase in orders granted and not a decrease overall
4747226 those engaged with the court process felt there had been a reduction in applications for non molestation orders and orders granted since july 2007 either due to both a reduction in the availability of legal aid and the criminalisation of breaches or because victims were concerned about potential imprisonment that follows a breach
4747227 although the government has made some important and effective strides in tackling domestic violence it is undermining its own efforts because the measures are isolated and unsupported as this study suggests however strong one initiative may be it will have a limited impact if its not inextricably linked across all areas of policy and so women at risk of violence will continue to fall through the gaps
4747228 government figures show the number of domestic violence cases being reported has increased the success rate on prosecuting domestic violence continues to improve
4747229 in 2007 both family and criminal jurisdictions of court helped 22 975 more victims than we did in 2004 this is a significant improvement against the background of an increasing volume of prosecutions this is a testament to the growing confidence victims have that they will be listened to and their reports effectively investigated coupled with the specialist and practical support victims receive
4747230 because the police and the cps have targets to meet what we also find is that when arrests are made perpetrators are only charged if the cps considers it a case that is likely to be successfully prosecuted and this leads to offences often being downgraded or dropped altogether
4747231 inflation in the construction industry has approximately doubled in recent years this is the main reason for the change in cost estimates
4747232 we have made significant improvements to the way we estimate the costs of planned road schemes
4747233 it would be much harder to make a case for these road projects using the bill they have left us with now
4747234 if the estimates had been anywhere near the latest revised figure it is questionable whether the schemes would have got the go ahead
4747235 it is very convenient for the government that these wildly inaccurate cost estimates happened to be low enough to get the road schemes to pass the benefit cost analysis
4747236 before even more taxpayers money is thrown down the drain
4747237 i have a brief recollection of giving someone some cash
4747238 my assumption is i loaned some small amount of money to both of them
4747239 i do i dont see any other explanation she would not have a child with someone she doesnt love and she loves him
4747240 lying regardless of who engages in it rebounds to the detriment of the party that asks people to believe they can do better
4747241 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated
4747242 we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take
4747243 we agreed at the security organ that the agreement should be signed within the period of the summit
4747244 all the parties appear to be agreeable to reaching an agreement this weekend but its a wait and see situation

4747251 its important because its our way of respecting the dead
4747252 it is also a chance for the whole family from across the country to come together
4747253 ive seen enough snow in my life i never want to be cold again
4747254 he was a loveable lad who was never really in trouble
4747255 he was respectful but there had been trouble at this party
4747256 someone told me that connor was thought to have said something to someone which he denied it all then got out of hand and there was a commotion and he ended up getting stabbed
4747257 he wasnt the sort of lad who would look for trouble but he would back himself up
4747258 just listen to the music and watch where you flick that tango heel
4747259 there are a lot of notions that this is the way college has to be this is the way ive planned on it to be my whole life
4747260 some people are quite vulnerable to depression but it doesnt emerge until the highly stressful years of separation and trying to grow into adulthood
4747261 kids with depression and anxiety disorders should be able to succeed with good treatment
4747262 i think its harder but it shouldnt be a block to their being successful
4747263 i really enjoy this occasion because this marks the love between a brother and sister it s basically a bond that ties us
4747264 an explosive vehicle in central balad went off last night killing nine civilians and injuring 40 others

4747266 they have hit a difficult patch but are still together things have been a bit rocky for them but he hasnt dumped her
4747267 the birth of the brangelina twins has got her down it has made her question where she should be in life at her age
4747268 it is really a cooling off not this big dramatic breakup
4747269 these are mature people who talk about things maturely its just slowed down
4747270 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4747271 we had made these arrangements for this round of negotiations before the conflict in georgia and so we just merely continued with the schedule we had
4747272 we believe that missile defense is a substantial contribution to natos collective security
4747273 the moment that initiated the current hostilities was the georgian invasion of south ossetia
4747274 imagine that we had been forced into military action on the side of georgia as a nato member on the side of an obvious gambler as one must describe saakashvili
4747275 i think little of demonizing russia and i believe moscow will soon see the need for greater integration into the international community
4747276 the uniqueness of our program is that we not only embrace eastern and western philosophies but we try to integrate the traditions of new mexico
4747277 keeping the body in balance staying healthy exercising eating healthy and doing good things in your life

4747280 chicago cbs senator barack obama is coming back home today after a weeks vacation with his family
4747281 going into this we knew there would be only one champion
4747282 we have both wanted it so bad that weve pushed each other so much and i think that we became a better and a stronger gymnast because of each other
4747283 i think if it had just been one of us there wouldnt be someone chasing your tail and wanting to make you work even harder
4747284 of course we knew one would win and one would be second
4747285 i think we did prove that we are very strong we had a few little mistakes in two days its tough but 1 2 is not by accident i think we are very strong in gymnastics and there is more to come
4747286 we kind of have been going back and forth the entire year and knew it would come down to the final competition and it came down to our final event
4747287 i am very very proud of both of the girls
4747288 they raised the standard of womens gymnastics even higher today
4747289 both my parents have been a big influence on me
4747290 my dad is with me in the gym every day and he is the reason why i am an olympic champion
4747291 to know that he was so close to that and didnt quite achieve it i hope i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him
4747292 i am so proud of the way our guys played today kept fighting kept coming back all the different things that occurred today truly what im looking for i cant ask for anything more out of the position players the pitchers whomever its exactly what were looking for here and beyond everything else the continuous maximum effort was tremendous
4747293 we believe that as long as were on that field weve got a chance to win that ballgame
4747294 i just think its us believing in ourselves no matter who we have in the field and go out there and doing it
4747295 dan yang paling kurang ialah di perlis iaitu tolak enam peratus

4747299 this is more devastating news for indianas working families and it further illustrates the need for a new direction and new leadership in this state month after month indiana continues to lose good paying jobs while this administration does little if anything to stop it i firmly believe that with the right leadership and right priorities we can turn this economy around i am running for governor because i want to work to rebuild this economy and make indiana more competitive by overhauling our tax structure reforming our health care and education systems and working to bring economic opportunity and good paying jobs back to every indiana community
4747300 im forever grateful to all my supportive friends and family
4747301 youve always helped me and i love you so much and how could i forget my awesome fans who will never be forgotten i love you all and thank you for making me um me
4747302 i am just delighted to be back i just want to be back doing what i do and thats living the life of a bullfighter
4747303 it is quite a selfish thing to do really i suppose to engage in this sort of activity out of caprice
4747304 i am sure that puts pressure on those who are near me and i am sorry that they have to put up with it but thats it
4747305 in every generation there is a chosen one one girl in all the world one born with the strength and skill to hunt the vampires
4747306 dovete catturare con una foto il vostro stato danimo ma non con la vostra faccia non con volti di persone con le cose
4747307 cortar el tr fico ferroviario con el oeste y con los puestos georgianos que permanecen ocupados
4747308 ahora estamos en tiempos de paz por qu bamos a volar puentes cuando tenemos que restablecerlos
4747309 no member of the government has ever explained why they are there this is because they do not know and also because they dont have the courage to admit they have made a foolish mistake
4747310 all the arguments they put forward are false or absurd it is not about stamping out terrorist bases
4747311 even if we had the troops to do this such bases might just as easily be in pakistan where we cannot send soldiers
4747312 or they could be in west yorkshire thanks to our immigration policies where our vaunted security services probably couldnt find them
4747313 it is not about defeating the taliban the men we make deals with as tribal elders one week are the taliban a few days later when they ambush our troops
4747314 it is not about bringing democracy and freedom to afghanistan this noble objective is a joke in a country run by tribal chieftains whose elected president barely has control over his own bedroom let alone his capital and certainly not his country
4747315 finally it is pitiful beyond the point of embarrassment that a country which cannot control disorder on its own streets should be posing as a global constable in a part of the world from which we have already been violently expelled twice and where we have no business
4747316 o povo abre o caminho mas n o fica com o poder essa consci ncia se espalha e cria d vidas questionamentos o lado imprevis vel do povo pode romper de forma ca tica

4747320 para mim a melhor t tica seria que eles sempre sacassem para fora mas como isso n o poss vel acho que prefiro quando eles variam mais assim ningu m sai do jogo
4747321 como meu t cnico diz um jogo de gato e rato o mais malandro vai vencer
4747322 jogos assim s o importantes para vermos que todos que est o aqui s o fortes n o davam nada para o jap o e eles quase venceram o primeiro set vai saber o que fariam se estivessem em vantagem por isso bom levar uns sustos para mim foi bom sair um pouco s do levantamento mecanizar um pouco o ataque que vai ser importante nas pr ximas partidas
4747323 o presidente informou aos participantes do conselho de seguran a da r ssia que havia acabado de assinar o plano de seis pontos

4747329 you cant connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future you have to trust in something your gut destiny life karma whatever this approach has never let me down and it has made all the difference in my life
4747330 sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick dont lose faith im convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that i loved what i did youve got to find what you love and that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers your work is going to fill a large part of your life and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work and the only way to do great work is to love what you do if you havent found it yet keep looking dont settle as with all matters of the heart youll know when you find it and like any great relationship it just gets better and better as the years roll on so keep looking until you find it dont settle
4747331 remembering that you are going to die is the best way i know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose you are already naked there is no reason not to follow your heart
4747332 your time is limited so dont waste it living someone elses life dont be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other peoples thinking dont let the noise of others opinions drown out your own inner voice and most important have the courage to follow your heart and intuition they somehow already know what you truly want to become everything else is secondary

4747342 its the opportunity to pitch a couple of times before the end of the season
4747343 were pushing for a major league opportunity an affiliated opportunity he obviously needs to pitch
4747344 too many people trying to tinker with his mechanics and not let kyle jackson be the pitcher he is and he had too many roles it was just difficult
4747345 hes a local kid and we made every attempt to get him into a pride uniform we wish him the best
4747346 he was the first person to call me asking about jacksons availability
4747347 the red sox organization is stacked for him to be on the 40 man roster for two years is quite an accomplishment

4747351 uncomfortable but looks funny and will get laughs so ill wear it anyway
4747352 some teams have also raised questions about the timing of the competition in pakistan when muslims the world over fast in the holy month of ramazan
4747353 the truth is that even within the pcb there is a sinking feeling of a losing battle and they are expecting the worst in the next few days
4747354 if the icc manages to convince the teams that champions trophy should be held in pakistan then it would be a major achievement but at the moment most of the teams are in the comfortable position of defending themselves by pointing out that the travel advisories to them by their foreign office does not encourage traveling to pakistan
4747355 i dont understand this given the critical situation when the icc task force was in pakistan the chairman was not in the country then why send coach geoff lawson to australia and new zealand when already in the past even the australians were not convinced by his arguments about playing in pakistan

4747394 i will gift a poor couple with a free overnight and make them feel pampered by gods love
4747395 the latest was a couple the woman was very happy with our palitaw and said it resolved a rift with her partner
4747396 since the introduction of video and computer games concerns have been raised regarding their possible ill effects
4747397 from one angle or another however luther returned again and again to the question of the meaning of being human
4747398 we all knew we needed this game and we get down 4 0
4747399 we got a little fire in our belly and the coaches got after us after the first couple innings because we werent having good at bats
4747400 the biggest thing is when someone says you cant do things when people say its impossible to tie or break these records i proved anythings possible
4747401 if you put in the hard work and put your mind to it anythings possible
4747402 we all knew we needed this game and we get down 4 0
4747403 we got a little fire in our belly and the coaches got after us after the first couple innings because we werent having good at bats

4747407 if you put in the hard work and put your mind to it anythings possible
4747408 that is a lack of respect on the part of the u s manager to say that
4747409 the cuban team is very professional we respect the game and our opponents we are incapable of doing that
4747410 the biggest thing is when someone says you cant do things when people say its impossible to tie or break these records i proved anythings possible

4747414 ms beck at this time we dont know who our presidential nominee will be
4747415 look save your breath i will no longer contribute to the rnc since they support candidates that i do not support
4747416 at this important time in history more then ever we conservatives need to come together to prevent liberals like hillary clinton and barak obama from becoming president
4747417 why so the rnc can put a liberal like john mccain in the presidency instead
4747418 the republicans had the house senate and white house for 6 years and instead of getting some conservative solutions for our pressing problems like social security reform our
4747419 well you dont want the democrats in office do you if people like you wont support the rnc then thats what will happen
4747420 well i cant afford to send you money i need it to pay for my tax increase which is inevitable since mccain is against the bush tax cuts too
4747421 good thing because i wont be volunteering this year and i suspect most of the people who worked with me on the bush campaign wont either
4747422 but a republican is better than a democrat in office
4747423 thats debatable i refuse to have my money going to liberal republicans in the future i am sending my money directly to the candidates of my choice or to freedom watch or citizens united
4747424 but the rnc is the only organization which by law can advertise 60 days before an election

4747431 last night he was there at the village we had a video meeting talked about the game plan and to be honest i thought it may be a little stranger but it kind of felt like we didnt skip a beat
4747432 i wouldve been quite happy to get on the plane with them but we had some unfinished business here
4747433 she was extremely encouraging she was adamant that i stay she assured me shes going to be good weve had a week here to grieve together and ive been trying to do my best to help her through this very difficult process but shes a strong woman and shes in a good place right now to be with her family and to get on with the next phase of this thing
4747434 i actually went over to the new zealand part of the village last night just to say thanks

4747469 the visitor numbers for tracey emins retrospective have been excellent and by far the best we have had for an exhibition in the national gallery of modern art during the festival
4747470 there has been a very broad range of people coming along to the show as well which is really encouraging and on the whole people have been impressed
4747471 there has been a mixed reaction from some which you might expect a lot of people have come along because so much has been said about emins work that they maybe want to see for themselves what it is about and that is very encouraging
4747472 she also has a lot of very devoted fans who have travelled up in their droves to see the show tracey is currently taking a break after all the work she put into the show but i know shell be very pleased by the response

4747477 he was fishing in the cumberland river close to home as a boy with a home made pole and line the line he described as similar to twine as we know it today he caught and landed a fish he guessed to be around ten pounds a largemouth bass after fishing he started off toward pineville walking with his prize fish as he neared the town a man a name i cant remember stopped him and asked him about the fish where he caught it and what he caught it on after hoot told him the details the man offered him 10 for the fish and to not tell a soul that he caught the fish hoot agreed and handed him the fish for the 10 they proceeded into pineville where the man claimed to a gathering crowd of admirers that he caught the fish with all the flourish and story told him by hoot hoot took the 10 a fortune during those depression days to the local hardware store where he bought a new rod reel and line the first that he ever owned

4747565 o metr de superf cie mais confort vel mas enfrenta os mesmos problemas de tr nsito e como qualquer nibus fica preso nos engarrafamento em botafogo e no jardim bot nico sem falar que nos hor rios de pico o embarque mais demorado nos pontos e a gente enfrenta a maior fila com o metr de verdade at valeria a pena pagar mais pela passagem
4747566 em quase 30 anos o que a gente v o metr avan ando na velocidade de uma charrete j viajei bastante para o exterior e nunca vi nibus sendo chamado de metr isso mais fruto do jeitinho brasileiro das coisas que deveriam ser provis rias mas que quando a gente v j est o incorporada como definitivo o metr de superf cie uma esp cie de cpmf do transporte
4747567 tenho a impress o que estou vivendo na idade de pedra em que o metr n o anda p ra

4747601 how many times has copy protection prevented you playing a game
4747602 were not seeing the thousands the hundreds who streamed through in the past
4747603 cest une des pistes voqu es loin d tre finalis e et dont il faut encore d cider du mode de fonctionnement
4747604 it shows that no matter what you set your mind to anything can happen
4747605 i saw so many quotes saying its impossible to duplicate that it wont happen but bob bowman phelps coach is the one who helped me to really dream about anything bob and i have gone through a lot together and its all paid off
4747606 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4747607 we didnt want them to go to sleep feeling like something was lost and they didnt have a chance
4747608 although the rules dont allow for team officials to watch video footage we did give them the opportunity to see for themselves after the competition the serbian team was very satisfied and agreed with the decision by the referee
4747609 when i did chop that last stroke i really though it cost me the race
4747610 i ended up making the right decision trying to take a short fast stroke to try to get my hand on the wall first turned out to be in my favor
4747611 in that situation its the lesser of two evils either youre going to glide or take half a stroke
4747612 he did a much better job taking half a stroke
4747613 one one hundreth of a second is the smallest margin of victory in our sport
4747614 its a complete miracle to me that i am here
4747615 i retired a year and a half ago so im enjoying this moment from my heart i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish im not angry at all
4747616 bringing arab forces in the frame of resolving the disgraceful situation in gaza to end the coup is a possible and viable idea
4747617 fatah is open to any proposal to end the coup
4747618 this summit affords us the possibility to assist the zimbabwean parties to finalise their negotiations so that together they can engage the work to achieve national healing and reconciliation
4747619 attend to the matter of reconstruction and development of zimbabwe and in this way extricate the masses of the people from the dire straits in which they find themselves
4747620 im certain that the millions of zimbabweans both inside and outside zimbabwe await with great expectations and high hopes a positive outcome from our deliberations
4747621 at this rate reconstruction will last 10 years and a generation of our citizens of our children will be raised in inequality because they live in huts and have nowhere to study
4747622 russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
4747623 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4747624 i would say that hes not completely out of the picture still
4747625 hes a fugitive and hes probably seeking refugee status and the thai attorney general would have to prove hes not a refugee and he doesnt deserve to have refugee status and that will be a legal process that will become a political issue in the near future
4747626 well indeed escape to england this time has turned thaksin into a political martyr which will serve to maintain the strength of his party
4747627 my guess is that the samak government will survive for quite a long time much longer than many people suspect
4747628 there is no god but allah indian forces go back
4747629 two isaf service members died as a result of wounds suffered during an ied strike and small arms fire attack on their patrol in eastern afghanistan today
4747630 the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe has as its aim the russian federation
4747631 the moment has been chosen well and therefore any fairy tales about deterring other states fairy tales that with the help of this system we will deter some sort of rogue states no longer work
4747632 this is no longer 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia when a great power invaded a small neighbor and overthrew its government
4747633 unfortunately after what has happened it is unlikely that the ossetians and the abkhazians will be able to live in one state together with the georgians
4747634 with its actions in recent days russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
4747635 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4747636 poland by deploying the radar is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4747637 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4747638 and this evil is very strong very nasty and very dangerous for all of us
4747639 weve had high level contact with the leaders of russia secretary rice has spoken to her counterparts
4747640 there will be an appropriate time to have additional high level contacts with the russians
4747641 it might be in the long term you would have less possibility to influence russia
4747642 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west
4747643 the united states has supported those efforts now russia has put its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
4747644 its harder to get a couple to move from a big home to such a small unit
4747645 because of that a number of the smaller units have become obsolete
4747646 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated
4747647 we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take
4747648 i thought it was wonderful i would recommend it to anyone
4747649 its fantastic because its about how serious wine is for this town its a sonoma film
4747650 if you are a real sonoman you are here tonight we are all real sonomans here
4747651 to have the movie play here is the most magical part of it all
4747652 i feel so proud that so many extras so many people with small speaking parts came out here to support us tonight
4747653 she needs to fulfill the agreement of contracts signed on her behalf so programs can be reopened
4747654 this ad is just more of the same old false and discredited attacks that senator mccain knows arent true
4747655 can execute its nuclear mission in a safe secure and reliable manner
4747656 that is in line with our long held view that the dollar will trend higher as growth and interest rate differentials move in the u s dollars favor
4747657 im not looking for any new job im running for re election
4747658 if i was bi lingual id say no in multiple languages the only job john kerry is running for contemplating or considering is the one he already has
4747659 lack of support for mental illness is part of a total lifelong family denial of what
4747660 the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe has the russian federation as its aim
4747661 was signed at a time of a very difficult crisis in relations between russia and the us over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4747662 lack of support for mental illness is part of a total lifelong family denial of what
4747663 dream as big as you can dream and anything is possible
4747664 i am sort of in a dream world sometimes i have to pinch myself to make sure it is real
4747665 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4747666 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4747667 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4747668 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4747669 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4747670 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4747671 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4747672 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4747673 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4747674 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
4747675 im even more shocked now than i was then one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
4747676 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4747677 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4747678 i wasnt going to at first then i was saying to myself this race is going to be very tight and im going to use everything i got so i put it out there
4747679 i always welcome comments it definitely motivates me even more
4747680 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming
4747681 i am sure bob and i can think of some more goals in the next four years
4747682 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4747683 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4747684 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4747685 every time you race phelps youll have a great race and a great time just hearing his arms slap on the block gets your heart racing hes amazing
4747686 lack of support for mental illness is part of a total lifelong family denial of what
4747687 without giving enough time for the defendants to hire a defense lawyer
4747688 heres a woman thats successful takes care of herself looks amazing and she took the steps to get there it doesnt happen unless you take charge shes a great role model for many many women
4747689 when i was in my 30s 50 just seemed so ancient to me
4747690 i was in high school when she hit it big
4747691 now that her first young fans are in their 30s we look at madonna as sort of a harbinger of the future for us and the future looks pretty good
4747692 is that aging is not the inevitability that we might have assumed by watching our fathers now in their 50s and 60s madonna is proof that exercising and eating right at an early age pays off
4747693 i want to know who her doctor is its really hard to believe shes 50 she looks 40 and she just keeps going at it living life and loving life
4747694 put a picture of a 50 year old woman today next to one from my mothers generation
4747695 we look at least 10 to 15 years younger than they did
4747696 also 50 really is a new beginning for so many women
4747697 many have accomplished a number of their goals already their children are getting older for the first time they can really think about themselves and ask what do i want from life
4747698 film which appealed to older women because of its portrayal of the late 40s and 50s as a still sexy time of life
4747699 as the cliche goes i guess its better than the alternative
4747700 i just dont feel like what 50 should feel like
4747701 i remember my grandmother at 50 her hair was completely white my mother too was just at a very different place in her life than i am now
4747702 shes done a remarkable job of marketing herself and shes always been able to reinvent herself
4747703 this summit affords us the possibility to assist the zimbabwean parties to finalise their negotiations so that together they can engage the work to achieve national healing and reconciliation
4747704 attend to the matter of reconstruction and development of zimbabwe and in this way extricate the masses of the people from the dire straits in which they find themselves
4747705 im certain that the millions of zimbabweans both inside and outside zimbabwe await with great expectations and high hopes a positive outcome from our deliberations
4747706 es gibt keinen anlass zu jubilieren und jetzt die rmel wieder runterzukrempeln
4747707 der start l sst hoffen dass wir den abw rtstrend stoppen k nnen
4747708 ich denke auch im schwimmen haben sich einige erwartungen nicht erf llt
4747709 wenn es deutsche talente gibt werden wir sie auch in diesen disziplinen f rdern
4747710 die ergebnisse von peking haben gezeigt dass es richtig ist niemanden ohne endkampf chance zu nominieren
4747711 there is no god but allah indian forces go back
4747712 people have given their verdict that they wont tolerate oppression and injustice it is time for new delhi to act and solve the dispute
4747713 the key to change is to let go of fear
4747714 no member of the government has ever explained why they are there this is because they do not know and also because they dont have the courage to admit they have made a foolish mistake
4747715 all the arguments they put forward are false or absurd it is not about stamping out terrorist bases
4747716 even if we had the troops to do this such bases might just as easily be in pakistan where we cannot send soldiers
4747717 or they could be in west yorkshire thanks to our immigration policies where our vaunted security services probably couldnt find them
4747718 it is not about defeating the taliban the men we make deals with as tribal elders one week are the taliban a few days later when they ambush our troops
4747719 it is not about bringing democracy and freedom to afghanistan this noble objective is a joke in a country run by tribal chieftains whose elected president barely has control over his own bedroom let alone his capital and certainly not his country
4747720 finally it is pitiful beyond the point of embarrassment that a country which cannot control disorder on its own streets should be posing as a global constable in a part of the world from which we have already been violently expelled twice and where we have no business
4747721 when this opportunity came to renew beaulieus involvement with the rug business i jumped at it
4747722 i have very passionate feelings for this business and this company
4747723 we do not have weaving facilities in north america but the parent company in belgium has extensive weaving capacity
4747724 we rolled out our new initiative to sell more pillows across canada in the second quarter and are pleased with its early success and the fact that we can now offer our customers a complete sleep system
4747725 the bankruptcy case was filed for one reason to liquidate property in which heller holds a first priority lean
4747726 douglas is no longer operating and all that remains to be accomplished is the collection of accounts receivable there are no other significant assets and minimal prospects for sale
4747727 the value of the assets will not approach the total secured debt owed to heller and the lenders in either a going concern sale or a liquidation
4747728 i wanted to get people talking about the problem of fabric waste
4747729 the mission is to find ways to reduce reuse and recycle and the gifft program is a huge step forward
4747730 weve targeted the furniture industry and fabric manufacturers it can be open to whoever wants to drop off fabric the goal is to ship at least a half a truckload full from each site
4747731 if furniture companies want to donate a warehouse site we will add another collection site

4747734 we were living in a renovated home downtown when i asked my husband if hed like to take a sunday drive and see where i grew up
4747735 this is the only place i ever found myself at home
4747736 we feel fortunate to be here because its so beyond what we thought we could ever have
4747737 we feel more like the stewards of this place than the owners the property allows us to take care of it

4747750 heres a woman thats successful takes care of herself looks amazing and she took the steps to get there it doesnt happen unless you take charge shes a great role model for many many women
4747751 when i was in my 30s 50 just seemed so ancient to me
4747752 i was in high school when she hit it big
4747753 now that her first young fans are in their 30s we look at madonna as sort of a harbinger of the future for us and the future looks pretty good

4747763 shes done a remarkable job of marketing herself and shes always been able to reinvent herself
4747764 im sure shes happy to be an inspiration to women and men of any age
4747765 is not quite the benchmark for her as it seems to be in the media who have been talking about her 50th since she turned 40
4747766 as a result of our cost reduction efforts we began to see positive bottom line results at the end of the second quarter
4747767 we remain confident in our ability to manage the business through these challenging times
4747768 shall be dedicated to expanding the market for mattresses enhancing customer relations and facilitating efforts among mattress retailers manufacturers and component suppliers to improve the consumers mattress buying experience the mattress retailer council will provide ispa with a forum for the mattress retail sector to discuss significant opportunities and challenges facing the mattress industry
4747769 by bringing together retailers manufacturers and their suppliers we are well positioned to achieve our goal of expanding the market for mattress sales
4747770 while ispa remains a manufacturer focused organization this new council provides an excellent opportunity for us to collectively work together to the benefit of the entire industry
4747771 we will fully support the break up frankly it is about time
4747772 i am touched by the support this is an overwhelming support

4747777 we had no way we could find out whether the potential bidders had the funds or funding for a proposed purchase

4747779 it was pretty tough theres an enormous amount of snow
4747780 we kept having to dig the tent out itd just get buried we couldve suffocated so one would have to get out and dig it out and then try and get back in and keep warm everythings soaking wet
4747781 the ineffable joy that can be had in pursuing the absurd
4747782 my head was so full of words that i often had trouble forming simple sentences out loud
4747783 and my speech became a curious jumble of obscure words and improper syntax
4747784 some days i feel as if i do not actually speak the english language
4747785 like trying to remember all the trees one sees through the window of a train
4747786 i find myself wondering why ive never seen this odd term that describes such a common article of clothing

4747809 we are going middle to promotional because we cant go to the high end any more
4747810 it is tough to sell to the higher end anymore because people are holding on to their money people are looking for more value more bang for their buck
4747811 but we are ok because we are on the lower to mid end of the market we move with the times and we are more flexible than other people
4747812 you can watch bad news every day but you have to be proactive and optimistic about it and weather the storm until it gets better

4747816 with a quick three to four day delivery from the receipt of the order
4747817 in todays economic situation the retailer doesnt have to have nearly as heavy an inventory order
4747818 you have got to go about your business and lean it down the best way you can
4747819 you have to continue to build relationships with key customers and count on those relationships surviving as business gets tougher and tougher
4747820 everybody is experiencing a rollercoaster because for a few days it is good and three days later it is bad but it is pretty soft overall
4747821 what we are doing is to look at different products to branch out with trying different things and giving different incentives when we are putting packages together
4747822 we are working harder for less but everybody else is having to do that as well
4747823 i have always been told that it is tough to stay at one point you either fall back or you grow and we are definitely interested in growing
4747824 for me this is an important market for retail customers
4747825 you have to go in with the right attitude and the right mix
4747826 we have a large warehouse in houston and everything that is in the catalog is available here
4747827 truckload pricing is an advantage over buying it out of a warehouse you can save anywhere from 12 to 18 we own it and you dont have to buy the container and you can buy it when you need it
4747828 the investment that our parent company reed business information has made to enhance our already powerful web site will pay dividends for our readers by allowing them to access even more news and information than ever before
4747829 since debuting the industrys first electronic daily news dispatch in 2000 with our e daily weve constantly looked for better ways to give our audience enhanced content on demand and our redesigned web site marks another major step in that direction
4747830 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4747831 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4747832 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4747833 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4747834 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4747835 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4747836 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4747837 the only apparent casuality of her actions was a million detonated nerve endings in a thousand anonymous men
4747838 were going to have a lot of the basics on the menu some really nice salads at lunchtime thai chicken salad and shrimp salads

4747841 expect to find 20 big screen tvs a draft beer system featuring at least 15 to 20 specialty drafts and local brews as well as a radio transmission area where golic can do live broadcasts
4747842 it wasnt really part of our thought process going in because thats just unneeded pressure
4747843 we are very excited about marrying our domestic capabilities with the knowledge and expertise that magnussen has gained in asia over the past 27 years
4747844 together we are bringing a superior product to the marketplace
4747845 magnussen home is excited to work with worldwide logistics to manage the supply chain and thereby bring about a greater number of turns and reductions in inventory for our retailers and suppliers

4747861 exacerbating the situation is a tightening in credit markets for consumers as well as in the real estate market both of which have direct effects on demands for the companys goods and services finally economic indicators suggest that demand for non essential durable goods orders is declining given all these factors management is anticipating that it will be difficult to maintain sales in the quarters ahead

4747869 there was no way i could stand in the sun any longer
4747870 we were led to believe that together with the u s we could stand up to the russians it turned out to be an illusion

4747921 we are thrilled with this new association and have long respected ruggieros upholstery designs and fabric collection for sunbrella
4747922 we see many opportunities with our two companies working together now and in the future miles talbott and our parent company michael thomas have used ruggieros fabrics for many years and have been very pleased with their performance and design
4747923 both revenue and net income for the first six months of the year were the highest in company history
4747924 considering the difficult north american economic environment and the continuing negativity around consumer spending habits all three of our business segments have performed extraordinarily well
4747925 our home furnishings products feature exceptional value at reasonable prices as consumers seek the most for their dollar clearly there is continued strong demand for dorels products
4747926 both we and our retail customer base were concerned about the impact of higher retail prices on the consumer however from what we have seen thus far for the most part demand at the retail level has not been hurt by the higher price points now in stores
4747927 in fact demand for domestically produced product has risen dramatically allowing the segments north american factories to run much more efficiently
4747928 in addition to the broad initiatives of domestic manufacturing consolidation and international expansion that we have previously outlined we are also focused on the day to day aspects of our business that affect profitability
4747929 merchandise produced by an entity with a high margin which is purchased through a different exporter should not be imported into the united states at the lower cash deposit rate moreover the application of the combination rates is consistent with the departments regulations
4747930 bonnie has spent more than 25 years building prestige retail formats around the world like holt renfrew lane crawford harvey nichols and leading designer brand stand alone stores in asia
4747931 her retail acumen will assist her as she elevates the bay to a new position within the canadian retail landscape one in which the bay will be a premiere department store experience with better brands and service
4747932 the role to transform the bay from its existing format to world class was too compelling to pass up
4747933 he is a seasoned merchant who has helped to grow some of canadas most beloved retail formats mark has first hand experience working in almost every role within a large scale retail organization that depth of knowledge will be an asset to hbc as we move forward with our plan to drive top line growth at zellers and re energize the brand

4747940 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4747941 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4747942 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4747943 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4747944 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4747945 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4747946 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4747947 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4747948 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4747949 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4747950 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4747951 across the board in price points some we have talked with in the higher end have noted that they have not seen that end of the market hit this hard in recent memory
4747952 we have talked to a few manufacturers and distributors who have noted a bit of an uptick in orders recently
4747953 ges retail and restructuring expertise was critical in securing financing because they truly understood our business and the challenges we were working to overcome
4747954 we also valued their ability to make significant financial commitment in an uncertain market environment
4747955 the economic environment we operated in during the second quarter was very difficult because of reduced demand and increased costs
4747956 despite the difficult environment our products continue to be among the best performing at retail
4747957 despite the cost savings operational and merchandising improvements boscovs has put in place over the last few months a great workforce and loyal customers the downturn in the economy and consumer spending along with the serious credit market crunch have put severe pressure on our companys financial position
4747958 capitalize and build upon the core competencies of uniters stainsafe and multimaster and will be the leading force in the furniture care and protection business
4747959 by bringing together and building upon the best of stainsafe multimaster and uniters global care solutions will provide customers and consumers with outstanding top quality solutions to effectively address their home care related needs
4747960 providing great products and programs and outstanding customer service is how to win in this tough economic market and that is exactly what global care solutions is now set up to do
4747961 the current economic conditions which have had a brutal impact on the residential furniture industry show few signs of abating in the near term
4747962 our focus is on cost containment and maintaining our strong balance sheet while enhancing our competitive positions in the markets we serve
4747963 we are currently analyzing additional reductions in our sg amp a fixed costs given the severity and protracted nature of this business cycle
4747964 in light of current economic conditions and continued softness in the retail mattress environment we determined that closing this plant is the best decision for the company
4747965 we remain focused on managing those areas of our business that we can control and we are better aligning capacity to meet our current manufacturing needs
4747966 we regret that this decision will impact a number of sealy employees this action is part of our strategic plan that includes streamlining our cost structure to become a leaner organization i am confident that these actions will help position sealy for even stronger growth potential over the long term
4747967 and our written business was way up over last market
4747968 there were fewer east coast dealers but this market was better than we expected
4747969 people came to this market with a good attitude and we like that
4747970 our business is strong and our youth program is on fire
4747971 this project is the manifest destiny of the home furnishings industry
4747972 there are a lot of people who came here to change their business and i think weve given them the tools to do that
4747973 what blew me away is to look out on this campus and realize that is has been just three years since the first market was held here
4747974 this was our best vegas market to date both in terms of attendance and orders
4747975 i think it was the combined results of our new showroom our new trucking program and our heavy push of introductions across all our major categories
4747976 our average order was up and our actual written business was consistent with the last two markets here
4747977 we saw lighter attendance from our east coast dealers this time than we did in january
4747978 in our case we debuted three new lines of leather upholstery new dining collections a completely new line of visco bedding a new line of inner spring bedding and a new assortment of micro fiber upholstered goods that gave us a story to tell and our dealers were listening
4747979 as our first show it was good obviously we expect more in february
4747980 with certain styles of upholstery you just cant get everything out of china
4747981 in terms of upholstery made in the usa is coming back
4747982 our business is based solely on the honest evaluation of the merchandise we service
4747983 our service eliminates the guesswork and perception issues that the consumer may have after the delivery
4747984 we can flow back information after we have completed enough inspections to the retailer or manufacturer
4747985 we can share the results of how the merchandise performs in the consumers home we get to see the problems as they are happening
4747986 i was in charge of hiring and recruiting craftspeople to perform the in home services
4747987 you can imagine how difficult it was to find the right individuals who could do upholstery repairs and wood furniture repairs but the one thing they could all do equally well was a mattress inspection thats when i first thought about building a business to do nothing but inspect sleep sets
4747988 the biggest thing is when someone says you cant do things when people say its impossible to tie or break these records i proved anythings possible
4747989 if you put in the hard work and put your mind to it anythings possible
4747990 that is a lack of respect on the part of the u s manager to say that
4747991 the cuban team is very professional we respect the game and our opponents we are incapable of doing that
4747992 the biggest thing is when someone says you cant do things when people say its impossible to tie or break these records i proved anythings possible
4747993 if you put in the hard work and put your mind to it anythings possible
4747994 that is a lack of respect on the part of the u s manager to say that
4747995 the cuban team is very professional we respect the game and our opponents we are incapable of doing that

4747997 hey dummy i need to use the toilet and my kitty litter is in the laundry so open the door
4747998 since you are not interested in the facts i wont waste my time sharing them here but please know that when the consumer is presented the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth as to why the consumer product safety commission put these ridiculous rules in place they dont want a safe mattress
4747999 unfortunately ispa does not have a true grasp on what is happening with the industry on a timely basis however without the majors providing accurate information it is difficult to see how they can even closely approximate what is happening which begs the question of why even publish such a report
4748000 my personal belief is that survival is not a given for many if their only plan is to hold on and wait for a better economy
4748001 the unprecedented price increases our industry is getting on raw materials coupled with all the other problems faced by our customers and consumers this is turning out to be the most difficult year i have ever seen in the mattress business what does your crystal ball show
4748002 tri publica o sobre o mesmo assunto aqui fica um coment rio que foi apagado num dos outros posts sobre os nouvelle vague

4748006 in addition we are introducing a new lower priced segment to broaden the appeal of our products so that younger consumers can begin to enjoy the benefits of the brand
4748007 while our retailers will continue to sell direct having our own showrooms in high traffic areas internationally will expose the brand to more consumers
4748008 magniflexs worldwide showrooms allow consumers to browse try and test our products we remain committed to our retailers carrying the magniflex brand as the fastest growth still comes from our dealers

4748013 when retailers came in here their faces lit up they were very pleasantly surprised by what we have done
4748014 we are very excited and enthused by the reaction to what weve done here
4748015 traffic in july is always a little lower than in january but all the big guys were here and they did visit our space
4748016 those retailers who did come are looking for ideas to build business and weather the storm
4748017 the feedback we are getting is that attendance overall is disappointing
4748018 but you can see that there are fewer people here
4748019 the right people came in those were retailers we wouldnt have seen otherwise
4748020 the new structure is based on the principles of efficiency and efficacy and its goal is to bring us increasingly closer to consumers throughout the world
4748021 the relaunch of our business begins with making the most of the company assets the focus on the natuzzi and italsofa brands and the strategic entry to certain key markets that will aid growth
4748022 this new philosophy calls for great commitment cultural change and dedication from the groups management and employees to meet the new challenges

4748027 i have been fortunate to work for stanley furniture for 32 years
4748028 it has been a wonderful career experience i now look forward to moving on to the next opportunity in my life
4748029 we are making a number of moves to keep our company profitable and competitive
4748030 no mattress is an entirely sustainable product but we have developed a line of mattresses that are absolutely less harmful to the environment than a traditional foam mattress and the environmentally conscious consumer will appreciate that
4748031 the general poor state of the economy particularly the terribly troubled housing market
4748032 this was still not enough to offset the decline in sales and operating margins
4748033 it should be something that complements and enhances your way of life focusing on needs beyond simply being somewhere to sit eat and sleep for example to maximize peoples home theater experience we will carry merchandise like power reclining furniture for people who like to entertain we offer modular pieces that can be reconfigured easily for different occasions
4748034 we want to bring some excitement in colors to the retail floor
4748035 women purchase more than 80 of the upholstery in our industry so it made sense to take a cue from the colors that are currently hot in womens fashions
4748036 we believe it makes perfect sense to offer the same colors in sofas especially since women make the majority of upholstery purchases
4748037 instead they call for a break from the monotony of neutrals while giving a very compelling reason for the consumer to take furniture off her list of things to buy sometime in the future
4748038 for us the bottom line is that we are striving to move the consumer and the retailer emotionally and the only way to do that is through some bold and different means of presentation
4748039 those efforts have allowed our retail division to have a product development department second to none along with the capabilities to make almost any product one can imagine

4748058 englander is committed to a more environmentally responsible approach to operations including the use of renewable resource materials reduced energy consumption and recycling
4748059 i believe that our organic program is important because it is giving the consumer something that she wants legitimate organic mattresses
4748060 she can be confident that she has purchased a sleep set that is better for her and better for the environment
4748061 there are a lot of people who came here to change their business and i think weve given them the tools to do that
4748062 what blew me away is to look out on this campus and realize that is has been just three years since the first market was held here
4748063 like many exhibitors concerned about soft business and attendance at a summer market in vegas we held our breath but we began writing orders when the doors opened and weve been going ever since
4748064 we had an incredible first day with strong traffic to see our new mar a lago collection from trump home we couldnt be more pleased
4748065 we enjoyed brisk traffic early opening day and were getting a lot of play from our casual dining and upholstery offerings
4748066 weve already had lots of buyers in including a strong showing of international buyers
4748067 consumers assessment of current conditions was little changed suggesting there has been no significant improvement nor significant deterioration in business or labor market conditions
4748068 looking ahead while consumers remain extremely grim about short term prospects the modest improvement in expectations often a harbinger of economic times to come bears careful watching over the next few months
4748069 as the eco bedding category grows natura is the national brand that has created a one stop shop for retailers
4748070 were committed to delivering the finest quality natural solutions for better sleep for every bedroom in the home
4748071 this is the final step to take in providing customers and their families with all natural safe products they want in their homes
4748072 each individual of this team has significant career experience in the furniture industry and all have excelled in the management of our company over the last several years
4748073 these promotions recognize their individual contributions and establish our management team for the dramatic growth of our business that lies ahead
4748074 we know this is a war between the west and russia
4748075 if he fails to decide to quit within the next two days the impeachment process will take its course

4748080 practice fusion understands the two major barriers for practices to adopt new technology are cost and implementation solutions should not cost a years revenues and require consultants onsite for long drawn out installations
4748081 forget everything you know about software practice fusions exclusive live in five program allows you to be up and charting in less than five minutes there are no sales contracts no consultants to go on site no installation of hardware software and databases
4748082 it not only has to look right but it has to be useful and functional and has to deliver on a durability aspect that says that this is made really well
4748083 caprice was so successful with its easy casual living design we felt this was a great opportunity to follow up on a winner
4748084 it just seems like its a driving force we continue to bring out groups with underbed storage
4748085 our operating team executed well in the second quarter in spite of the difficult economic conditions
4748086 we exceeded our guidance for same store sales and were within our guidance for store rental and fee revenue and diluted earnings per share
4748087 we believe that we are well positioned with our marketing and advertising plans in place and should also benefit from customers attracted to our transaction due to the difficult credit environment
4748088 weve absorbed some increases and weve raised prices on some
4748089 you cant sell it for what youd like to you have to be realistic
4748090 weve had some recliners that we were selling for 349 that are now 399
4748091 some of our vendors are further away like in mississippi and the surcharges are pretty substantial
4748092 some of the vendors cant do anything about it but it just makes north carolina manufacturers much closer to us if youre looking at a 15 delivery charge on a sofa versus 45 thats a heck of a difference
4748093 its one thing for us to produce it but theyve got to get it from the factory to their store
4748094 when you look at diesel fuel its gone up a 1 50 in the last four or five months the sofa that used to cost 20 to go from craftmaster in north carolina to washington might be 25 or 28 now so thats going to affect the retail price as well
4748095 just barely covers the increases that weve been hit with
4748096 we all think that we have to have a 399 sofa
4748097 the consumer doesnt know the difference they never have and they never will
4748098 theyve got to come to the conclusion that maybe these price points dont exist anymore and theyve either got to suffer a margin hit or move on
4748099 we all agree as an industry that furniture is one of the best values a consumer can buy today in fact its too good a value and everybodys living on a shoestring and if we get hit like this with increases we begin dropping like flies we can somehow learn from this
4748100 were trying to work with them as much as we can to merchandise around them and retain our price points as much as possible
4748101 if times dictate youve got to do what you have to do weve got to make money the suppliers have to make money we dont want to raise prices and we do everything we can to fight it
4748102 dealers are trying to go where their money will count they are not going to an event but to buy goods they want to choose the one that is the most important
4748103 everyone is scaling back trying to do more with less
4748104 fresh looks and styling at innovative pricing with good value
4748105 some reps have more dealers coming than were at the january market some have less
4748106 we have a new premium motor that offers a smooth quiet recline
4748107 we feel the vegas market will be key to helping our business on the west coast
4748108 it will be our first warehouse stocking program previously we have operated something only for key accounts but this is for the general trade it will help us to compete with other smaller operations also developing those types of programs
4748109 we will flow goods through there not only to allow those customers who carry those products a backup plan but also to serve smaller customers who cannot handle a container and to allow us to build our portfolio on their floors
4748110 we will not disappoint the dealers walking in and looking for the reason they came to las vegas be it new product or a new account it is difficult to predict in this economy but we certainly will have the values for them
4748111 customers around the country are looking for new and fresh
4748112 a typical strategy and a typical offering is not what they are looking for well have something to show them that is new and exciting and different
4748113 but the question is how many secondary people will decide not to be there for whatever reasons business at retail has been very difficult for a lot of people and they are looking to save money regional chains or regional furniture stores or east coast majors may think its too far or too expensive to bring out their big buying groups
4748114 six of my largest dealers are coming to las vegas for the first time
4748115 las vegas traffic is usually pretty good for us anyway and with the opening of building c i have a feeling it will bring a good crowd
4748116 with the economy so sluggish buyers need to come to see whats going on
4748117 we are focused on consistent performance and will provide guaranteed pricing through the end of the year
4748118 we carry living room as part of our collections but we feel we need additional penetration in the market they have a talented team
4748119 with certain styles of upholstery you just cant get everything out of china
4748120 in terms of upholstery made in the usa is coming back
4748121 hospitality seating is a big segment of that industry and having manufacturing in the u s will help us launch our hospitality seating business
4748122 fairmont is a case goods manufacturer that does upholstery with their collections and we are an upholstery company dabbling in case goods
4748123 we will be the upholstered arm and they will be the case goods arm we will retain our identities and sales forces but there will be a lot of synergies and in terms of merchandising together
4748124 fairmont is quite large in the hospitality business and we are not in that business
4748125 when you have the financial wherewithal that you have with a fairmont compared to a small independent like ourselves we can broaden our line it just gives us some flexibility in terms of that financial wherewithal
4748126 most people are hearing about the change but it wont really hit them until more and more advertising gets out there
4748127 i think it will definitely gain momentum in the fall and you should see the growth in the category rise dramatically in the next year
4748128 the no 1 purchase this past christmas was flat screen tvs and i believe tv price points will continue to drop this coming fourth quarter
4748129 chris has experience and a passion for the business that comes from working in a family furniture business like ours
4748130 in response to rising transportation costs and current economic conditions home line is bringing shows to their customers to fulfill the home line vision statement make it easy
4748131 as we continue to grow at a rapid pace in the u s market we wanted a senior sales leader to help manage our people and our focus while still ensuring the highest level of service and quality
4748132 brandenburger landeier werden zu spargelk niginnen gek rt denn weink niginnen kann man leider nicht k ren da f r ein hochwertiges produkt wie wein die klimatischen verh ltnisse hier nun mal nicht ausreichen wer nichts hat hat immerhin noch spargel deutschland hat spargel so siehts aus
4748133 but i heard the deal was on the table for a while
4748134 i appreciate the organization for moving me if they werent going to have a significant role for me in the last year of my contract at the same time im upset they werent able to find a role for me
4748135 ive seen him up in the zone a lot more with everything and because of that his secondary stuff is not playing
4748136 well have to re evaluate him and see how we can get him going again
4748137 ya know jhonny i liked you so much better when you were just a ballplayer if you wanna be an interior decorator now thats none of my business but some of us still need this team now you listen to me this is my last shot at a winner and for some of the younger guys it could be their only shot i dont know what happened to you but if you ever ever tank another play like you did today im gonna cut your off and stuff em down your throat
4748138 retailers dont have to spend a lot of money to change the feel of their floors
4748139 thats important that it doesnt cost a lot of money
4748140 i feel like weve done our homework to bring the products to market our customers will be looking for
4748141 it wont look as much like aspenhome as youve thought about because we havent been known for doing much contemporary it definitely has a european contemporary look
4748142 like everybody uncertainty would be a common denominator among all of us
4748143 were realizing that with us having such big intros in april its overkill to do it again in las vegas so this time weve thought that wed continue to build on the april market
4748144 you could have a well styled piece in two different colors and the consumer shell perceive those pieces as different
4748145 thats the beauty of the accent business consumers are not silly if she needs to punch up the room environment she can do it more affordably with an accent purchase
4748146 on the accent end retailers always need a way to spice up their floors from an accent perspective i dont think were looking for a pullback whatsoever reed elsevier inc all rights reserved
4748147 consumers today are making purchasing decisions not just with their wallet but by consulting their own values
4748148 in our industry the result is a growing demand for green furniture manufactured by companies doing business in a socially responsible way
4748149 ipe is a phenomenal wood highly resistant to rot decay or checking making it a perfect option for outdoor furniture
4748150 and because we are working with an organization as reputable as the rainforest alliance we know we are bringing consumers high end outdoor furniture in the most socially and environmentally responsible manner
4748151 if you can only get six then why not get a better six
4748152 earlier in the year we had a successful partnership with the celebrity apprentice
4748153 natural response from comfort solutions is a new approach to luxury bedding
4748154 rather than creating beds to hit predetermined price points natural response simply creates the finest beds possible using the best possible materials the beds will speak for themselves
4748155 we have new licensees and we are showcasing the direction in which therapedic is moving we have high value lines that offer considerable flexibility to dealers
4748156 dealers are positioning our product as a premium solution for mattress and pillow protection in their stores
4748157 because we provide exceptional training and support to the dealers and their retail sales associates there is usually an attractive spike in accessory sales after our products reach the floor
4748158 the unique construction of our products provides the ultimate in protection without altering the feel of the mattress in any way
4748159 this is particularly important in visco and latex products the consumer is making the purchase based on a particular feel when they try the mattress in the store
4748160 the hospitality industry is a key market for premium bed and pillow protection products as they make a greater effort to assure a healthier nights sleep for their guests
4748161 the omniguard ultra fabric we use in our products is specially designed to handle the rigors of hotel use so we have seen a strong interest in this product
4748162 it is contemporary and specifically meant to go with our product
4748163 that customer base when they come in and see it they will buy it we want to make it easier for the retailer
4748164 our custom size program is another vehicle that we are offering our customers to help them make their rug departments a profit center
4748165 its very powerful for a store to be in a position to provide custom size rugs for each consumer
4748166 many times the sales process at retail is focused on finding just the right size rug for the customer and many times she buys what she considers the best fit for her room but not the perfect fit
4748167 this program addresses the end user that wants the perfect rug in the perfect size
4748168 for the past six months weve been focused on creating a matrix whereby every customer is within a 400 mile radius of one of our production facilities
4748169 this results in greater operating and logistical efficiencies which we can translate into greater value for our customers on a human scale it is very difficult and we understand that people are losing their livelihoods and some customers are accustomed to having a plant located very near to them
4748170 on a macro scale our customers like our products and have been encouraging us to reduce cost and add value this is a step in that direction we can produce the same quality provide the same service and deliver the same value with less real estate
4748171 second manufacturers can look to the range of products and skus they currently produce with continued pressure on component pricing sku efficiency and smart purchasing make a lot of sense
4748172 the bedding industry is dramatically different today for a variety of reasons among the most significant changes
4748173 the rise of specialty bedding and its impact on all producers the business model for todays major specialty manufacturers has catapulted them to prominent positions in the industry this has spun out a host of additional specialty producers and forced traditional companies to look beyond the innerspring mattress it also has helped the industry to dramatically raise mattress average unit selling prices which has generated positive sales even while units have declined this is another force that will continue to change the industry the cost implications are just now being felt and this will pressure all manufacturers to reduce costs to maintain velocity the shift from two to one sided mattresses has been a major catalyst for increased profitability among producers two interesting points about this development are that consumers seem to like one sided mattresses they dont have to turn and they dont appear to have questioned or challenged the cost value relationship of one versus two sleeping sides
4748174 our retailers are looking for an edge to help justify rising costs
4748175 what better way is there than giving them double the sleeping surface and all the benefits that come with it
4748176 the average consumer might not like to flip their mattress but she finds peace of mind in knowing she can if she wants to
4748177 restonic has a rich and successful history of developing and producing high quality products
4748178 from its humble beginnings in 1938 until today restonic has operated with a business philosophy that focuses on its retailers as business partners
4748179 were helping our retailers stimulate the consumers senses not only in terms of sight but also touch and feel by bringing new textures to the mattress shopping experience
4748180 specialty sleep is the fastest growing segment of the bedding industry
4748181 with consumer and retail acceptance on the rise we jumped at the opportunity to better showcase and promote our members products to retail buyers it feels like disneyland for bedding with everything from memory foam latex air and gel to water adjustable natural and organic bedding all at one site
4748182 this may be the best time to breathe new life into your assortments
4748183 even with raw material costs continuing to escalate the values of imported bedding are perhaps stronger now than ever before it seems that domestic steel foam and frame producers mail weekly price increase letters
4748184 revealed new opportunities in both innerspring bedding as well as specialty sleep
4748185 we truly are a domestic partner with the prices of an import
4748186 for the past few years weve placed an emphasis on extending our worldwide brand into the u s market and strategically opening new showrooms
4748187 this is the perfect time to introduce our new platinum luxe advanced sleep systems to retailers
4748188 the results are much more realistic based on shoppers personal experience
4748189 on behalf of norwalk furniture its employees and their families wed like to thank comerica for its willingness to work through a tough situation on a tight schedule
4748190 we are grateful that comerica understands the importance of helping save these jobs and keeping this 106 year old company in business
4748191 once had a vision to continue the strong reputation of the ostermoor brand one that complemented his own commitment to quality and similar high standards
4748192 ive always admired the great handmade craftsmanship of the mattress industry of the first 100 years in america from 1850 to 1950
4748193 even though technology and innovation in this category have come a long way many of the old manufacturing techniques can be used today to create an exceptionally luxurious bed
4748194 this is the opportunity for me to take my familys business and capture the dream of national delivery with the legacy my father created

4748196 bill colegrove and the senior leaders of aspenhome have played an integral role in the industrys fundraising campaign for city of hope

4748203 the wide range of companies that will be represented in the rrc during market will allow buyers searching for new services for their stores to find exactly what they need
4748204 we understand in this inflationary environment pricing can change from day to day
4748205 thats why we feel this program is so important and why our retailers will see value
4748206 where the custom piece can be tagged onto the existing container
4748207 in addition to developing unique and beautiful new designs for selamat their depth and range of experience will help us build out our manufacturing capabilities as well as our sales and marketing efforts
4748208 we made important progress in the second quarter in reducing costs stabilizing sales and laying the groundwork for a return to profitability in the second half of the year even with growing inflationary pressures and weak macro economic conditions
4748209 with several hundred retailers already signed up furnishings retailers cannot afford to miss this industry changing presentation no matter what kinds of home furnishings they sell
4748210 in these challenging times it makes sense to be prepared for a further softening of the economy and also be ready for the next upturn
4748211 we are selling the westlake mix to david li and going back to our roots which is product development marketing and selling
4748212 the best equipped producer of decorative upholstery fabric in china the company is vertical and they have more types of factories than any company we know about in china weaving printing finishing and dyeing
4748213 pleased that we service the large market of credit constrained consumers who need and desire our products and services even in these difficult economic times
4748214 we saw an improvement in same store revenues collection efforts and overall store level execution and our profitability exceeded expectations
4748215 were done to improve profitability and we will continue to evaluate the need for additional mergers and realignments throughout the year
4748216 we have never exhibited here until now but we have sourced products to many importers and distributors the product is well sold and well placed under other brands which is why most people have never heard of us
4748217 we have been doing enormous business in north america without doing it the u s way
4748218 we are working to bring a merchandising program to market
4748219 we want to hit sharp price points and bring higher end products to the marketplace and be very efficient in importing

4748241 because of the enormous production capacity from our factories in california iowa and north carolina our suppliers and our commitment to meeting delivery deadlines we will be able to satisfy the unique needs of contract accounts from large to small

4748244 he will be working closely with our management team to implement a number of new initiatives designed to meet the changing needs of our customers with johns arrival ill have more time to work at a more strategic level and opening new alliances in asia which is where my roots in the business are
4748245 as we continue to grow at a rapid pace in the u s market we wanted a senior sales leader to help manage our people and our focus while still ensuring the highest level of service and quality
4748246 after careful review the board determined that larry possesses the most unique and compelling set of skills and qualities to lead the company

4748261 for the past six months weve been focused on creating a matrix whereby every customer is within a 400 mile radius of one of our production facilities
4748262 this results in greater operating and logistical efficiencies which we can translate into greater value for our customers on a human scale it is very difficult and we understand that people are losing their livelihoods and some customers are accustomed to having a plant located very near to them
4748263 on a macro scale our customers like our products and have been encouraging us to reduce cost and add value this is a step in that direction we can produce the same quality provide the same service and deliver the same value with less real estate

4748268 my take is norwalk is a 106 year old company that has been though the great depression and the world wars
4748269 business for all furniture manufacturers and retailer has been challenging but im optimistic as a 10 year franchisee in little rock they will survive
4748270 at the current time were pushing our other lines more heavily
4748271 that could change today or tomorrow with a resolution to norwalks temporary shutdown the fact is we as retailers have to take care of our customers and deliver product on a timely basis
4748272 we have to put some plan in place to make sure we can keep it going
4748273 were a family business with people to hand it down to
4748274 any time you change the way you do business there certainly is going to be some backlash
4748275 we just think this is the best thing to do not only for ourselves but for our customers

4748281 in light of the current economic situation we felt it judicious to hold off until we can see some positive economic improvement
4748282 we are ready to go once we see signs that the furnishings economic environment is improving
4748283 its not a decision as to whether to do it the decision is when we want to start
4748284 we are still fully committed to our original campus plan
4748285 regardless of the industry companies dont just need a web site they need to solve a problem from finding new customers to broadening their geographic range
4748286 technology is just vehicle to help solve a problem our business is based on the fundamental idea that we help make our customers profitable online by using technology such as web marketing to enhance their business
4748287 business at retail is very soft and its a problem for everyone in the home furnishings business
4748288 our job is to keep on developing innovative products it will help us down the road when consumers come back to the stores
4748289 a lot of the big buyers were here the people who are serious about this business know they have to be prepared with new products when the economy turns around
4748290 traffic was about what we expected and certainly lighter than the heydays but the retailers who are serious about business were here and they want new products
4748291 we were open throughout both markets so atlanta was good for us the gift and home furnishings stores really understand what we are trying to accomplish with coordinated product lines
4748292 we have some innovative rug merchants who are doing very well because they have expanded into new items
4748293 they will eventually change the face of rug retailing i hope that other traditional rug stores will also see the advantages of this type of merchandising
4748294 i think its fair to say that the economy has scared some people and kept them away from the market but in some ways thats good for the people who did attend
4748295 were going into market with over 125 new rugs if we dont have new things it will only make matters worse its not a service to our retailers
4748296 retailers are professional merchants there are still sales taking place and they need new merchandise
4748297 since we introduced the paula deen line in january weve actually had a lot of curiosity seekers and weve been able to turn quite a few of them into customers
4748298 there is still business out there but youve got to fight to get it
4748299 we are very encouraged to have ron join restonic and bring his extensive capabilities and success with brand development and implementation
4748300 he brings a wealth of front line knowledge and a proven track record of successful execution
4748301 i dont believe that the specialty sleep category has peaked
4748302 for us it is still a strong category the fact is that there are fewer people in the market willing to spend big dollars these days
4748303 it would help if sealy could really make a push on latex
4748304 but i do think that business has peaked for the moment premium bedding of all types including tempur pedic is down
4748305 specialty sleep as defined by visco tempur foam and air is just a form of market segregation
4748306 there was a time when some limited players had it and other mainstream retailers didnt it may have made for a way to describe market segments but today as most retailers have some or both of the specialty segments on their floors we really have another premium product in our lineup i would suggest that we have integrated specialty into the mattress game and now it is just one more bed to pick from
4748307 the most exciting thing to talk about on the floor innerspring has become boring in almost every brand it has become the model t and any foam of any type latex or air feels different and exciting
4748308 there are new specialty sleep products coming out all the time
4748309 it is hard to see where to draw the line in specialty sleep these days
4748310 i think there is so much more out there that we havent even begun to touch in specialty sleep for example there is leggett amp platts starry night bed that is special
4748311 but we still sell water which is where we started many moons ago
4748312 our desire is to maintain the consistent flow of one of our fr solutions
4748313 if we do acquire these assets it would be our desire to make the fr product available to other bedding manufacturers
4748314 we are pleased to have entered into an agreement for the sale of several of wnis plants
4748315 we have carefully reviewed our options and believe that a sale will provide the best long term prospects for the companys customers suppliers and employees
4748316 the specialty sleep category has not peaked any more than the mattress category as a whole has peaked
4748317 we are all experiencing a slowdown until the economy structurally adjusts and changes consumers and retailers may be opting for lower price traditional and less premium products in the short haul
4748318 it is very very important to remember that in terms of technology and innovation the genie is out of the bottle
4748319 the consumer is now aware that their health and lifestyle is affected by their sleep they know that mattresses and beds have changed
4748320 the low hanging fruit of initial mass media driven sales may have been harvested by now
4748321 with the tightened economy people may be making other choices for now or holding off the key thought here is for now these are economy driven purchase decisions that are not related to the overall trend of better sleep innovations and technology
4748322 look to green non petroleum advancements to create whole new markets
4748323 i see a major shift in the entire american economy due to our desire to conquer this fuel issue and to survive
4748324 in the future we will be making that product customizable with finish options contrasting tops and bases two tone striping and things like that
4748325 thats what hickory white has been doing for many years and were doing quite well with that
4748326 we are really pleased that we were selected to bring her vision to retail and the trade
4748327 the lillian august brand is known for both product design and retail expertise and hickory white has long been recognized for the craft of the skilled artisans that make our furniture
4748328 i am delighted to have someone with jeffs calibre lead our team at hbc
4748329 his experience at polo bloomingdales federated and the limited is unparalleled in the industry and he will bring a wealth of retailing expertise to the canadian retail marketplace
4748330 i am excited about the opportunity to work with hbcs strong management team and grow the hbc operations in canada
4748331 the hbc brand is a great canadian icon and i am truly honored to be leading this company
4748332 by acquiring hudsons bay company along with previous acquisitions lord amp taylor and fortunoff we will have an unprecedented opportunity to recreate the retail landscape in north america
4748333 the strategy of the combined company is to create a greater focus on the bay department store business in canada with an emphasis on the customer by offering better brands and better service
4748334 we got really lucky to find someone of jeres caliber
4748335 its a special opportunity for us to have someone that can speak to our clients and truly understands what they are going through since he is a dealer himself
4748336 familiarity with the homestores will ensure a smooth transition during the leadership change
4748337 plans on working to make each of the five ashley furniture homestores the employer of choice then focusing on acquiring new locations for both home express and homestores
4748338 ability to attract top talent and his knowledge of the industry especially of new businesses will be a great asset as we prepare to grow
4748339 we are very encouraged to have ron join restonic and being his extensive capabilities and success with brand development and implementation
4748340 he brings a wealth of front line knowledge and a proven track record of successful execution
4748341 consists of less desirable furniture incomplete living room bedroom and dining room sets and other odds and ends
4748342 we sincerely appreciate toms many contributions over the years and wish him the best
4748343 we are mindful of macroeconomic conditions including low consumer confidence generally and that our retail partners report traffic continues to be down sharply
4748344 during the balance of 2008 we will continue to drive working capital improvements and anticipate reducing debt
4748345 we continue to implement our plan to align variable costs with sales expectations reduce fixed costs and improve productivity in our factories
4748346 leverage the existing work force and provide greater resiliency to changing demand conditions
4748347 we made the decision to take these actions to address weak economic conditions and to achieve the benefits of our plan sooner
4748348 we still expect that the companys strategic plan will generate previously announced annualized cost savings of 40 million to 50 million when fully implemented in the first half of next year
4748349 the accelerated actions announced today are expected to increase that level of savings to a range of 55 million to 70 million on an ongoing basis and will provide greater resiliency to negative market conditions
4748350 while the economy is not good the eastern section is doing better and a strong attendance is expected from new york new jersey and pennsylvania
4748351 why is this show doing well and most are hurting because these exhibitors do not want to spend fortunes and be in permanent showrooms that are so costly
4748352 this applies to the buyers who do not want the expense of travel
4748353 the addition of the entr e product line adds breadth and even greater value to whalen furniture s offerings particularly in the dining room
4748354 whalen furniture has a strong infrastructure and seasoned support staff in asia they are vertically integrated and own factories in china and mexico they bring a strong support and supply network
4748355 the designs they do over there will be available to us
4748356 we will take the product we think we can sell in the u s some of the styling is different not every product they do is suitable in the u s
4748357 in this sort of economic climate we were looking for a bit of security and they wanted dedicated distribution in the u s
4748358 they understand how important the u s market is and want to put some real effort into the u s

4748361 it is mainly a sales effort to grow accounts and add new business
4748362 that will not change but we will create new business with smaller accounts
4748363 the west coast customer base includes a lot of small mom and pop accounts that enjoy the opportunity to do business out of a local warehouse and we are addressing that
4748364 historically low levels of consumer confidence housing activity and personal disposable income has led to an industry wide weakness in consumer demand for residential furniture not seen since the early 80s
4748365 do we really know enough about this man do we really want this man the most liberal member of the united states senate as the leader of our country and his bitter and hate filled wife as first lady

4748389 heathrow does not compete with gatwick and with stansted or with luton or manchester
4748390 it competes with charles de gaulle paris it competes with dubai now and with schiphol amsterdam because these are big international hub airports so the ownership of these airports actually has nothing to do with competition
4748391 i think there is a mood in the country that just wants the business broken up but i think the competition issue actually doesnt wash
4748392 we will fully support the break up frankly it is about time
4748393 monopolies do not help consumers ever it was almost as if baa had won the lottery without doing anything they have been in a position where essentially they could control how we travel
4748394 virgin atlantic will be looking very closely at whether it is sensible for a consortium of airlines to potentially own gatwick it may make sense because airlines know how to deliver to consumers
4748395 the key factor is that the airports develop in a way that best meets customers needs structure is secondary to ensuring that customers get what they want
4748396 weve been calling for the break up for a long time and the need has escalated every year

4748428 the most important task in societies around the world is to improve the status of women not only in the interest of women themselves but for the benefit of society as a whole
4748429 let us keep in mind that women are not only victims but also agents women all over the world take charge of their own lives and this campaign is important in supporting them to do so
4748430 the say no campaign encourages governments around the world to ensure womens security and their right to live a life free from the fear of violence it has been demonstrated that strong political will and commitment to end violence against women is an effective weapon in the fight against gender based violence by means of improved legislation implementation and monitoring as well as a competent criminal justice system it is possible to reduce violence against women significantly

4748445 in hope of eternal life which god that cannot lie promised before the world began
4748446 for behold i create new heavens and a new earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind
4748447 my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my fathers hand
4748448 then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father who hath ears to hear let him hear
4748449 henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing
4748450 thou hast a few names even in sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy
4748451 he will swallow up death in victory and the lord god will wipe away tears from off all faces and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth for the lord hath spoken it
4748452 they shall hunger no more neither thirst any more neither shall the sun light on them nor any heat for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes
4748453 and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away
4748454 in the year that king uzziah died i saw also the lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple
4748455 for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord
4748456 and i beheld and i heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands
4748457 and round about the throne were four and twenty seats and upon the seats i saw four and twenty elders sitting clothed in white raiment and they had on their heads crowns of gold
4748458 and i looked and lo a lamb stood on the mount sion and with him an hundred forty and four thousand having his fathers name written in their foreheads and i heard a voice from heaven as the voice of many waters and as the voice of a great thunder and i heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps and they sung as it were a new song before the throne and before the four beasts and the elders and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand which were redeemed from the earth these are they which were not defiled with women for they are virgins these are they which follow the lamb whithersoever he goeth these were redeemed from among men being the firstfruits unto god and to the lamb and in their mouth was found no guile for they are without fault before the throne of god
4748459 he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal
4748460 for in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked for we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life
4748461 ho every one that thirsteth come ye to the waters and he that hath no money come ye buy and eat yea come buy wine and milk without money and without price wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread and your labour for that which satisfieth not hearken diligently unto me and eat ye that which is good and let your soul delight itself in fatness
4748462 all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out
4748463 and he said unto me it is done i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end i will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely
4748464 and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely

4748470 we pursue the art of the possible and if we move to protect even a single life weve done a good thing
4748471 artinya barangsiapa yang berkata kepada saudaranya se agama wahai kafir maka pengkafiran ini akan kembali kepada salah satu dari keduanya jika dia benar dalam pengkafirannya maka tidak mengapa tapi jika tidak maka ucapan itu akan kembali kepadanya
4748472 artinya ya allah engkau adalah hambaku dan aku adalah tuhanmu
4748473 artinya kecuali jika kalian melihat mereka dalam kekafiran yang nyata dan kalian memiliki keterangan dari allah taala
4748474 artinya katakanlah tuhanku hanya mengharamkan perbuatan yang keji baik yang nampak maupun tersembunyi dan perbuatan dosa melanggar hak manusia tanpa alasan yang benar mengharamkan mempersekutukannya dengan sesuatu yang dia tidak menurunkan hujjah untuk itu dan mengharamkan mengada adakan terhadap allah apa yang tidak kamu ketahui
4748475 artinya sesungguhnya darah harta dan kehormatan kalian itu suci terjaga seperti sucinya hari bulan dan negeri kalian ini
4748476 artinya barangsiapa yang membunuh seorang mukmin dengan sengaja maka balasannya adalah neraka jahanam dia kekal didalamnya allah murka padanya dan allah akan melaknatnya dan baginya adzab yang sangat berat
4748477 artinya dan jika dia yang terbunuh dari kaum kafir yang ada perjanjian damai antara mereka dengan kamu maka hendaklah si pembunuh membayar diyat denda yang diserahkan kepada keluarga si terbunuh serta memerdekakan hamba sahaya yang mukmin
4748478 artinya barangsiapa yang membunuh orang kafir muahad ada perjanjian damai dengan kaum muslimin maka dia tidak tidak akan mencium bau surga
4748479 artinya dan diantara manusia ada orang yang ucapannya tentang kehidupan dunia menarik hatimu dan dipersaksikannya kepada allah atas kebenaran isi hatinya padahal ia adalah penantang yang paling keras
4748480 kamu menuduh kafir orang muslim atau kamu membunuhnya itu sama saja
4748481 yang paling penting untuk diwaspadai adalah masalah pengkafiran karena menumpahkan darah serta merampas harta seorang muslim adalah suatu kesalahan besar kesalahan dalam membiarkan seribu orang kafir hidup lebih ringan daripada kesalahan dalam menumpahkan darah seorang muslim
4748482 ketahuilah semoga allah merahmatimu bahwa pemikiran takfir sangat banyak fitnah dan bahayanya dan menimbulkan perpecahan sesungguhnya kekejian yang besar adalah menuduh bahwa allah tidak mengampuni dan merahmati orang muslim bahkan dia kekal di dalam neraka selama lamanya padahal ini adalah hukum bagi orang kafir setelah mati
4748483 dan sunnah melarang menuduh fasik dan kafir seorang muslim maka tidak boleh mengkafirkan seorangpun kecuali yang telah disepakati akan kekafirannya atau yang telah ada dalil dari dan sunnah akan hal ini
4748484 pemikiran takfir itu sangat berbahaya sekali banyak manusia yang terjerumus ke dalamnya hingga mereka jatuh berguguran adapun para ulama mereka berhati hati sekali dalam masalah ini hingga mereka itu selamat dan tidak ada yang sebanding dengan keselamatan dalam perkara ini
4748485 tidak boleh bagi seorangpun mengkafirkan seorang muslim walaupun dia salah hingga ditegakkan hujjah serta dijelaskan kepadanya dalil dalil barangsiapa yang telah tetap keislamannya maka tidak akan luntur keislamannya itu dengan keragu raguan bahkan tidak mungkin bisa sirna kecuali setelah tegaknya hujjah dan dihilangkan darinya syubhat
4748486 melaknat seorang muslim itu haram lebih parah dari itu adalah menuduhnya kafir dan keluar dari islam
4748487 wajib bagi setiap orang yang masih mencintai dirinya untuk tidak berbicara dalam masalah takfir ini kecuali dengan ilmu dan dalil dari allah
4748488 dahulu aku pernah berada di belakang rasulullah lalu beliau bersabda
4748489 wahai anak kecil sesungguhnya aku ingin mengajarimu beberapa kata jagalah allah maka pasti allah menjagamu jagalah allah pasti kau akan menjumpai nya dihadapanmu apabila engkau meminta maka mintalah kepada allah dan jika engkau meminta pertolongan maka mintalah pertolongan kepada allah ketahuilah seandainya suatu umat berkumpul untuk memberikan manfaat kepadamu maka mereka tidak bisa memberi manfaat tersebut kecuali yang telah ditakdirkan allah untukmu dan apabila mereka berkumpul untuk memadharatkanmu maka mereka tidak bisa memadharatkanmu kecuali dengan apa apa yang ditakdirkan oleh allah atasmu telah di angkat pena dan telah kering tinta
4748490 jagalah allah maka engkau akan mendapatkan nya dihadapanmu kenalilah allah di kala senang maka dia akan mengenalmu di kala susah ketahuilah sesungguhnya apa yang tidak menimpamu maka dia tidak akan menimpamu dan apa yang akan menimpamu pasti dia akan menimpamu tidak akan meleset dan ketahuilah bahwa kemenangan bersama kesabaran kelapangan bersama kesempitan dan setelah kesulitan pasti ada kemudahan
4748491 isnadnya shohih meskipun sebagian jalan jalannya yang lain tidak luput dari kelemahan tapi pegangannya adalah yang telah di sebut di atas wallahu alam 1 1 shohih kitabul adzkar wa dhoifuhu syaikh salim bin id al hilaly 2 999 1000
4748492 hadits ini mengandung wasiat yang berharga dan kaidah kaidah umum tentang hal hal penting dalam agama sampai sampai sebagian ulama mengatakan ketika aku merenungi hadits ini aku sangat tertarik sekali dan hampir hampir aku gemetar maka sangat disayangkan jika ada yang tidak tahu dan tidak memahami makna hadits ini
4748493 inilah yang dijanjikan kepadamu yaitu kepada setiap hamba yang selalu kembali kepada allah lagi memelihara semua peraturan peraturan nya yaitu orang yang takut kepada tuhan yang maha pemurah sedang dia tidak kelihatan olehnya dan dia datang dengan hati yang bertaubat
4748494 dan orang laki laki dan orang perempuan yang menjaga kemaluan kemaluan mereka
4748495 di dalam ayat ini terdapat dalil bahwa orang yang sholih itu keturunannya akan di jaga oleh allah barokah ibadahnya akan meliputi mereka di dunia dan di akhirat dan dengan syafaatnya di hari akhir kelak mereka akan di angkat derajatnya di surga untuk menyejukkan pandangan orang tua mereka sebagaimana yang tercantum dalam dan as sunnah said bin jubair mengatakan bahwa ibnu abbas menafsirkan ayat di atas dengan ucapan beliau mereka berdua di jaga dengan sebab kesholehan kedua orang tua mereka
4748496 barangsiapa yang bertakwa kepada allah maka dia telah menjaga dirinya dan barangsiapa yang tidak bertakwa maka dia telah menelantarkan dirinya sendiri sedang allah tidak butuh kepadanya
4748497 ya allah jika engkau mewafatkan diriku maka ampunilah aku dan jika engkau membiarkan diriku hidup maka jagalah aku sebagaimana engkau menjaga orang orang yang sholeh
4748498 demikianlah kami palingkan dia dari kejelekan dan kekejian sesungguhnya dia termasuk hamba hamba kami yang ikhlas
4748499 sesungguhnya allah bersama orang orang yang bertakwa dan orang orang yang berbuat kebaikan
4748500 janganlah kalian berdua takut sesungguhnya aku bersama kalian aku mendengar dan melihat
4748501 tetapi mereka tidak bersembunyi dari allah padahal allah beserta mereka
4748502 dan robb kalian berfirman berdoalah kepadaku maka pasti aku akan kabulkan sesungguhnya orang orang yang sombong dari menyembah kepada ku maka pasti mereka akan masuk ke neraka jahannam dalam keadaan hina
4748503 dan siapakah yang lebih sesat daripada orang yang berdoa kepada selain allah yang tidak bisa memperkenankan doanya sampai hari kiamat
4748504 ketahuilah bahwa meminta kepada allah adalah suatu yang wajib dilakukan
4748505 wahai qobishoh sesungguhnya meminta itu tidak dibolehkan kecuali dalam salah satu dari tiga hal yaitu 1 seseorang yang mendamaikan pertikaian antara manusia lalu dia menanggung beban biayanya maka boleh baginya meminta hingga dia mendapatkannya kemudian dia berhenti dari meminta 2 seseorang yang tertimpa bencana hingga musnah hartanya maka boleh baginya untuk meminta hingga dia mendapatkan hal yang bisa menopang hidupnya 3 seseorang yang tertimpa kemiskinan yang sangat hingga 3 orang yang cerdik dari kaumnya berkata telah menimpa orang itu kemiskinan yang sangat maka boleh bagi orang ini untuk meminta sampai dia mendapatkan hal yang bisa menopang hidupnya selain ketiga hal ini wahai qobishoh meminta minta itu termasuk memakan harta yang haram
4748506 berinfaklah kepada orang orang fakir yang terikat oleh jihad di jalan allah mereka tidak dapat berusaha di muka bumi orang yang tidak tahu menyangka mereka orang kaya karena memelihara diri dari meminta minta kamu kenal mereka dengan melihat sifat sifatnya mereka tidak meminta kepada orang secara mendesak
4748507 didalamnya ada penjelasan bolehnya berpegang dengan keumuman hadits karena mereka dilarang meminta secara umum dan didalamnya juga terdapat anjuran untuk memelihara diri dari meminta minta walaupun sesuatu yang kecil
4748508 hanya kepada engkaulah kami menyembah dan hanya kepada engkaulah kami meminta pertolongan
4748509 bersungguh sungguhlah untuk berbuat yang bermanfaat dan mintalah pertolongan kepada allah dan jangan engkau lemah
4748510 ketahuilah seandainya suatu umat berkumpul untuk memberikan manfaat kepadamu maka mereka tidak bisa memberi manfaat tersebut kecuali yang telah ditaqdirkan allah untukmu dan apabila mereka berkumpul untuk memadharatkanmu maka mereka tidak bisa memadharatkamu kecuali dengan apa apa yang ditakdirkan oleh allah atasmu telah di angkat pena dan telah kering tinta
4748511 sesungguhnya allah menuliskan takdir semua makhluk ini sejak 50 000 tahun sebelum allah menciptakan langit dan bumi
4748512 sesungguhnya makhluk pertama yang diciptakan allah adalah al qolam lalu allah mengatakan kepadanya tulislah takdir semua makhluk ini pent maka sejak itupun berjalan takdir allah hingga hari kiamat
4748513 katakanlah tidak ada yang menimpa kami melainkan yang telah allah tuliskan untuk kami
4748514 katakanlah sekiranya kamu berada dirumahmu niscaya orang orang yang telah ditakdirkan akan mati terbunuh itu keluar juga ketempat mereka terbunuh
4748515 ini adalah kinayah perumpamaan kan berlalunya berjalannya semua takdir dari waktu yang lampau karena sebuah buku yang telah selesai penulisannya dan telah di angkat pena serta berlalu lama maka tinta pena yang di buat menulis itupun kering begitu pula yang dibuat menulis di kitab tersebut ini adalah seindah indahnya perumpamaan kinayah
4748516 berapa banyak kelompok yang sedikit bisa mengalahkan kelompok yang banyak dengan seizin allah dan allah bersama orang orang yang bersabar
4748517 jika ada diantara kalian seribu orang maka mereka akan mengalahkan 2000 pasukan musuh dengan seizin allah dan allah bersama orang orang yang bersabar
4748518 kemenangan itu mencakup 2 bentuk jihad jihad melawan musuh yang dhohir nampak dan jihad melawan musuh yang batin tidak nampak yaitu hawa nafsu barang siapa yang bersabar menghadapi keduanya maka dia akan mendapat kemenangan dan pertolongan dan barang siapa yang tidak bersabar menghadapi keduanya maka dia akan kalah dan menjadi tawanan atau terbunuh
4748519 apakah kamu mengira bahwa kamu akan masuk surga padahal belum datang kepadamu cobaan sebagaimana halnya orang orang terdahulu sebelum kamu mereka ditimpa oleh malapetaka dan kesengsaraan serta digoncangkan dengan macam macam cobaan sehingga berkatalah rasul dan orang orang yang beriman bersamanya bilakah datangnya pertolongan allah ingatlah sesungguhnya pertolongan allah itu amat dekat

4748533 artinya barangsiapa yang mendengar adzan tapi tidak mendatanginya maka tidak ada shalat baginya kecuali karena udzur
4748534 wahai rasulullah tidak ada orang yang menuntunku ke masjid apakah aku punya rukhshah untuk shalat di rumahku
4748535 artinya sungguh aku sangat ingin memerintahkan shalat untuk didirikan lalu aku perintahkan seorang laki laki untuk mengimami orang orang kemudian aku berangkat bersama beberapa orang laki laki dengan membawa beberapa ikat kayu bakar kepada orang orang yang tidak ikut shalat lalu aku bakar rumah rumah mereka dengan api tersebut
4748536 artinya sesungguhnya pembatas antara seseorang dengan kesyirikan dan kekufuran adalah meninggalkan shalat
4748537 artinya perjanjian antara kita dengan mereka adalah shalat maka barangsiapa yang meninggalkannya berarti ia telah kafir
4748538 artinya dan orang orang yang beriman lelaki dan perempuan sebagian mereka adalah menjadi penolong sebagian yang lain mereka menyuruh mengerjakan yang maruf mencegah dari yang mungkar mendirikan shalat menunaikan zakat dan mereka taat kepada allah dan rasulnya mereka itu akan diberi rahmat oleh allah sesungguhnya allah maha perkasa lagi maha bijaksana
4748539 artinya perintahkanlah anak anak kalian untuk mengerjakan shalat ketika mereka berumur tujuh tahun dan pukullah mereka jika tidak melaksanakannya saat mereka telah berumur sepuluh tahun serta pisahkanlah tempat tidur mereka

4748658 the legislature and the governor changed our marriage laws to please the well connected minority and force a social experiment into other states thats very offensive to a majority of the people at least the way the votes have been going
4748659 the fact that this happened the way it happened just adds to the sense of sleaziness and underhandedness of the whole process
4748660 ive learned that when it comes to equality for gay and lesbian people the struggle is never over because there are certain people that are just strongly opposed to any rights for gay people its never shocking it is disappointing
4748661 but its definitely easier when theyre younger it gets so much harder theyre very emotional theyre a little slower you have to deal with a lot of other things when theyre younger theyre like a soldier now i have to prove it myself to her we spend more and more time on that

4748664 this morning when i woke up i knew there wasnt anything else that could make me better
4748665 i just had to give it my all and hope it was enough
4748666 and she now knows that and after the practice im her father but its very hard for everybody im not going to hide that we had our moments credit my wife there she helps out a lot shes always mediator
4748667 i hope he is as proud of this as i am
4748668 i had to take my goggles off to see the 1 next to my name
4748669 when i took that extra half stroke i thought id lost the race
4748670 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer finished second
4748671 im sure people will be bringing this up for years saying you won that race
4748672 it was a real honor to race michael phelps and being in that situation where all eyes were on me
4748673 is when someone says you cant do something it shows you anything is possible
4748674 i thought he played well particularly in that fourth quarter in a lot of different areas both special teams and on the offense
4748675 when i got here it was you better be able to contribute on special teams
4748676 i had never played special teams in 4 years of college but i knew this preseason i would have an opportunity to show the coaches i can contribute on special teams and i can contribute running the football i know the assignments i know how to pick up the blitz
4748677 it was awesome when i handed to him and turned around the hole was as big a truck and he just did the rest but an even better play was when i threw him a low pass and he caught it with one hand and picked up a first down and we scored a few plays later that got us on a roll
4748678 with five running backs in training camp it is hard to get reps but you just have to be patient i knew i would get the reps in preseason games and when i got that chance i just wanted to do as much as i could
4748679 its the opportunity to pitch a couple of times before the end of the season
4748680 were pushing for a major league opportunity an affiliated opportunity he obviously needs to pitch
4748681 too many people trying to tinker with his mechanics and not let kyle jackson be the pitcher he is and he had too many roles it was just difficult
4748682 hes a local kid and we made every attempt to get him into a pride uniform we wish him the best
4748683 he was the first person to call me asking about jacksons availability
4748684 the red sox organization is stacked for him to be on the 40 man roster for two years is quite an accomplishment
4748685 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4748686 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i lost the race there but i guess that was the difference in the race
4748687 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4748688 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4748689 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4748690 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4748691 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4748692 he plays a big role because he can come in in the middle of the game
4748693 in the fifth through the seventh inning he can come in and get people out or pitch an inning or get a righthand hitter or two out and that allows us to keep madson and durbin organized in the back end of the bullpen in the seventh or eighth inning
4748694 i told them i want a playoff share and a ring
4748695 as much as all of us want to be in the lineup every day especially me knowing my chances are few and far between taking 1 day to let it relax and let it calm down immediately bypasses missing 7 8 or 15 days if you have to go on the dl
4748696 i feel a lot better about it yesterday than i did thursday
4748697 i thought denver would be my last stop but things happened and here i am
4748698 it was a fun game to be a part of
4748699 those guys have obviously known each other for a long time i bet there were some guys who werent even born yet when they started its pretty neat to see both of them pitching well at this point its pretty fun to be a part of
4748700 it just goes to show you if you know what you are doing and you know how to get it done you dont have to throw 95 to 100 to get it done
4748701 you can make these up to one week in advance
4748702 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4748703 the major league deal is basically what it took in order to get it done
4748704 its not a money negotiating issue as much as a life choice at this moment in time
4748705 ive spoken all week about how much ive enjoyed the olympic experience how much i love the spirit of it
4748706 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4748707 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself
4748708 fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it
4748709 i mean its just one point there is an umpire if im 100 percent sure about it i mean i will give it but im not sure
4748710 what is it its the new camaro thats what it is
4748711 the new camaro well it accelerates like its being chased by the hounds of hell hey i can relate but enough about my love life

4748720 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4748721 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4748722 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4748740 forever nobody thought there would be lights at wrigley field it was just something that wrigley was known for the day baseball there was such controversy getting lights in the first place then we finally knew there were going to be lights we went through the process of the first half of the year with the lights going up the lights being installed was exciting as everyone in the neighborhood could see the helicopters coming in and the lights going up in the anticipation of the light going up in terms of playoffs and the world series the commissioner peter ueberroth in 1984 when we made the playoffs told us if you plan on being in the postseason you needed to have those lights it is just a necessity in todays world
4748741 when the lights go on at wrigley field ill be comin home to you
4748742 just turning them on was very exciting when the old guy harry grossman turned on the lights the overall excitement of the whole thing that we finally got lights after all those years that was exciting just the whole event itself leading up to it watching them build the lights and put them up it was very exciting being here and brining in a new era it was festive it was party city like it is everyday now it was a dawn no dusk of a new era as i should say
4748743 i knew it helped the team in the long run playing the day games wears on you as it is with the heat and stuff i thought it would be better for the team as in their chances of making the postseason more often
4748744 everybody was running around everybody was buzzing i was doing a little security work that night so i was on the field just prior to game time just the light bulbs flashing just the buzz in the air was amazing at that point i had not witnessed a playoff game here so that was as close as it came to playoffs
4748745 it was very similar to opening day people were very intense and very tense the place was just packed the outside was just packed and everyone was just coming in at four and the gates werent open till five we had special programs for that night it was quite a spectacle lot of celebrities were here it was the thing 8 8 88 man
4748746 it was fun it was like the world series people were pumped up everybody wanted a ticket to the game the best memory was the lights being turned on at wrigley i had been here so long and never thought i would see lights then boom there it was i loved it
4748747 we will further tighten controls on foreign artists performing in china in order to prevent similar cases from happening in the future
4748748 we shall never tolerate any attempt to separate tibet from china and will no longer welcome any artists who deliberately do this
4748749 no country that admits that tibet is an independent country
4748750 would like to put importance on that i am not a politician i am first and last a musician and as such i feel my duty to try to express the whole range of human emotions
4748751 the guys who dont make mistakes move up and the guys who make them stay here
4748752 hey im here every year in support of kerry and sarah wood
4748753 you guys just happened to be paying attention this year

4748845 its a huge issue for cycling its restricting accessibility at a time when more people are trying to get out of the cars and highway 12 is a huge safety issue
4748846 but a lot of them come tearing down through here often in a group and they dont give you any warning
4748847 to push people out there would not be the right thing to do
4748848 ultimately the intent was to stop the cyclists because we felt there were other options and we spent a lot of time identifying what those other options were
4748849 were feeling like we want to reinforce our private property rights and withdraw permission to ride
4748850 in order for the wild oak people to get in and out of their community they go through my community from that alone it seems i should get access through theirs
4748851 im also a pedestrian and im hearing impaired and it is kind of scary having bicycles approach you from the rear very quickly
4748852 i dont see it so much as a conflict or an adversarial situation so much as it is a lot of people or a lot of groups working together to try and solve a common problem
4748853 first the city has to look and see whether it has any money and then we have to see whether the owner will entertain that
4748854 doesnt live in the mobile home park at this time
4748855 we were looking at schools where there was a possibility the kids couldnt get a backpack
4748856 we got lots of stuff everything from glue sticks to backpacks and pencils and all kinds of things
4748857 they get spiral notebooks they get pens pencils crayons scissors pencils sharpeners protractors all kinds of things
4748858 this is the most challenging and worrisome period of our history
4748859 i have never been so pessimistic about health care as i currently am
4748860 our ship has already hit the iceberg and its starting to go down
4748861 if you come in with a psychiatric emergency we should be sending you to a local psychiatric care unit of which there is now none
4748862 i think there is going to be some kind of crisis in the next five years that will require government intervention
4748863 ive seen it get worse over the years and as it continues to get worse i keep wondering when it will collapse
4748864 i am amazed at the number of underfunded and uninsured patients we see in the emergency room
4748865 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
4748866 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim
4748867 it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4748868 its not an endangered species on any list that weve got

4748882 this game was very easy to pick up and understand

4748884 right left this way that way its all so confusing
4748885 tak baik terlalu terhanyut dalam permasalahan bukankah kita telah tahu bahwa tidak ada sesuatu apapun yang abadi di dunia ini
4748886 kalau kamu sudah capek pulang duluan aja aku nggak apa apa kok
4748887 bukan itu masalahnya ndah tapi aku khawatir banget ama keadaanmu
4748888 kalau kamu nggak keberatan bisa nggak ninggalin aku sendirian di sini untuk beberapa menit saja
4748889 tadi pagi jatuh terpeleset di kamar mandi karena terburu buru berangkat ke kampus
4748890 kamu jadi korban orang tua kamu lagi mereka berantem trus melampias kanya kepada kamu
4748891 kamu harus bangkit bagas bersabarlah menghadapi ini semua dan kembangkan semua potensi dalam diri kamu aku yakin kamu pasti bisa masa depan kita kita lah yang menentukan
4748892 kesuksesan adalah takdir tuhan dimana kita sebagai manusia harus berusaha semaximal mungkin untuk mewujudkannya
4748893 makasih ndah aku nggak tahu apa yang harus aku berikan kepada kamu untuk membalas semua kebaikan kamu aku nggak punya
4748894 jadilah orang yang bermanfaat untuk orang lain dengan meraih kesuksesan
4748895 kenapa kamu menangis bukankah kamu yang telah mengajari aku untuk hidup bisa menerima segala kenyataan dalam hidup ini dan selalu optimis keep smile honey aku tidak suka melihatmu menangis
4748896 bagas kematian adalah takdir tuhan meskipun dokter hadi menvonis usia kamu tidak lebih dari dua tahun tapi kalau tuhan berkehendak lain kamu akan selamat
4748897 mungkin karena aku belum minum obat nanti kalau sudah diminum obatnya pasti baik baik aja
4748898 iya aku juga khawatir kalau anak cewek secakep kamu masih berkeliaran di jalan malem malem seperti ini
4748899 emang aku cantik ya tapi kenapa ya belum dapet cowok juga sampai detik ini
4748900 seorang lelaki yang baik akan hadir untuk kamu suatu saat
4748901 aku harus balik nih karena stnk dan surat surat penting lainnya ada di sana
4748902 gas tidur di dalam kamar dong jangan lupa ngunci pintu trus matiin tv ama komputer kamu
4748903 i think people are feeling keenly that the economy is starting to slow down and things are getting more difficult
4748904 i think the keywords here are sympathy and similarities young people are sympathizing because they see themselves and todays situation today in the novel
4748905 because of the kanikosen boom among young people the number of new members has been increasing
4748906 the working poor class people aged between 20 and 30 today can identify with the oppressed workers in the novel whose working conditions mirror their own
4748907 i can see how they would be drawn to the jcp which focuses on labor issues
4748908 im very happy with the gold its the third time that ive won a medal in this sport
4748909 now my boyfriend will understand why i didnt spend so much time with him last year

4748911 wir wussten das wir um eine medaille mitfahren k nnen das es aber f r so weit vorne reicht damit hatten wir nicht gerechnet wir sind unser rennen gefahren und haben uns darauf konzentriert
4748912 a swath of land bordering my garden is unusually green
4748913 i found that very interesting and began discussing with colleagues whether these fungi might be using the radiation emissions as an energy source

4749036 its certainly something thats long overdue were aware of a significant number of victims of this predator and i think that defrocking him is probably the first in a series of punitive actions that will be taken against this man
4749037 the unidentified stated that when he first had sexual contact with her he explained that it was normal and he described to her and told her in detail the story of lot from the bible
4749038 lot has raised his daughters in such a sexually perverted city that it was almost normal for them to do what seems to us so very abnormal
4749039 you have to be very careful as you read the bible to avoid taking a negative example as a positive example and copying that in your own life
4749040 they use whatever they can to influence the child to go ahead and engage in some type of sexual relationship
4749041 the most dangerous book the bible on earth keep it under lock and key
4749042 under lock and key but we need this weapon to meet the christian challenge
4749043 war is strategy and strategy demands that we use the weapons of our enemy
4749044 our challenge is to take the scholarship and make it enjoyable to a readership that enjoys history
4749045 i would say generally speaking that scholars would have no interest at all
4749046 what it ends up being is something that laypersons find helpful or would think it would be helpful any biblical studies expert worth their salt would not have much interest in this at all except as kind of a curiosity
4749047 it was very common in antiquity to attribute ones own writings to the most important historians in the past
4749048 it happens not just in the bible socrates certainly didnt say everything plato quotes him as saying
4749049 part of the problem and to me one of the flaws is the assumption that this bible is working with that narrative is the primary genre of literature in the bible that just isnt true
4749050 its like you would attach a pack of cigarettes with a warning label from the surgeon general
4749051 well this bible should have a warning from the theologian general or something
4749052 the bible can be intimidating for people and the chronology can help people put the timeline together in their minds
4749053 we try to put our bible studies now in context of when things occur
4749054 it would give people i think a greater sense of how things were laid out in that way
4749055 the year to go by with you macarthur thinking about it as much as they the victims have thought about the crimes committed upon them
4749056 when i look at this case the most aggravating factor is that absolute violation of trust and how sir you brought yourself into at least one of these families under the guise of trust and then you took that trust and you used it to destroy not to be positive thats what i look at
4749057 its a monitored permanent residence for priests who cant go back into ministry for various reasons
4749058 bruce macarthur will die in the very near future and the only thing he can do at this point to make up for what he did is hopefully convey peace and solace to the victims for what hes done
4749059 given the passage of approximately four decades that alters to some degree the traditional sentencing analysis the court is required to go through
4749060 my approach under these circumstances was to have a victim centered approach at this point in time 40 years later what do these victims need
4749061 one thing we owe the victims in this case is to give them some assurance to the extent the criminal justice system can do that that this sort of thing will not happen again that this defendant will not create more victims in the remaining time he has on the face of this earth
4749062 father macarthur used his position as a priest to gain the trust of my family in order to psychologically abuse me he used his role as a priest to take over my life from grade school through high school in my innocence i completely trusted him
4749063 i pray each morning for god to take away the sadness and emotional scars that are deep within me i harbor no unforgiveness toward father macarthur and most importantly i pray that he will repent if he hasnt already so he will be right with the lord
4749064 i just want them to know they are not alone
4749065 i know what happened to those boys because it happened to me too
4749066 we would invite pastor crumbley to report the allegation to the district attorney
4749067 and to meet with appropriate representatives of the archdiocese to relay his story and prepare a signed statement as we would with any person having an allegation of abuse
4749068 sexually molested numerous times on various occasions by father harris from the time i was 13 to 16 years old
4749069 he and i were so close when i was growing up that people used to call me little father harris
4749070 i loved him but father harris repeatedly manipulated seemingly innocent everyday situations to his advantage to create any excuse to touch me improperly more specifically to fondle or to grab my genitals
4749071 with the exception of sharing this information years ago with a couple of very close people in my life i have held what happened to me in secret
4749072 as a result for years i have lived with intense anxiety sleeplessness and night terrors the experience also has affected my personal relationship with women
4749073 i do not believe the allegations that have been made against monsignor harris you would have to know him to know that he is a man of integrity compassion sound judgment and superior intelligence
4749074 what his parishioners say is all true he is a great guy capable of great things

4749162 in the past it was about being a proud sponsor of the olympics
4749163 sponsors can get a lot closer to the action by sponsoring the people who are talking about it
4749164 theres no way a traditional 30 second commercial could bring people together in this way
4749165 we felt we had a great fit with everything the olympics stands for

4749178 i have this problem in a bad way one moment ill have very strong 3g reception and in the next ill have dropped the signal and switched to edge i can barely keep a call from dropping on 3g and this is in san jose and san francisco metro not the back woods
4749179 honestly at this point im a lot happier just turning off 3g and running the thing on edge all the time battery life is much improved obviously without all the switching and most applications run at a reasonable speed most importantly calls dont drop
4749180 i really do hope i can use the 3g on my iphone 3g sometime soon though thats kinda why i bought it
4749181 its entirely possible that theres a huge problem with the chips the phones or the network
4749182 its also possible that the press is going to latch onto any problems with the iphone because writing the word iphone guarantees people read the article cell phone reception varies so i can only report on what im seeing i have used the iphone almost daily since i got it and have had bugs a lot of random slowness some minor app crashes and issues with the battery it dies before the end of the day and you cant carry a spare battery but ive had no problems with reception
4749183 it may have been a temporary glitch or volume overload
4749184 listening to your customers for a large corporation very important but why just for iphone users i am in possession of an htc diamond but say the direct counterpart of the iphone my range is dramatically bad
4749185 it is certainly not the iphone i have an mda vario iii and also has poor coverage in various places in the country
4749186 my main issue with all of this is apples complete and utter silence on the matter what would be the harm in acknowledging the issue and saying we will have a fix in short order it wouldnt hurt and most likely would garner apple more respect
4749187 wow those numbers are definitely impressive we all knew it was going to be successful but i doubt any of us would have predicted this

4749221 absent evidence that bryant was able to employ hermione grangers timeturner device the limits of time and space mean that every additional job bryant took on reduced his ability to perform his duties at the other jobs
4749222 condescendingly dismissing the imagined defense response as the stuff of a childrens book the government appears to have lost sight of the gravity attending a federal indictment
4749223 is necessary to show how much time effort and political capital bryant was willing to expend in order to increase his pension benefits
4749224 now that the court has dismissed that charge the government boldly plans to argue that sen bryants rutgers job was so demanding as to preclude other work
4749225 can someone do anything to get the dog out and see if shes alive
4749226 i put her in her crate right before the fire

4749230 were sorry to report that since tuesday weve been experiencing issues with our shipping system so many of you have not received dvds in a timely manner and many of you have not received emails letting you know we got a dvd back from you
4749231 i mean internet based delivery would never have suffered from such an outage or something
4749232 is the same jackass who issued a report a year ago about the supposedly faulty
4749233 we do want to have a long term relationship with brett
4749234 he will always be a packer and hes very important to this organization
4749235 he wants to come back here he wants to be welcome back here
4749236 well its a decades old habit they just feel ok and dont want to change anyway they prefer green traveling and to be low key
4749237 i heard a fly buzz when i died the stillness in the room
4749238 because i would not stop for death it kindly stopped for me
4749239 oh kendra i love your oriental rug oh kendra that must be lenox oh kendra those shoes are snazzy
4749240 who invited the trouble here who invited this arrogance here who invited these innocent deaths here
4749241 not only those people who perpetrate them are responsible but also those people who failed to stop it
4749242 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4749243 russia has widened its zone of occupation and so far we are waiting for it to comply with the agreement
4749244 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4749245 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4749246 we will rebuild we want them out i want the world to know never ever will georgia reconcile with occupation of even one square kilometre of its sovereign territory never ever
4749247 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4749248 this time we were total underdogs it is a bit of disbelief actually
4749249 its an olympic final at the end of the day you can only push as hard as you can
4749250 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4749251 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4749252 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4749253 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4749254 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4749255 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4749256 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4749257 we have a mix but thats normal in our community
4749258 its what we signed up for what we trained for what we know
4749259 the relief workers were all smiles the whole time we were there
4749260 its there as soon as you arrive you see the reaction right away the gratification the relief workers super happy its one of the perks
4749261 but we didnt anticipate anything happening russia would not interfere with a humanitarian mission there was a low threat but there was always the unknown
4749262 briefed about possible threats in georgia we werent really worried
4749263 if there is a natural disaster or conflict we anticipate a call to the unit to go somewhere a c 17 will be involved one way or another
4749264 knows the aviation world because she was a flight attendant she understands but its hard being away from family
4749265 i just dont understand why in a town that was brought so much by the pageant people are willing to just forget such a legendary piece of atlantic city history
4749266 do we forget the rat pack when we talk about atlantic city history and remove frank dean and sammy from everything just because they eventually moved to las vegas
4749267 that pageant kept this town alive during some lean times she deserves more respect than that
4749268 it is important for our men and women fighting overseas to have the best training possible and warren grove is an integral location for their preparation
4749269 however this training needs to take into account the safety of the new jersey residents living close to the warren grove range
4749270 this is a devastating blow everyone was incredibly excited because this was going to be a fantastic research tool and one of the big events in the world of ancestry
4749271 we use the microfiches in hereford now but it takes a long time and it is not always legible
4749272 it has reduced access to this data and means people still have to pay and wait to access certificates
4749273 despite repeated warnings the government dogmatically ploughed on and outsourced this important and sensitive work to the private sector
4749274 yet again a private sector company has pocketed millions of pounds of taxpayers money for an incomplete job
4749275 a better more efficient service to the public and part of the governments agenda of

4749278 nat rlich sind wir in dieser saison die underdogs aber die k nnen auch bei en und zwar in die wadeln weil wir nicht h her kommen
4749279 thats what were dreaming of and well do everything we can to achieve that
4749280 we dont need no attention we all know what we can do
4749281 we will always have people who do not like the way we play but were through to the next round
4749282 i was not expecting for him to miss but i could feel the nervousness building up inside me so i wasnt hoping for it to last much longer
4749283 my personal motto is if youre perfect nobody can beat you
4749284 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
4749285 i hate america i dont respect it at all im running for president with the sole purpose of handing it over to terrorists
4749286 seniors have earned the right to cross the bridge when they want to
4749287 i didnt care for the original proposal we use the senior tickets and they are useful
4749288 use your money only on mass transit and the infrastructure to help the ordinary people
4749289 we hope the full board will give consideration to public input and not rubber stamp this like the finance committee did
4749290 i dont see efficiencies or reductions in headcounts the toll increase doesnt have to be of this magnitude
4749291 youre looking at a lumberyard have you ever seen a lumberyard catch fire thats the way this building went up
4749292 if we did id certainly think about having fire protection from day one i think a lot of people will be thinking about doing that going forward
4749293 and we were worried about the older houses on nearby elm street and hector street this building probably went up within two minutes three minutes
4749294 would have burned virtually any building the wind was blowing the heat in that direction but i will tell you and this is very reassuring to me that those buildings did exactly what they were supposed to do in a fire situation
4749295 if you watch how those buildings burned they burned from the top down
4749296 and that was the way that was designed so in effect the codes worked very very well
4749297 a good feature to ensure the fire wont go from roof to roof
4749298 my hope is that this will be a serious wake up call for better construction methods
4749299 seeing all these three to four story brick veneered wood framed residential buildings including assisted living facilities one wonders how safe they are
4749300 i concluded that this was an appropriate disposition in this case
4749301 people who needed to get assistance from the red cross probably already got it
4749302 my main frustration is that everything changes its a very fluid situation
4749303 it really gives you a sense of what people go through
4749304 its a little overwhelming when you write a list of stuff you need when youve lost everything
4749305 it may or may not be the same suspect responsible for all three of the sexual assaults
4749306 we felt it important to notify the public through the media of these sexual assaults
4749307 anyway it was hilarious have you ever seen that simpsons episode where homer gets fired
4749308 dont watch the simpsons but its basically the best show ever to be on television
4749309 for some reason i just cant get into adult cartoons when drawings start engaging in crude humor it just freaks me out

4749326 they were playing as well as anyone here to beat them i think upstairs is where these guys have needed to improve the most over the last couple of years theyve got to know now that if they play like that they can win this thing they honestly can win this thing its a huge boost but it doesnt mean anything unless we win monday
4749327 we played well three of the four quarters but greece scored five goals in the first we cant give up such a big lead in an olympic tournament
4749328 well have to be more consistent in our next game against hungary who are double olympic champions our tournament is not over yet we still can achieve our objective of finishing eighth
4749329 we came into this tournament and knew we had the capabilities of beating everyone
4749330 this really showed that that game against serbia was a fluke and were a gold medal contention team
4749331 us and serbia are a bit better than the u s a
4749332 they probably will be the third team in our group

4749603 each person is special to him who calls every star by name who has the hairs of our heads numbered and who knows the number of grains of sand on the ocean shores
4749604 and then a little laughing prayer came running up the sky above the golden gutters where the sorry prayers go by it had no fear of anything but in that holy place it found the very throne of god and smiled up in his face

4749608 the golden age when commodity prices could only go up is gone
4749609 our best intelligence estimate is that pandemic avian flu has already been created through genetic engineering in the united states fusing the deadly genome of the 1918 pandemic misnamed the spanish flu with the dna of the innocuous h5n1 virus in a growth medium of human kidney cells according to the national institutes of health and the vaccines manufacturer some virologists believe that this would insure that the man made mutant virus recognizes human cells and knows how to invade them
4749610 a basic virological fact that the public has not been told is that it is impossible to make a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist
4749611 given the shockingly obvious lack of any threat from an un weaponized h5n1 virus how can we explain the bush administration spending billions of dollars preparing each of the 50 states for what it calls the inevitable bird flu pandemic which they say could kill half or more of all americans and similar numbers of people around the globe
4749612 tyson foods inc has begun killing and burying the carcasses of 15 000 hens from a flock that tested positive for exposure to a strain of the bird flu in northwest arkansas state officials said tuesday
4749613 one of the highest rates of injury and illness of any industry
4749614 dangerous chemicals blood faecal matter exacerbated by poor ventilation and often extreme temperatures workers typically faced hazardous conditions loud noise must work in narrow confines with sharp tools and dangerous machinery
4749615 an experiment mating h5n1 avian flu viruses and a strain of human flu in a laboratory produced a surprising number of hybrid viruses that were biologically fit a new study reveals and while none of the offspring viruses was as virulent as the original h5n1 about one in five were lethal to mice at low doses showing they retained at least a portion of the power of their dangerous parent
4749616 the work suggests that under the right circumstances and no one is clear what all of those are the two types of flu viruses could swap genes in a way that might allow the h5n1 virus to acquire the capacity to trigger a pandemic that process is called reassortment this study is just showing exactly that there is a risk this virus can successfully reassort with a human virus said richard webby director of the world health organizations collaborating centre for influenza research at st jude hospital in memphis tennessee
4749617 terrifying biological weapons capable of killing only people of specific ethnic groups
4749618 the u s government is taking steps to minimize the need to make vaccine allocation decisions by supporting efforts to increase domestic influenza vaccine production capacity significant funding is being provided to develop new vaccine technologies that allow production of enough pandemic influenza vaccine for any person in the united states who wants to be vaccinated within six months of a pandemic declaration
4749619 two injections given 28 days apart may provide limited protection if a pandemic occurs
4749620 if h5n1 does mutate it is unclear if vaccines developed now would still work against a pandemic strain
4749621 three polish doctors and six nurses are facing criminal prosecution after a number of homeless people died following medical trials for a vaccine to the h5n1 bird flu virus
4749622 the spanish flu influenza virus that killed 20 40 million people in 1918 is currently under reconstruction several genes of the extraordinarily lethal 1918 flu virus have been isolated and introduced into contemporary flu strains these proved to be lethal for mice while virus constructs with genes from a current flu virus types had hardly any effect these experiments may easily be abused for military purposes but provide little benefit from a medical or public health point of view
4749623 the 1918 spanish flu was highly infectious and in comparison to contemporary flu viruses killed a very high percentage of those infected including many younger people the spanish flu alone caused the medium life expectancy in the us in 1918 to drop by 10 years hence flu viruses are perceived today as a serious biological warfare threat just two weeks ago a 15 million dollar research grant was awarded in the us to develop protective measures especially against a bioterrorist attack with flu viruses
4749624 despite the very dangerous nature of the 1918 virus efforts to reconstruct it started in the mid 1990s when dr jeffrey taubenberger from the us armed forces institute of pathology in washington dc succeeded in recovering and sequencing fragments of the viral rna from preserved tissues of 1918 victims in the current issue of the scientific journal emerging infectious diseases new genetic details of the 1918 flu virus will be published
4749625 but after partially unravelling the genetic sequence of the virus the scientists went a step further and began bringing the spanish flu back to life unnoticed by the public they succeeded in creating a live virus containing two 1918 genes that proved to be very lethal in animal experiments this experiment is only one genetic step away from taking the 1918 demon entirely out of the bottle
4749626 a resuscitation of the spanish flu is neither necessary nor warranted from a public health point of view
4749627 were tempted to say that nobody in their right mind would ever use these things
4749628 sanofi pasteur the vaccines division of sanofi aventis group announced today that the us department of health and human services hhs has accepted h5n1 bulk vaccine antigen to produce approximately 38
4749629 donate 60 million doses of h5n1 vaccine to the world health organization who over 3 years for the establishment of an h5n1 vaccine global stockpile
4749630 the h5n1 virus is currently circulating in some of the poorest regions of the world and an outbreak of pandemic influenza would most likely hit populations living in areas with limited access to vaccines this donation of h5n1 vaccine aims to address the needs of those most vulnerable populations in addition to supporting the efforts of governments
4749631 it is essential that industry collaborates with international organizations such as who the bill and melinda gates foundation and other global health players

4749659 buying a lap dance is not the same as buying a cappuccino
4749660 many local authorities have added their voice to growing calls for an end to licensing of lap dancing clubs as cafes
4749661 current licensing has acted as a floodgate to the industry whilst making it difficult for local authorities and local people to have a say in this process
4749662 it has helped normalise lap dancing clubs and attitudes that encourage seeing women as sex objects not people

4749687 i thought it would only be fair if i put my own neck out there with a few ideas of what id do with 40 million of capital if i flame out therell be no secret about that

4749730 we could drill everywhere from here to new jersey and its still years away and will only add about 140 days of oil supply to this country
4749731 i think the number one challenge for the national security as well as the pocketbooks of regular men and women out there is this challenge we are facing with gas prices
4749732 if we are going to increase the supply of oil then weve got to drill for oil in the united states
4749733 the bush cheney energy policies not only sound like they were written by big oil they were written by big oil and we are paying at the pumps
4749734 my opponent in this race who was the biggest proponent of sound bite solutions is now advocating the continuation of those very policies right now i hope this becomes one of the defining issues of this senate race
4749735 this could provide virginia with substantial new revenues that doesnt cost us anything
4749736 we have the potential in virginia to play a real leadership role
4749737 there have been rumors of more write downs in financials oil is above 140 and so investors are selling before the end of the quarter
4749738 i think the market doesnt like uncertainty and right now we have got a lot of uncertainty we have earnings coming up in july the continued high price of oil concerns about inflation stagflation and so there are still a lot of concerns and the market is pricing in those concerns
4749739 it sure feels like a bear market and if you are in financials it is worse than that financials have just really been taken apart and it has been a difficult week for investors
4749740 it is almost as if people have decided the second half of the year is not going to be better whereas before the light at the end of the tunnel was more visible people are concerned that it is going to take longer
4749741 we have been given no grounds to believe these issues will be resolved before senior international staff and their families will have to leave russia
4749742 unfortunately this now appears very likely we have been working with the russian authorities and within russian laws since april to resolve these issues and will continue to do so
4749743 many of the expatriate staff working in tnk bp will have to leave russia and may not be able to return
4749744 the loss of the staff will definitely damage tnk bp its performance and by extension the performance of the russian oil sector
4749745 doing the nation a disservice by focusing on a goal that is unachievable over the foreseeable future
4749746 if we can change our automobiles fuel from gasoline to natural gas during the next three four years
4749747 with an automatic you should get 29 miles on the highway 22 in the city and 25 combined
4749748 so on average you should be around 25 miles per gallon
4749749 i think everyone believes theres too much speculation in the oil markets and a lot of it flows directly from that particular loophole
4749750 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4749751 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4749752 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4749753 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4749754 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4749755 we have untapped oil reserves of at least 21 billion barrels in the united states but a broad federal moratorium stands in the way of energy exploration and production
4749756 it is time for the federal government to lift these restrictions
4749757 this is a case study of how a candidate can change a policy position in the interest of raising money
4749758 john mccain takes positions because he thinks its the right thing to do for america
4749759 he has a long track record of doing that and hes often made decisions that hurt with his fundraising base
4749760 about needing to tax the hell out of the oil companies
4749761 its for those reasons that the oil industry has always tried to be a substantial contributor
4749762 we must embark on a national mission to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil
4749763 we have untapped oil reserves of at least 21 billion barrels in the united states but a broad federal moratorium stands in the way of energy exploration and production it is time for the federal government to lift these restrictions
4749764 its disappointing that senator mccain is clinging to the failed energy policies of the past
4749765 is using the environment as a way to portray himself as being different from george bush but the reality is that he isnt
4749766 john mccains plan to simply drill our way out of our energy crisis is the same misguided approach backed by president bush that has failed our families for too long and only serves to benefit the big oil companies
4749767 ive never said that financial speculation is behind all of the recent price increase here but even if its some of the reason its something society needs to look very hard at
4749768 we could hire an extra 100 people and put them to work tomorrow given the inflow of trading volume
4749769 we are doing the best we can in difficult circumstances this is something that we are obviously concerned with the potential for manipulation
4749770 why are we sending staples to the saudis while we have our own food shortages and inflation
4749771 you are looking at a pristine natural habitat destroyed youre looking at dead fish floating in the water youre looking at shorebirds and migratory birds and waterfowl covered in oil
4749772 people on this coast dont have any idea of what it involves
4749773 if we were to signal in this country that were going to get serious
4749774 i do think that will send a signal to the global markets
4749775 as you can see this case was ready this was not a politically motivated case
4749776 the cftc has every incentive to show that the cop is on the beat and is doing his job
4749777 no regulator likes the direct scrutiny of congress or the threat of sweeping new obligations or worse yet the loss of regulatory authority
4749778 as you can see this case was ready this was not a politically motivated case
4749779 you should milk it for right now because you never know how long this thing is going to last
4749780 the same washington politics that has prevented us from achieving energy independence for decades
4749781 opec pushed its oil production to the highest level in its 48 year history last month even as demand was slipping in the united states and europe the international energy agency iea said yesterday
4749782 the correlation between government power and human suffering is close enough to demand that we evaluate it as causation

4749784 by hosting these poland is making itself a target this is 100 per cent certain it becomes a target for attack such targets are destroyed as a first priority
4749785 the deployment of new missile defence facilities in europe is aimed against the russian federation
4749786 today we had a chance to deal with the issue of high gasoline prices and the republican senators sent a resounding no
4749787 of everything they have done so far in terms of obstruction this is the politically most damaging
4749788 this bill is not a serious approach to oil and gas prices
4749789 raising taxes on those who produce something leads to higher prices on the product they sell
4749790 anyone in america who is filling their gas tank must think that congress is fiddling while rome burns the idea that we would bring up a bill that is called an energy plan that has no energy production in it is ludicrous
4749791 heads arent about to blow off their bodies right now they arent paying attention they have a right to be very very angry
4749792 senate republicans turned a blind eye to the plight of americas working families and our nations worsening dependence on foreign oil
4749793 theres no question that were paying a price today for decades of democratic opposition and regulatory obstacles to increasing domestic oil production
4749794 theres no doubt that the high gas prices are motivating people to change their travel behavior
4749795 thats a stunning thing and says to us that demand is there even if we raise fares
4749796 we havent had this situation before where the ground is shifting underneath us fuel prices are at a totally different level than ever before and we are facing surging demand
4749797 folks who are not regular transit riders to make that first step
4749798 thou shall give thou shall not kill and when you have done these things you have done his will

4749888 my son peter was three months old and i had to leave him with a full time nanny to look after him i wasnt doing anything except trying not to kill myself
4749889 before i had ten years of antidepressants and therapy to some effect bringing some stability using the alexander technique helped me to achieve a degree of healing that wasnt possible with just talk therapy and pills for me the technique became a lifeline i felt calmer from the first lesson
4749890 one experience i had is that i would just let the fear out of my body
4749891 of course at the time i couldnt see it as my balance improved my perceptions softened and with less fear came less confrontation i was better able to connect with reality
4749892 with balance in your body you feel less vulnerable more able to cope a good example of that is my sons crying when i started alexander lessons peters crying was the sound of m failure as a mother it was heartbreaking to me obviously a childs crying is not that but i had made it all about me using it to condemn myself with the alexander technique i was able to reassess the situation its just the sound of a babys crying it didnt pierce my heart a feeling of stability replaced the fear and self loathing
4749893 whatever is thrown at me now my spine supports me i feel that i can hold myself physically and emotionally i no longer see my brain in my head i see my mind and body completely co ordinated im much more balanced more selective in what i say
4749894 i used to rescue everybody that was my role in life that was the norm id get up in the morning and id rescue people the armour was on and i went into battle because that was the only thing i knew its very different now im looking after myself i think ive come out of it much more selfish what i didnt know was that if you look after yourself youre going to be so much better with other people
4749895 for me the alexander technique was more helpful for depression than therapy
4749896 with good posture and balance you are more able to withstand the physical and emotional knocks that life throws at you a feeling of a lightness and ease in standing and sitting replaces the sense of being held together by tension and fragmented body parts with lessons my body started to feel less fragmented more cohesive and with that cohesion came a new clarity of thought
4749897 you feel yourself getting into gear but you dont actually end up driving
4749898 it is reasonable to speculate that areas of the pre frontal cortex would be activated under the circumstances of a lesson and long term learning from the technique
4749899 if you teach an individual first to be aware of his physical organism and then to use it as it was meant to be used you can often change his entire attitude to life and cure his neurotic tendencies
4749900 at last an article which says so eloquently what i experienced as some lifesaving benefits of the alexander technique
4749901 you need to learn to look after yourself rather than become dependent on me
4749902 i came to the alexander technique a year ago with severe m e it was a struggle at first to get from the taxi into the clinic and today i walked home 20mins uphill i can also relate well to the huge improvement in my mental wellbeing as i had a plethera of emotional troubles for a large part of my life resulting in copious prescriptions none of which did anything to quell my extreme anxiety and depression when i collapsed with m e a few years ago i feared my life was finished but now with the simple beauty yet fascinating complexity of the a t lessons i know i have a new and exciting life ahead of me
