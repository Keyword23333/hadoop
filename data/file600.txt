6000002 telephony is critical to the success of our company and gohello has enabled an easy to use mobile service which our employees love and requires no technical expertise or understanding i would highly recommend gohellos allmobile telephony to anyone wanting to move away from the restrictions and complications of a fixed line phone system
6000003 with our previous telephony solution we often felt that important phone calls were missed due to our small workforce and travelling demands the gohello solution has overcome this as calls are now routed directly to employees mobiles our customers may not have noticed our new telephone system but that can only be a good thing by using gohello we dont need to worry about taking messages keeping the office manned or costly business calls leaving us to do what we do best running the business
6000004 i was hoping it the executions would be before the fasting month but it cannot

6000006 the possibility is slim because the courts are the ones who have the authority to postpone it
6000007 all who are involved will get gods wrath and curse and will be put in hell forever
6000008 but i was wondering why those who kill over 200 people are afraid of facing the death penalty themselves
6000009 i think if we have a review of the status of the death penalty we have to review the overall system of punishment because we dont want to see for example someone who is involved in a serious murder be freed before the age of 50 or below 50 and continue to be a problem for the society
6000010 the possibility of the death penalty being abolished has to be balanced with a more adequate system of punishment
6000011 im open for having this we are all quite open to discuss it

6000030 i think it is a great pity that baseball has been dropped from the olympic games
6000031 it was a great promotion for us as long as we were playing baseball in the olympics countries paid attention to us

6000033 ive only had a couple of people say boo back to me
6000034 it still hurts a little that he used the word front runners book said had evolved into what he said was a sincere attempt to get fans at the ballpark to be more positive
6000035 you had some cheers you had some boos i guess
6000036 thats what i said it was pretty much going to be again like i said if we get the win theyll be cheering
6000037 i was speaking for a lot of guys i wasnt just speaking for ryan ryans had his share ive had my share pat burrell has had his share i think chase utley hasnt been touched and hopefully it remains that way
6000038 a lot of times and ive actually heard it they dont want to put their family and kids in a situation where they come to the field and these are the types of things their kids are going to have to sit through and listen to thats just the truth those arent my words those are words that ive actually heard
6000039 but it could have been worse in my opinion i saw people standing up for j roll i heard some claps even though its pretty hard to hear way up here
6000040 im glad i did it im still hoping it catches on some more i mean who knows
6000041 it really calmed me down it made me think you can give any little extra energy any piece of yourself you have left you dont have to save anything johnson said
6000042 going into that last routine i didnt care what score i got i just wanted to hit the best routine i could to finish off my experience and not have any regrets

6000052 beam is my favorite event and ive worked hardest on this for a long time its the perfect ending to my olympic experience

6000055 it has been a little bit of a hard time since last week for the whole year she had the expectations and then she didnt feel perfect tonight she had a headache i told her shawn wake up and then i think she got the nerves out
6000056 it did hit home a little for the all around
6000057 honestly i go by everything happens for a reason for some reason the judges werent giving me the normal scores that im used to but they had a reason for it if they saw something we didnt i respect that i was meant to have the silver
6000058 i was proud that she finally got a gold medal now we can both say that were olympic champions that will be really cool
6000059 i competed a full meet about five times the only gymnast on my team to do that i feel ive given everything i have physically and mentally its just the end of the road its normal to feel a little down on the last day because youve given everything and you dont have much left in you
6000060 i was making uncharacteristic mistakes that i havent made in a long time
6000061 i think he was getting nervous just like i was
6000062 i was doing routine after routine without hitting them the way i did in previous competitions he was getting serious he told me to stop and take a second and gather myself
6000063 i felt nervous for myself but i didnt really care how the scores came up and how the placements finished i just wanted to give the best routine i could i didnt want to leave the olympics feeling like i could have done better or i could have ended better i wanted to finish it off as best i could i think i did
6000064 he sent me an e mail in all lowercase letters with no punctuation and no photo
6000065 i dont usually respond to things like that but he said he could beat me at scrabble that was interesting
6000066 i walked in and hes in the middle of the hearing
6000067 he knew what i looked like because i sent him a photo i figured hed be the guy in the big chair wearing a black dress
6000068 he pointed his finger down at me where i was sitting in the row and he crooks it as if to say you
6000069 i always told him even if we never married i would stay with him because this is the best relationship of my life

6000087 at present it costs about 63 000 a year to keep a person in prison so dr patel certainly is costing the state rather less than if he were in prison
6000088 while i can understand people might have question marks about them these are the requirements of international treaties and we have no choice but to meet those obligations
6000089 i think its relatively modest certainly as i understand it its comparable to if not cheaper than what it would have been costing if bail had been denied
6000090 the thing we all need to remember and queenslanders should not forget that none of this expense would have been necessary if the labor government hadnt originally flown patel out of australia one way business class

6000094 hanno ucciso padre thomas per tre motivi perch religioso perch cristiano e perch caritatevole verso i pi poveri
6000095 i suoi assalitori lo hanno aspettato sulla strada di ritorno da una nostra missione a burgida prosegue il presule lagguato probabilmente avvenuto verso le dieci di sera nei pressi del villaggio di balampilly una zona tristemente nota a causa delle violenze perpetrate da parte di gruppi di hinduisti fanatici lo hanno fermato mentre viaggiava sulla sua motocicletta e lo hanno massacrato a colpi di bastone hanno poi infierito e sfregiato il suo corpo con delle lame io stesso mi sono recato sul posto dellagguato la mattina seguente e ho visto il suo sangue intriso nella polvere ho visto lo scempio fatto sul suo corpo
6000096 stato ucciso perch i missionari cattolici sono dalla parte dei poveri in questa regione dove esiste ancora di fatto una ferrea forma di servit legata alla coltivazione della terra ai contadini non viene riconosciuto alcun diritto da parte dei latifondisti che si servono di bande di fanatici hinduisti per contrastare chiunque cerca di migliorare le condizioni di vita della popolazione rurale in questa regione il fanatismo di matrice hinduista usa la religione solo come un pretesto per compiere efferati crimini tra noi cattolici e i religiosi hinduisti moderati non c contrasto quando il dialogo riguarda i valori dello spirito i contrasti vengono creati da chi usa pretesti pseudo religiosi per scopi di parte
6000097 i fedeli in questa mia diocesi spesso vivono in una condizione di terrore risponde monsignor marampudi qui i cattolici sono veramente una eroica e significativa minoranza nella parrocchia dove avvenuto lassassinio sono solo cinque le famiglie che si dichiarano cattoliche persino frequentare regolarmente le funzioni religiose ormai un serio rischio come possono accusarci di proselitismo se la nostra condizione cos precaria i contadini delle aree rurali devono solo obbedire ai latifondisti che sono tutti di fede hinduista essere cristiani ed essere in particolare cattolici una scelta molto coraggiosa ma una scelta che mette a rischio la propria vita e quella dei familiari noi aiutiamo costantemente i poveri agricoltori ma certo non facciamo proselitismo tra di loro sappiamo bene che chi si converte al cattolicesimo in certe zone di questa regione poi obbligato ad abbandonare il proprio villaggio tuttavia la vendetta degli estremisti hinduisti spesso colpisce familiari anche lontani
6000098 lassassinio di padre thomas stato un atto di odio verso la chiesa cattolica in particolare ma anche verso tutti i cristiani che vivono in questa regione
6000099 noi religiosi cattolici risponde larcivescovo non godiamo di alcuna protezione preventiva non mi preoccupo comunque pi di tanto della mia incolumit fisica vorrei invece richiamare lattenzione dellautorit in favore delle nostre missionarie e missionari diversi gruppi di suore lavorano costantemente a favore dei bisognosi in localit relativamente isolate dove vi la totale assenza di tutori della legge lavorano con grave rischio per se stesse operano a favore dei bambini e degli anziani aiutano le mamme e i malati organizzano la scuola per i giovani analfabeti lavorano confidando solo nella protezione di dio si prodigano per aiutare il prossimo e rendere cos la testimonianza al vangelo penso a queste suore missionarie certamente eroiche penso ai sacerdoti missionari sempre impegnati in soccorso degli ultimi come appunto padre thomas penso alla nostra piccola chiesa di hyderabad piccola chiesa per il numero dei fedeli ma certamente grande per il loro eroismo eroismo per la loro costante testimonianza di fede in dio e nel vangelo ovviamente questo non significa che non mi dia da fare per cambiare questo clima di violenza in un clima di fratellanza e di concordia spesso sono in contatto con il nunzio apostolico a delhi monsignor pedro l pez quintana a lui chiedo di far presente alle autorit del governo centrale la situazione della mia diocesi e della chiesa in andhra pradesh in generale lancio appelli non solo in favore di noi cattolici ma anche in favore di tutti gli altri confratelli nella fede in cristo

6000103 la santit non un lusso o un privilegio per pochi o impossibile per un uomo normale ha detto il pontefice ma un destino comune per tutti gli uomini la santit offerta a tutti ha esortato papa ratzinger anche se naturalmente non tutti i santi sono uguali e non necessariamente grande il santo che possiede carismi straordinari ce ne sono moltissimi i cui nomi sono noti solo a dio
6000104 celebriamo la memoria di san bernardo di chiaravalle dottore mariano non perch abbia scritto moltissimo sulla madonna ma perch ne seppe cogliere essenziale ruolo della chiesa domani ricorderemo la figura di san pio x che visse in un periodo storico travagliato ha lottato e sofferto per la libert della chiesa ha aggiunto il papa e si rivelato pronto a sacrificare privilegi e dolori

6000117 sebbene gli utili del secondo trimestre 2008 di fiat siano stati probabilmente i migliori del settore pu fiat sfidare la gravit nel 2009 secondo noi no

6000119 anche se il titolo ha perso questanno il 25 ha perso molto meno dei suoi concorrenti e i suoi utili sono calati di appena il 6 contro un consensus di settore di 19 da inizio anno

6000144 sin duda cuando comenzamos el campeonato hubi ramos firmado esta situaci n llegar a la
6000145 nunca me ha gustado la idea de la medal race creo que abre muchas puertas a gente que no han tenido un campeonato para ganar un oro y puede pasar factura a la gente que s ha tenido un gran campeonato lo que hay que hacer es acostumbrarse en cualquier caso siempre queda la inc gnita de la medal race pues en la prueba puede tocar el viento para el especialista para poco viento o el especialista del duro hay un poco de factor suerte

6000153 there is a bit of a problem you see you are being very sarcastic in your articles by pointing out the behavior of the chinese people that is causing a problem
6000154 but dont you also see that when i point out peoples behavior here i also point to the even more ridiculous behavior of foreigners my conclusion is usually that all these people are behaving this way and dont have a problem with it therefore it is not them that is wrong but me
6000155 i see that but still you are pointing out behavior and that is not good as you know all media in china is approved by the government and if this is published it is like the government approving these things and that is not possible kent let me tell you this you are becoming too famous in beijing

6000199 simon has had a wonderful year with a strike rate of a wicket every 30 deliveries
6000200 the plan was to have simon still playing in september whilst this has not quite been achieved i am delighted with his contribution and the plan will be to rehab simon in a way to get him back fitter and stronger for the cricket that lies ahead of him

6000207 while there was a small month on month increase in activity it represented a notable decline from a year ago
6000208 this continues the weaker picture seen in june and points towards the more subdued levels of lending we are likely to see in the second half of 2008
6000209 lending markets are currently beset by high market uncertainties with the ongoing credit crunch falling rising arrears and repossessions and indebted consumers struggling to find credit
6000210 unlikely to require the divestiture of heathrow unless the sale of gatwick or stansted is likely to be impractical or ineffective
6000211 aspects of government policy restrict or distort competition by contributing to the current capacity constraints at baas london airports
6000212 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa but also for a review of the governments air transport white paper the commission risks delaying the delivery of new runways and making better customer service less not more likely
6000213 separate owners would be more active than baa in exploiting existing opportunities
6000214 we have provisionally found that there are significant competition problems arising from baas common ownership of seven uk airports
6000215 this is evident from a large number of factors including its lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity
6000216 this has resulted in investment that is not tailored to the requirements of airport users and lower levels and quality of service for both airlines and passengers
6000217 we have also provisionally found that there are competition problems arising from the planning system aspects of government policy and the system of regulation
6000218 while we accept that constraints on runway capacity in the south east will limit the scope for the benefits of competition in the short term we believe that separate owners would be more active than baa in exploiting existing opportunities
6000219 over time we would expect these to increase significantly in scotland where there are no similar capacity constraints we believe separate owners of edinburgh and glasgow would similarly improve their offerings
6000220 baa has argued to us that there is no scope for competition to develop so long as there are capacity constraints we take the opposite view unless the market is opened up to competition there is a serious risk that the current capacity constraints will persist certainly for longer than in a better functioning market
6000221 the earliest new runway capacity will become available is 2015 at stansted with no additional runway capacity possible at heathrow before 2020
6000222 while we accept that government policy and the planning regime have contributed to the lack of capacity we have found that baa as the owner and operator of these london airports has played a major role in not pressing for more capacity sooner and in planning terminal and runway capacity on a conservative and sequential process such that its plans for one airport have been influenced by its plans elsewhere we accept however that baa has been more successful in undertaking several smaller projects simultaneously
6000223 in scotland baa has until recently been noticeably slow to develop new routes at glasgow and edinburgh while at aberdeen its investment plans are regarded as unambitious despite relatively high levels of profitability at southampton it has shown a reluctance to respond to its customers demands
6000224 by the differences in approach to both airline customers and development between baa and owners and operators of regional airports
6000225 we have identified significant competition between several pairs of such airports with benefits which include lower charges development of new routes and a far greater responsiveness to customers in terms of capacity development we note that both manchester and london city airports have expanded successfully without explicit government support
6000226 in regard to regulation we have found that the civil aviation authority caa is constrained by the current statutory framework and that consideration needs to be given to bring it closer into line with those of other sectoral regulators such as energy water and telecommunications with better defined duties objectives and powers including the protection of the interests of consumers the promotion of competition and the ability to impose economic licence conditions
6000227 there is also scope for the caa to play a more active role in facilitating agreement between baa and the airlines by ensuring an appropriate framework for consultation which is currently seriously lacking
6000228 the significant problems in the baa airports market will not be solved overnight and changes in ownership would only be a first step in freeing up the market and providing greater scope for more flexible development
6000229 changes to regulation may similarly be important and there could be benefits available from a less prescriptive government policy on airport capacity development though we recognise decisions on such policies which are wholly for government will be taken in a broader decision framework
6000230 the commissions findings should be assessed in the light of the urgent need for new airport capacity and a modern regulatory framework as well as the need which we recognise for improved service from the airport operator
6000231 the findings state that the lack of runway capacity is a main reason for what it calls the current poor standards of service and the lack of resilience at times of disruption which results in regular delays
6000232 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa but also for a review of the governments air transport white paper the commission risks delaying the delivery of new runways and making better customer service less not more likely
6000233 we will be seeking urgent clarification from the government of how it believes this reports findings can be reconciled with the air transport policy it established in 2003 and its current review of economic regulation
6000234 we note however that this is not the end of the competition commission process and we will continue to point out to the commission the many areas where we believe its analysis is flawed and its remedies would be disproportionate and counter productive
6000235 just as the government is about to make the decisions that could lead to the first full length runways being built in the south east since the second world war the commission risks creating uncertainty delay and confusion at exactly the wrong time
6000236 in scotland the commission has apparently ignored the evidence presented by baa and supported by numerous respected third party organisations that clearly demonstrates that edinburgh and glasgow airports serve separate markets and therefore do not and would not compete regardless of ownership
6000237 is whether public opinion will be reinforced in its feeling of the uselessness of the french presence in afghanistan or whether the public will rally round their soldiers in difficulty and become more favourable to it
6000238 the juror who found this report went looking for it in defiance of what i said
6000239 it is very unfortunate for all those concerned and for the tax payer the chief consideration is that this defendant receives a fair trial
6000240 we need to control him and he will be once he returns to this country it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
6000241 he seemed fairly relaxed but tried to keep himself to himself some passengers started hassling him and asking questions but he got moved away from them all
6000242 at first he asked to be allowed to enter to thailand but he was refused he said he had not committed any offence here but he was told he was not wanted

6000257 officials concerned are working through the process of putting him on the plane to take him out of the country but if he continues to refuse to leave then he will confined in the airport transit area temporarily before being taken into a detention centre
6000258 pretty hard to imagine it would be legitimate for him to travel abroad again
6000259 i dont want any sex offenders in this country but the point is vietnamese officials have deported him to the uk so as we do whenever sex offenders return to this country we need to plan for what happens when people return
6000260 never mind his individual case anybody who is returning to the uk in these sorts of circumstances would be met at the airport by police officers would be served with an order which effectively puts them on to the sex offenders register
6000261 one of the things we have learned generally about sex offenders is they do want to travel to places where they can exploit children
6000262 if there is evidence the person is travelling abroad to abuse children we can get an order that stops them travelling there should be more of those
6000263 in every single case the court has to make the decision but this is the type of case where i find it pretty hard to imagine it is legitimate for him to travel abroad again
6000264 i think its right that we use police time to monitor sex offenders
6000265 if you are a british citizen you have the right to use the nhs whatever we think about an individual and this is a pretty despicable person
6000266 the last information we have is that shortly before the flight to the uk departed he declined to board
6000267 he decides where he applies to go and the country or authorities there will decide whether they permit him to enter their territory

6000279 it was the highest grossing film in singapore in 2007 but is not likely to go on general release in the uk as its a subtitled musical

6000353 your position on the space program seems to have evolved some
6000354 well its true that early on one of the principles that i have is that i pay as i go im not going to make a proposal unless i know how to pay for it and in one of our earlier proposals we had looked at extending the constellation program longer and stretching it out so that we could take some of that money to pay for education programs in consultation with space community here in orlando and around the country my conclusion is that we have to have that in place to have a transition from the space shuttle to the next generation of space exploration ive now been working with bill nelson john glenn theyve helped to unveil our plan it has gotten strong reviews from the space community and in light of whats happening in russia we have to start thinking about whether or not adding some additional flights on the space shuttle are going to be necessary in order to use the space lab the space station because frankly right now we dont know what our relationship is going to be

6000392 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
6000393 additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

6000455 we dont believe that we have set the ultimate standard here
6000456 but we believe we have moved the debate ahead by demonstrating that network control systems dont have to be too complicated it is simple for anyone who can use tv text to set up a device and an administrator after connecting a device can decide that it should only be visible or controllable by certain people
6000457 we demonstrated that devices could be automatically recognised by the network to move forward requires the manufacturers of home network enabled devices to agree on a number of standards

6000479 despite all the talk real implementation of virtualisation is very small compared to what we think its going to be and so customers are looking to see where it will help them
6000480 these technology shifts sometimes get delayed because of issues like licensing like support like interoperability and a whole series of other things that need to be addressed weve been working on these issues a lot over the last few years so that they fit the way customers tell us they are using virtualisation and to encourage the take up of virtualisation

6000600 the commissions findings state that the lack of runway capacity is a main reason for what it calls the current poor standards of service and the lack of resilience at times of disruption which results in regular delays
6000601 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa the commission risks delaying
6000602 comprehensive report into the market power of the baa monopoly and fully endorse its findings
6000603 competition works monopolies dont baas monopoly control over the london airports has been highly detrimental to competition and consumers
6000604 baa has long ignored the needs of its airline users and the travelling public and provided inefficient gold plated facilities encouraged by an ineffectual regulator the civil aviation authority
6000605 focus must be on ensuring that the current regulation of baas london airports is strengthened
6000606 the competition commission has provisionally found that there are competition problems at each of baas seven uk airports heathrow gatwick stansted and southampton in england and edinburgh glasgow and aberdeen in scotland with adverse consequences for passengers and airlines
6000607 a principal cause is their common ownership by baa there are also competition problems arising from the planning system aspects of government policy and the system of regulation
6000608 the cc is now seeking views on which two of baas three london airports should be sold and similarly which of edinburgh or glasgow airports should be sold

6000614 competing at the olympics was every bit as good as i dreamt it would be and i feel so lucky to win a medal in my first olympics
6000615 its definitely given me the taste for doing more olympics in the future i want to win a gold medal in london
6000616 the whole experience was unbelievable it is something that i will never forget in fact it was even better than i had imagined
6000617 tankers town will be too old by the time of the london olympics so the search starts for another impressive horse which means searching for an owner and sponsors
6000618 he felt very settled in the dressage and i think that the judges might have been a little more generous with their marks
6000619 he was superb in the cross country and was very tired when he ran out the second last fence 20 point penalty i was very chuffed with him it was a very brave and honest ride on a very difficult course which was fast and furious
6000620 some people said that the course was too short but the horses were all very tired at the end in the hot conditions so i think it was about right
6000621 the jumping was an exciting finale again tankers town jumped so well
6000622 we were all the centre of attention in hong kong and we certainly felt very much a part of the olympics
6000623 we didnt feel separate in any way the weather and fantastic and the competition was brilliant
6000624 although i was making my olympics debut i was able to get loads of advice from the more experienced members of the team especially mary king and william fox pitt
6000625 i had millions of questions to ask them and i learnt a lot about how i can improve suffolk homes
6000626 it doesnt feel real yet everything went to plan but after the success of the team i felt it might be too much to ask
6000627 i couldnt expect anything more its a dream scenario i feel like part of the team because you have to have a medal these days
6000628 i feel like a completely different athlete from athens i enjoy it a lot more and am lucky to have people around me to help me improve
6000629 i honestly dont think id be here if it wasnt for steve peters
6000630 ive wanted this so badly id beaten everyone in the field so there was a lot pressure on me to win a medal im the golden girl of the track but i didnt think about the outcome i just tried to focus on the process

6000847 there has definitely been a shift in advertising and promotion spending patterns to newer forms of media however the decision to use a particular kind of media varies from brand to brand we will use more of such non traditional media in the future not only for our existing brands but for new launches as well

6000878 concerned about whether the flow of freelance assignments is going to continue
6000879 demand for freelancers in difficult economic climates is always a bit of a u bend initially freelancers are the first staff to be cut by clients because the flexibility of their contracts allows clients to do this relatively inexpensively
6000880 then if the economy worsens the client embarks on a redundancy programme among its permanent staff finally the client realises that it still needs to complete projects but no longer has sufficient headcount so demand for freelancers returns strongly before permanent hiring recommences
6000881 hirescores com has had more people looking for freelance work than normal this is because quality freelancers generally cost more to take on board and so employers are either recruiting full time staff or simply not recruiting
6000882 people are nervous about contacting recruitment agencies and curious about which agencies they can rely on
6000883 however the mood of agencies still seems to favour freelancers
6000884 probably for the flexibility that they bring to agencies working on short term projects handling clients with post credit crunch jitters
6000885 external expertise in the creative area can be one of the nice to haves that general companies do without during times of financial uncertainty preferring to do it themselves

6000889 bei einem weiteren viertel ist der bluthochdruck diagnostiziert die patienten sind aber nicht ausreichend mit medikamenten versorgt

6000927 officers should have the opportunity to employ lethal force against those who would seek to kill them
6000928 it is difficult to think of anything which would serve the dissident cause better than a shoot to kill policy
6000929 it is also disturbing that we have anyone involved in policing at any level who cant work that out for himself
6000930 since ian paisley junior suffered the humiliation of being forced from ministerial office his contributions to pubic debate have been increasingly nonsensical and irrelevant this latest outburst certainly falls into that category
6000931 it also exposes a failure of sections of the dup to come to terms with the new political realities and a failure to learn the lessons of the past
6000932 the psni is not the unionist militia it replaced the days of paramilitary policing have gone with the ruc and cannot return
6000933 the way in which people will be convinced about the futility of carrying on pointless armed actions which do not contribute to any strategy to achieve irish unity is to demonstrate clearly that politics works
6000934 my greatest fear is that if we cant resolve these issues someone is going to be seriously hurt or well be dealing with a fatality we as leaders also need to ensure we dont say anything that further inflames the situation
6000935 police in foyle remain committed to tackling crime including that of a sectarian nature
6000936 we have a strategy in place to deal with incidents at interface areas and this has generally proved successful
6000937 police will continue to work with the community to address these issues and will actively follow up on any information passed to us by the public
6000938 im ready to go to jail im not going to do it im not going to be killed for anyone

6000942 the atmosphere will no doubt be fantastic as well because the spanish have a real passion for formula one
6000943 valencia should be a track that suits our car so im hoping well have a good race and take something positive away from spain

6000963 junior doctors are the people in hospitals most likely to prescribe medication and they are also the most likely to make errors in prescribing
6000964 we found that in all their training junior doctors learn about diseases and symptoms and what drugs to prescribe but they werent really taught about how to tailor those to individual patients such as dosage and frequency and this is where most errors occur
6000965 it really was a case of the pen being mightier than the scalpel
6000966 we dont let junior doctors operate on patients by themselves but we were letting them prescribe medication without proper training
6000967 we developed a safe prescribing training program that has been part of the training for all final year medical students at uq since 2006
6000968 parts of our program have also been adopted by the national prescribing service
6000969 we also developed a standardised medication chart that has been adopted by queensland health and implemented across all of its 108 facilities across the state as well as being rolled out nationally
6000970 no other country in the world has such a system of standardised charts and we are hoping to share our work around the world
6000971 while we will never eradicate mistakes completely these developments have seen a significant drop in prescribing errors

6000973 the link between cancer and environmental factors such as pollution and pesticides is not strong with scientists believing these factors contribute to only about two per cent of cancers diagnosed
6000974 more than half of those surveyed are also concerned about the link between stress and cancer but there is no conclusive evidence linking cancer and stress
6000975 what is surprising is that only a quarter of people surveyed highlighted uv radiation as a cause of cancer many south australians are more inclined to believe myths than reality when it comes to what causes cancer
6000976 the report highlighted that a large proportion of the community perceive factors such as pollution and pesticides to be a higher cancer risk than obesity when obesity has been proven to significantly increase the risk of developing cancer
6000977 there are many causes of cancer that we do know about such as tobacco use sun exposure genetic risk factors and diet and lifestyle the survey highlights that more needs to be done to educate the community about the causes of cancer and how to reduce the risk of developing the disease that 23 south australians are diagnosed with each day

6000987 comments add value to web sites they drive traffic and build communities the problem with most newspaper web sites is that they are comment ghettos sections of web sites that are left uncultivated and unloved by newspaper staffs in fact many newspaper forbid employees from interacting with readers in the comments section of stories and posts
6000988 if a news organization is not willing to cultivate comments and build a community then yes comments may not be a great idea but thats the real problem newspapers should care about building a community several beat bloggers that we track have exceptional comments sections on their blogs why because they actively engage users and write back to them they care about what their users have to say and their users know it how many newspapers can honestly say that
6000989 lets give people a reason to stick around newspaper web sites maybe it makes more sense for every reporter to have a beat blog dedicated to just their beat instead of the current model that most newspapers have for news online not the same as online news

6001011 we would also like to see the vat regime reformed so that products that have a long life cycle or can be easily and cheaply repaired rather than replaced are made economically more attractive

6001057 but first could you reboot the modem and we try one more thing
6001058 maybe we could let you have the modem for just the shipping charge if youll sign up for a year of deluxe service
6001059 how about i just cancel and sign up with qwest
6001060 well youll have to call customer service to cancel sir
6001061 obviously the governor is not happy with that phone call but we dont know what the investigation is going to show in total
6001062 really likes walt a lot but on this issue she feels like its she doesnt know why there is absolutely no action for a year on this issue its very very troubling to her and the family
6001063 he did not say monegan needs to fire this guy
6001064 can direct him to assist mr branchflower thereby fulfilling her pledge to alaskans to cooperate fully with the investigation
6001065 while theres an investigation going on you assume innocence but you take the person out of the mix just so there are no questions raised
6001066 its not up to mr branchflower to take personnel actions that will be the governors call when the time comes
6001067 others will judge what ive done and what i may have done they dont like
6001068 i like to read history but its not my thing to write it i dont keep diaries i dont do all that thats probably one of my problems now that i dont keep diaries
6001069 it is an election like no other the republican party is in just a huge disarray right now
6001070 the corruption investigations have caused people just to rethink what theyre going to be doing i think the vast majority of voters today dont know how theyre going to vote
6001071 i feel a huge debt to sen stevens but he might not be a viable candidate this time around
6001072 the only republican who can win in november and live to carry on the fight against the liberals in washington
6001073 ive got a lot of business interests in texas florida i spent a little time working for a company in california and ive been a long distance commuter
6001074 i think as people have got to know me in the campaign they know thats not true and the interesting thing about all that is the justice department has now filed a motion they said theres no legitimate doubt that ted stevens lives full time in washington d c i live full time in anchorage
6001075 an accumulation of wealth that ive developed over 38 years
6001076 would you call vickers would you call begich would you call the very nice gentleman from north pole who is a preacher or would you call me
6001077 ninety percent of alaskans would call me the question is who would they vote for

6001087 this is uncouth behaviour showing no respect at all for the national flag what is there to be angry with the malaysian flag
6001088 if there are malaysians who want to take up the idea that came from the pro opposition blogger they are insulting this important national symbol flag
6001089 its all in the blog only he can do a good job hes simply creating trouble by coming up with dubious stories
6001090 it is internationally accepted that raising the flag upside down is a mark of a state in distress it is never a mark of disrespect
6001091 a lot of innocent people died i dont deserve to live
6001092 at this moment thaksins legal team is proceeding to ask for political asylum for thaksin and his family in britain
6001093 his asylum request will note their malicious treatment in thailand where they lack security and freedom
6001094 at this moment thaksin amp squo s legal team is proceeding to ask for political asylum for thaksin and his family in britain
6001095 at present it costs about 63 000 a year to keep a person in prison so dr patel certainly is costing the state rather less than if he were in prison
6001096 while i can understand people might have question marks about them these are the requirements of international treaties and we have no choice but to meet those obligations
6001097 i think its relatively modest certainly as i understand it its comparable to if not cheaper than what it would have been costing if bail had been denied
6001098 the thing we all need to remember and queenslanders should not forget that none of this expense would have been necessary if the labor government hadnt originally flown patel out of australia one way business class
6001099 she did not move and stacey went over and kicked her and she still did not move
6001100 i was hoping it the executions would be before the fasting month but it cannot
6001101 i have nothing to cover up ill be open about this
6001102 the possibility is slim because the courts are the ones who have the authority to postpone it
6001103 all who are involved will get gods wrath and curse and will be put in hell forever
6001104 but i was wondering why those who kill over 200 people are afraid of facing the death penalty themselves
6001105 i think if we have a review of the status of the death penalty we have to review the overall system of punishment because we dont want to see for example someone who is involved in a serious murder be freed before the age of 50 or below 50 and continue to be a problem for the society
6001106 the possibility of the death penalty being abolished has to be balanced with a more adequate system of punishment
6001107 im open for having this we are all quite open to discuss it

6001186 when our american friends tell us its the middle east which is the most likely area of proliferation and nuclear chemical and biological weapons theyre not
6001187 its asia that has the most potent latent capabilities to develop nuclear chemical and biological weapons
6001188 thats because of the advance of their economies and industrial base

6001247 i am proud to say that i am a g double e k
6001248 i just learned how to speak like american kids because they made fun of my scottish accent and i didnt want to be bullied when im back in the u k with scottish people i actually go back to my scottish accent
6001249 im of the star wars generation i love science fiction star trek the next generation battlestar galactica love em
6001250 i love every morning getting up to go to work because that little boy inside of me jumps with excitement every time i know im going to fight an alien or shoot a rocket gun or be on a spaceship or be with the doctor or get onto the tardis
6001251 so every time im working on it im really really happy
6001252 i always describe it as in season 1 we were learning how to walk and in season 2 were running
6001253 he is a lot more comfortable with his immortality you learn about how the team around him became a part of torchwood and you also learn about his feelings and relationships with each of them which i think is really important
6001254 but it should be one of his best episodes out of his career too he got to kiss me
6001255 the reason torchwood has gone down so well in america which tv executives should look at is the fact that their audience isnt uptight
6001256 its the executives who are treating the audience like theyre uptight because theyre pandering to programming for one specific audience and forgetting about everyone else out there
6001257 the stories have changed there are stories that people can actually relate to
6001258 a lot of people who argue that the stories are too risque theyre too in your face theyre too heavy for young people theyre afraid of dealing with those situations and theyre afraid of seeing real life on television what were doing is actually what people deal with in their everyday life we just do it in the realm of science fiction
6001259 i like the writers to create the story and create the fantasy for me so that i can then go and try to make it work but if im on set and were doing it and a director will ask me to do something that is completely out of context from what jack would do or what any of them would do we can actually say something
6001260 the producers trust enough and we know the characters well enough that we just know they wouldnt do or say something
6001261 its going to be a different feel because were doing five days
6001262 its not going to change its not a family show were still going to be on after 9pm torchwoods a family show if you think its appropriate for your children to watch it we just deal with issues of life but no its not going to be toned down were still going to be edgy because thats what we are
6001263 gt dropped out to be in the doubtless crappy law and order uk but thats just me now what do you think
6001264 with all due respect to cardiff city theres only so many options in a place of that size for stories compared to a huge city like london
6001265 but how many people are willing to make a commitment to watch something over five consecutive nights these days whats the dramatic point that cant be served by weekly episodes or are they relying on everyone recording it or iplayering it
6001266 if a person who has had a stroke can walk across a room i should be able to run 20 miles
6001267 when you run you delve a little deeper into yourself and empathize when they hit their wall and think i just cant do it

6001270 ive always had good pulmonary lung capacity its been my strength its carried me through a lot
6001271 it was kind of half hearted i was not prepared

6001279 as an expression of somebody who calls himself a minister of health its a very unhealthy statement
6001280 i mean where does he come off where does he appoint himself as a moral judge of professionals who he doesnt understand and knows nothing about
6001281 is it unethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
6001282 so contrary to what mr clement might think were actually encouraging abstinence
6001283 my question to him is how does it affect you on a personal level that you should be so lacking in compassion for people
6001284 people have realized that when addiction touches their own lives in particular they realize that they really need a tool kit to help an addict and it should include injection sites
6001285 i almost feel a certain amount of pity for the guy clement because i think he doesnt seem to grasp just how sophisticated the level of discussion has been thats gone on around ethics
6001286 to just suddenly enter into the level hes entered this and think that he can sway the canadian medical association people with a few comments i think is very naive of him
6001287 too many canadians have seen the ugly face of drug crime
6001288 theyve had junkies break into their homes to fund a quick fix theyve seen young thugs dealing in schoolyards and getting more kids hooked
6001289 i certainly believe that its a positive development the fact that doping systems work and are effective

6001295 i hope to get good results in the last six races of 2008 and then i am moving to another team
6001296 the origin was in germany at the turn of the 20th century
6001297 in america workers comp took root later in the 20th century
6001298 from the start it was designed to cover most non agricultural employment where there is a valid employer employee relationship
6001299 this insulates companies from the massive awards a plaintiff can win in other kinds of court
6001300 from the outset of the workers comp system an exclusive remedy rule has applied which severely limits the right of the employee to sue an employer for negligence
6001301 the injured worker has all of their medical expenses covered without deductions or co pays
6001302 doctor bills hospital bills prescription drug bills all of that is supposed to be covered
6001303 after a waiting period which varies by state and is never over seven days
6001304 workers comp covers all the medicals and indemnity expenses for the lifetime of the claim
6001305 there are rules in each state defining limits to benefits for injuries not deemed permanent in virtually all states the injured worker and their insurer can agree to settle a claim leaving the insurer without any further open obligation in some states many if not most permanent cases are settled
6001306 what are often not covered or covered but with often complicated exclusions are mental claims and disease claims such as cancers from exposure to toxins
6001307 generally these are not covered but court decisions have addressed these issues in virtually all states and these decisions rather than the language of the law tend to govern
6001308 the most common ground for rejecting claims which can only be done by the insurer is that the injury was not caused by work
6001309 a proficient adjuster should be able to make that determination perhaps with the help of a doctor who inspects the worker
6001310 in many states the adjuster can delay making such a decision for months
6001311 and if the adjuster decides then to deny the claim the already paid benefits to the worker are not returned
6001312 under workers comp law a person is not entitled to get benefits unless they are an employee
6001313 im not arguing about medical issues im not arguing about doctors im arguing that this person is not an employee
6001314 and the rules set largely by court decisions vary by states
6001315 typically an independent contractor is being paid to complete a job to complete a task and is not being paid by the hour
6001316 if i hire a painter to paint my house im not supervising that persons every brush stroke
6001317 injuries by undocumented workers are usually covered by workers compensation
6001318 the concierge desk the porters the superintendents the maintenance people are all typically employees of the building
6001319 a lot of employees come up with phony claims a lot of doctors support the phony claims some employers take advantage and dont report everyone trying to save premiums and fees
6001320 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us

6001322 this is by far the most exciting cast we have in over 13 years of shooting live action movies for command amp conquer
6001323 the caliber of the performances we received both individually and collectively have really raised the storytelling bar for the franchise we are really excited that we will be delivering such a high quality production that is on par with movies and television shows
6001324 i wasnt sure what to expect when i came in to work on a video game
6001325 what i realized is red alert 3 is not just a video game its absolutely an interactive movie this is where the people at home get to move the story forward and where seeing the plot thicken is a reward for a job well done and thats really cool
6001326 i think video games are one of the new frontiers for actors and using live action is just another way to connect more easily to the gamer rather than cg or animation techniques
6001327 to be in a groundbreaking game like red alert 3 where we are using full on shooting of live actors and to be with jonathan pryce tim curry and peter stormare it was a great opportunity for a character actor like me to have some fun

6001331 the purchaser can vary the milk price schedule at any time by notice in writing

6001333 i cannot remember an august when we have had so much and the topper has been so busy but while lambs have grown well they are not finishing as fast as usual some have got dirty and we have had about a dozen cases of blowfly strike
6001334 we used an organophosphorous chemical which is brilliant for controlling blowfly
6001335 the sheep were wasting some grass but under our deferred grazing system it is cheaper to buy in the 3 4t of hay we use over winter than it would be to pay a contractor to make some for our own use
6001336 that assumes we have enough good grass to flush the ewes before tupping at the end of october which should be the case as all lambs have been weaned and the ewes are now on rough grazing
6001337 the group of us have the potential to market about 10 000 lambs a year and are talking to wcf and dunbia about developing a relationship and agreeing a minimum price in advance in return the firm would get supply continuity and lambs that meet tight carcass specifications
6001338 fortunately we are not short of keep but another season i would like to see some moved as soon as they weigh 34kg
6001339 the whole bluetongue thing is a shambles and we have decided not to try to sell six bluefaced leicester tups from our tiny six ewe flock at the nsas builth wells sale the sooner the whole country can vaccinate the better i have spoken to our vet and hope to be able to vaccinate from early september though the peak time for midges will be over then

6001344 the countdown is on to the most exciting games convention to date and konami has been extremely busy to ensure we have a roster of titles that will appeal to all facets of gamer
6001345 with an enviable range of games that spans pes 2009 silent hill homecoming rock revolution and two new castlevania titles plus a number of exciting new announcements we look forward to previewing what will be some of the major players in the coming year
6001346 the cost of capital of this nature is just staggering
6001347 they will want as much assurance as they can possibly get
6001348 you can determine how confident people are by listening to what they dont say about themselves

6001352 if you visit our campus you can quickly see for yourself the report is false
6001353 a significant investment in campus security to ensure the safety of students faculty staff and visitors
6001354 spreading demonstrably false reports under the guise of calling it gossip is something we hope the daily news will not assist more than that radar is not a magazine deserving of the daily news attention
6001355 the heroes of this great artistic labor tend to be semimonastic intro verts who like woods beloved henry james and gustave flaubert toil with the doors shut and locked in soundproof splendid isolation attentive to the subtle frictions among nouns and adjectival phrases
6001356 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative
6001357 franks portrait of the conservative movement sacrifices complexity to caricature
6001358 with rare exceptions like john kenneth galbraith conservatives have been the best satirists in thomas frank
6001359 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
6001360 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war
6001361 sharp as he can be in his judgments he is equally sharp in identifying the virtues of what he doesnt like he gives a spacious view of the countryside whatever the particular road he hews through it he takes his subjects seriously but not himself like snow white you might say
6001362 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
6001363 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent

6001369 we do not inherit the earth from our parents we borrow it from our children
6001370 technological tools such as gis bring to bear a proper understanding of these problems and a proper solution
6001371 it helps us in our endeavors to develop love and concern for other people these tools equip us to turn from passivity toward active engagement in developing much needed solutions
6001372 this year there has been a directional swing toward arcgis server and esri has really followed through with that by having technical sessions directed toward its use
6001373 ive been doing gis work for a while and it keeps becoming more and more integrated the esri uc offers the opportunity to learn about a variety of different solutions
6001374 were honored to be recognized with such a prestigious award and thankful to jack dangermond and everyone at esri for helping to make gis so successful in philadelphia
6001375 gis is enabling city leaders to make better decisions and achieve numerous goals as an information framework were looking forward to future applications and the benefits it will provide both city employees and the public in carrying out mayor nutters plan to improve public safety education economic development community health and services to citizens
6001376 the work of jim querry and the city of philadelphia is truly remarkable
6001377 they have a long history of innovation theyve shown how government agencies can operate in an efficient flexible and customer focused environment their use of gis not only helps the city of philadelphia but it serves as an example for other government agencies on how gis fosters sharing collaboration and cooperation among people and organizations

6001382 i can only pray that good people see roseanne for what she is sick of mind
6001383 i decided to start a network where people from across the world might come together and get a conversation started over me
6001384 i wish i had been nude from the time i was 12 until i was 28 i looked great
6001385 this set was built exactly 20 minutes before i walked on to it to shoot
6001386 they were nailing the floorboards down and i came in and the beds themselves the inside was all stone theyd discussed slate which i thought they meant was a color it was not supposed to be a coffin and i freaked out
6001387 they are supposed to feel a little bit like coffins but when they were stone they felt like not just dracula but like louis jourdan
6001388 isnt going to be buried like the pilot of firefly
6001389 a completely organic experience from the lunch i had with eliza which is something ive done a few times with her to going home and my wife saying yeah it sounds like the next thing just because you can tell
6001390 a week after eliza and i had lunch i went in
6001391 we are kind of living in a fish bowl a little bit
6001392 sometimes i dont like people to see the man behind the curtain i dont like them to know that something wasnt awesome before they saw it
6001393 you know the things we had to tweak the things we had to cut that is inevitable
6001394 but now i dont think it is just us the whole world is so much about seeing behind the curtain and seeing how things are made and how they work and the extended cut and what we could have done and what we didnt do and the alternate ending and you just you kind of take it as part and parcel at the beginning
6001395 he sent me an e mail in all lowercase letters with no punctuation and no photo
6001396 i dont usually respond to things like that but he said he could beat me at scrabble that was interesting
6001397 i walked in and hes in the middle of the hearing
6001398 he knew what i looked like because i sent him a photo i figured hed be the guy in the big chair wearing a black dress
6001399 he pointed his finger down at me where i was sitting in the row and he crooks it as if to say you
6001400 i always told him even if we never married i would stay with him because this is the best relationship of my life
6001401 ive been thinking about trying to get engaged to you for a long time and i cant quite seem to do it
6001402 when he repeated after judge washington it felt official it was official and he had never gone that far before
6001403 when people who love you offer to do things for you let them everything they do will make you happy
6001404 i got botox that was my crazy money 330 i only did it once and ill never do it again but it was fun having it
6001405 the very fact that bluecross blueshield capitulated so easily that doesnt say much for them as a company
6001406 at one point in society companies were more moral now we see companies leading the amoral rush to fund and subsidize and benefit so called homosexual marriages and homosexual led families
6001407 i fully believe that these two women love that child love that baby but the sad fact is that baby is growing up in a home which is intentionally fatherless by design and thats wrong
6001408 and thats going to handicap that babys life as she grows up she needs a dad and a replacement dad be it an uncle or some friend some male friend that these women have can never substitute for her having a father
6001409 im going to have cute boobs til im 90 so theres that
6001410 ill have the best boobs in the nursing home ill be the envy of all the ladies around the bridge table
6001411 i just wanted to kind of be rid of it
6001412 so this was the choice i made and it was a tough one
6001413 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really like you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes
6001414 and i think thats its all part of healing and anyone whos going through it out there its ok to cry its ok to fall on the ground and just scream if you want to
6001415 i love living and i really love my life and i knew that from this moment on it was only going to be good that was going to be coming
6001416 yeah ill face challenges but you cant get any darker than where ive been

6001424 la idea es crear una sinergia cultural entre el artista y el distrito nos centramos en los lugares que tienen una din mica cultural menos desarrollada
6001425 se dota al artista de un espacio para trabajar al centro cultural de un producto estable que ofrecer a los vecinos a los artistas locales se les da facilidades para quedarse a trabajar en la ciudad y al distrito se le dota de un recurso art stico propio y de un elemento de promoci n del distrito

6001427 wir waren so nerv s dass wir 14 tage zuvor jeden abend eine probe angesetzt haben
6001428 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
6001429 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
6001430 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
6001431 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
6001432 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
6001433 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
6001434 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
6001435 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
6001436 i actually really liked it it was a good combination of sweet and salty
6001437 chefs are trying to be more playful and incorporate new kinds of whimsy
6001438 we brought it down to the boardwalk and put it in a case just to see if people would react and they reacted
6001439 i didnt think it would be very good but once i tried it it was good

6001442 i was more anxious than anything the first time getting a chance to play at ford field after watching all of last year
6001443 every time i step on the field now im trying to get better and thats the key for me right now
6001444 after the first one i just felt that he got a little bit of swagger playing obviously he can run and do some things with his legs each and every week hes got a chance to improve
6001445 obviously im not going to do as much as i did in college but some of it was more so designed runs in college
6001446 its totally different the ball is up there a long time on punts and you dont get to see those guys coming at you its tough but i just got a feel for it
6001447 nuestro sitio est temporalmente fuera del aire por motivos de mantenimiento

6001451 we brought it down to the boardwalk and put it in a case just to see if people would react and they reacted
6001452 i didnt think it would be very good but once i tried it it was good
6001453 years ago i think food tended to be more traditional and less fun
6001454 its the melding of both these worlds the high end and the low end

6001457 we need to control him and he will be once he returns to this country
6001458 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
6001459 i want gary glitter to be controlled whilst hes here and i dont want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children
6001460 the uk has a rigorous system in place for managing child sex offenders which is among the toughest in the world the changes im announcing today will strengthen that even further
6001461 i want to see anyone who poses a threat to our children dealt with as firmly as possible ive spoken to child protection experts and the police and they have told me that these changes will further restrict the ability of child sex offenders to harm children both here and overseas
6001462 i will legislate for these measures as soon as possible
6001463 we have been consistently saying that when there is clear evidence a sex offender poses a risk the authorities must have effective powers to stop them from going abroad
6001464 but if they do travel there must be better systems in place to monitor and track their movements the uk government has a crucial role to play in working more closely with other governments and police to keeps sex offenders on the radar and bring those who commit sexual crimes against children to justice

6001473 det er en helt fair l n selv hos sm selskaber er 50 000 for en bestyrelsespost og 100 000 for en formandspost helt normal og hos b rsnoterede virksomheder er det helt normalt at formandsposten afl nnes med en millionl n

6001548 new jersey has done what no other state has attempted used testing of pilot projects to launch successfully a new system of legislative campaign financing the creation of a clean election program for all legislative elections would be a significant step towards increasing competition in legislative races and restricting the influence of large contributions on the political process

6001550 the anniversary of the september 11 terrorist attacks should forever remain a day of unity
6001551 all of us including those seeking public office can best honor the memories of those lost by engaging in community service and other charitable acts on that day which help to recall and rekindle the remarkable spirit of unity and compassion that existed in our country in the weeks and months following the 9 11 tragedy
6001552 9 11 helped us realize in an instant how insignificant our differences really are in comparison to our common goodness as human beings and our shared sense of compassion for those in need
6001553 it hardly mattered what political party we supported or whether we came from a red state or blue state at that moment we were all human beings and it is important that we find a way each year on 9 11 to honor that spirit of togetherness and keep it alive
6001554 as a 9 11 family member the only good thing that came from that terrible day was the way our nation came together however fleeting that moment might have been
6001555 i cannot think of a better way to honor the memories of those lost than to put aside our differences for just a little while and consider what the world could be like if we preserved that sense of compassion and understanding at other times throughout the year

6001640 criminalising clients forces prostitution further underground women have even less time to check out men fearful of arrest instead women are pushed into more isolated less well lit areas where they are more vulnerable to attack whatever anyone thinks about men paying for sex safety should be the priority

6001651 until september 20th when training camp opens he hasnt quit anything
6001652 there are significant competition problems arising from baas common ownership of seven uk airports this is evident from its lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity
6001653 airports are individual monopolies selling a monopoly to anew owner will not help protect the consumer or improveefficiency airports need better regulation
6001654 a break up of baa is a step forward but it is the bronzemedal at the consumer protection olympics a gold medal would bea better more effective regulator

6001657 a well used tool by webmasters looking to increase the interactive features of their site and get to know their visitors better
6001658 a monitoring is ongoing as it is always the case whenmovements diverge from standard ones
6001659 i obviously know that at the end of the day the owner has the final say in whether or not he wants to give a guy an opportunity
6001660 and mike has wanted to give chris this opportunity and asked that we do the best job we can to get him ready to play football
6001661 if he can be a positive influence on this football team and help us win games and be productive as a receiver get better as a receiver if we feel that way after the suspension is over then he has a chance to earn a spot thats what brown asked me to do so thats what were going to do
6001662 but i know thats what im looking at its pretty much my last chance to prove myself
6001663 it happens all over the league its no different here marvin is a great coach he didnt lose any credibility with us
6001664 its tough because we play against some of the best competition in the country
6001665 one of our opponents is cal berkeley and those guys are consistent national champions they have players who have 12 years of experience while some of our players are playing in the first or second game of their careers
6001666 we also need fast guys to play outside to get around the hitting
6001667 rugby is the main sport down there so all their great athletes dont play football like they do here they play rugby that was the main difference from rugby in america the talent level was much better
6001668 i just told family members my aunts and uncles what i was doing
6001669 we just need to keep recruiting players and start generating interest in the community
6001670 its a great way for people to get the feel of playing sports in college if they cant make it on the actual team
6001671 we want clean artists artists that are good role models
6001672 i would even go further to say the worst is to come
6001673 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks

6001677 lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity
6001678 while we accept that constraints on runway capacity in the south east will limit the scope for the benefits of competition in the short term we believe that separate owners would be more active than baa in exploiting existing opportunities
6001679 just as the government is about to make the decisions that could lead to the first full length runways being built in the south east since the second world war the commission risks creating uncertainty delay and confusion at exactly the wrong time
6001680 in scotland the commission has apparently ignored the evidence presented by baa and supported by numerous respected third party organisations that clearly demonstrates that serve separate markets and therefore do not and would not compete regardless of ownership
6001681 three times medvedev has said they are starting the withdrawal and they have not
6001682 we cannot accept this kind of blindness not accepting international law
6001683 the territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognised borders
6001684 its becoming more and more the outlaw in this conflict
6001685 they intend and probably still do intend to strangle georgia and its economy
6001686 as a european nation georgians have continued to resist in peaceful ways and this peaceful resistance will continue and intensify
6001687 als ik alleen maar zou verdedigen heb ik tegen zulke goede speelsters geen kans

6001689 dat kan vanaf oktober dan gaan we goed geld verdienen in las vegas met twee optredens per dag in een groot casino we hebben hier in peking op een prima manier afscheid genomen van onze actieve loopbaan dat geeft een heerlijk gevoel
6001690 zo gaat dat nu eenmaal in onze sport als ze laag beginnen kunnen ze later makkelijker hogere punten geven zo is het nu eenmaal niets aan te doen
6001691 ik ben zeer tevreden ze kunnen niet beter dan wat ze hier hebben laten zien voor mij zijn ze briljant ik ga ze missen maar ze zijn toe aan een nieuwe stap in hun carri re en in hun leven in las vegas kunnen ze veel geld verdienen en ja ze kunnen er ook trouwen eventueel ik gun hen het allerbeste
6001692 als coach werk je maar zelden met zulke fantastische persoonlijkheden als bianca en sonja ze hebben zoveel toewijding zoveel passie en zoveel inzet voor hun sport beter kun je als coach niet wensen in al die jaren zijn ze niet n keer te laat op een training verschenen voor mij zijn zij de real deal topmeiden dus

6001698 i think we should speed it up moreover the west and israel continue to put pressure on russia
6001699 damascus is moscows long standing partner in military cooperation and we are expecting to reach an agreement in principle on new weapons deals
6001700 i think that in russia and in the world everyone is now aware of israels role and its military consultants in the georgian crisis
6001701 and if before in russia there were people who thought these forces can be friendly then now i think no one thinks that way

6001713 ebays move to court more fixed price sellers is likely to be just as controversial as its prior changes auction sellers have argued that ebay is
6001714 the vocal minority is going to be exceedingly vocal about this
6001715 i think it is a great step and for the fixed price sellers it is a big step
6001716 one of the companys boldest moves this year to boost merchandise for sale lure new buyers and take on competitors
6001717 the novelty of online auctions has waned and rivals like amazon have muscled in on its turf with strong fixed price offerings

6001720 it seems to be fashionable to take a knife and kill fellow pupils
6001721 perhaps it is high time that the education ministry calls a summit to discuss the safety question with all the stakeholders involved otherwise we would continue to breed thugs who are comfortable with violating and murdering fellow pupils

6001731 these standards will help u s museums shape their policies and practices to effectively promote the preservation of our common cultural patrimony
6001732 the american people rely on museums to preserve and interpret the worlds cultural heritage

6001762 in dieser hinsicht haben sich die positionen seit april nicht gro ver ndert als georgien das recht auf die nato mitgliedschaft verweigert wurde und gegner der harten linie gegen ber moskau sind vor allem frankreich und deutschland geblieben
6001763 f r die amerikaner ist der konflikt in georgien nur eine missgl ckte kraftprobe im raum der ehemaligen udssr f r das alte europa ist es von bedeutung dass georgien diese furchtbare humanit re krise provoziert hat aber auch nicht minder von bedeutung dass russland au erhalb der verantwortungszone der friedenstruppen gewalt angewandt hat
6001764 sowohl iran der faktisch die schaffung einer interkontinentalrakete bekannt gegeben hat als auch das unruhige pakistan verbleiben indes ist die berwindung dieser zwei krisen ohne zusammenarbeit mit moskau unm glich

6001789 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
6001790 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
6001791 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
6001792 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
6001793 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
6001794 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
6001795 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
6001796 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
6001797 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
6001798 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
6001799 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
6001800 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
6001801 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6001802 i know theres no one who knows the subject matter that hes going to have to deal with better than john
6001803 his attitude toward the environment at pennfuture has been very angry
6001804 i think id characterize some of his views as extreme
6001805 theres no one i trust more than mary jo white in striking a balance
6001806 helped shape bills that were both tremendously positive for pennsylvania businesses and at the same time good for our environment
6001807 he starts off with some positives and starts off with a few negatives but i think he can work his way toward confirmation
6001808 i know exactly the difference between being an advocate in the private sector and having a public responsibility
6001809 whats important is working hard listening to everyone considering different views and trying to arrive at fair productive answers
6001810 view of economic development is through regulation litigation and taxation theyve supported so many taxes against our members i think the appointment is a concern for us
6001811 were certainly hopeful that the secretary designate despite the constituency he most recently represented will be able to shift gears and represent a broader constituency that includes us
6001812 all of these things are just incredibly expensive to the public while yielding almost no environmental benefit
6001813 if you cant compete with petroleum at 120 a barrel you cant compete
6001814 the whole concept of state government playing around in venture capital is nonsense
6001815 i think hes done an excellent job leading pennfuture and i think hell transfer all that experience and passion to his new position
6001816 diese frage k nnte innerhalb einer relativ kurzen zeit geregelt werden
6001817 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
6001818 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
6001819 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
6001820 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
6001821 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods
6001822 i look at the aspects of our ticket where were strongest and where were most in need of help and joe brings more to the ticket than any of the other people whose names are mentioned as finalists

6001825 we are in ohio in a significant way with a full operational staff with offices all across the state
6001826 weve been running television ads now for i believe seven weeks we view ohio as a very important part of our puzzle to get enough electoral votes to win the presidency for barack
6001827 there is no question that ohios electoral votes are critical to that victory
6001828 its always a major battleground state its really no different this year
6001829 ive been engaged in a lot of presidential campaigns during my life i have never seen a presidential campaign in ohio come anywhere close to where this campaign is organizationally and in terms of having actual man and woman power in the field
6001830 retailers are mature enough in this industry that they understand that consumers will visit their web sites before they ever visit the store

6001844 new jerseys tax and regulatory climate is already chasing jobs from this state
6001845 we should be looking at the concrete economic indicators that show our states economy is in trouble and we should be taking steps to help people who are losing jobs and being forced out of their homes by this states anti economic growth agenda not making matters worse
6001846 the good news from america most environmentalists are indeed leftists who support the redistribution of wealth and believe in a simpler lifestyle
6001847 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6001848 there are droughts in north and south carolina parts of california most of new zealand and this idiot who firmly believes he can induce rain by prayer is wasting it by asking his lord and savior to play a political prank its not boyish humor and youre a selfish hypocrite

6001859 at present it costs about 63 000 a year to keep a person in prison so dr patel certainly is costing the state rather less than if he were in prison
6001860 while i can understand people might have question marks about them these are the requirements of international treaties and we have no choice but to meet those obligations
6001861 i think its relatively modest certainly as i understand it its comparable to if not cheaper than what it would have been costing if bail had been denied
6001862 the thing we all need to remember and queenslanders should not forget that none of this expense would have been necessary if the labor government hadnt originally flown patel out of australia one way business class
6001863 she did not move and stacey went over and kicked her and she still did not move
6001864 he isnt really a republican and the only reason ill be voting mccain is hes the lesser of two evils

6001866 i couldnt expect anything more its a dream scenario i feel like part of the team because you have to have a medal these days
6001867 i feel like a completely different athlete from athens i enjoy it a lot more and am lucky to have people around me to help me improve
6001868 i honestly dont think id be here if it wasnt for steve peters
6001869 ive wanted this so badly id beaten everyone in the field so there was a lot pressure on me to win a medal im the golden girl of the track but i didnt think about the outcome i just tried to focus on the process
6001870 i didnt even allow myself to think about winning or failing i just focused on the training id done
6001871 take an active role to help secure a lasting settlement of the israeli palestinian conflict
6001872 its not enough for the next president to commit again to trying
6001873 to muster the political will for an intensive effort that brings the parties together hammers out their differences and brings about an agreement
6001874 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
6001875 oh my gosh the ice caps are melting and were all gonna die before lunch
6001876 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative
6001877 which is as textbook a case of the pot calling the kettle black as has ever been recorded
6001878 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
6001879 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful
6001880 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
6001881 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6001882 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
6001883 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
6001884 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
6001885 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
6001886 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
6001887 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
6001888 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
6001889 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
6001890 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
6001891 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
6001892 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
6001893 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
6001894 when our american friends tell us its the middle east which is the most likely area of proliferation and nuclear chemical and biological weapons theyre not
6001895 its asia that has the most potent latent capabilities to develop nuclear chemical and biological weapons
6001896 thats because of the advance of their economies and industrial base
6001897 japan goes nuclear only if it loses confidence in the american alliance
6001898 and if japan develops a nuclear weapon china would immediately proliferate a number of ballistic missiles and warheads and whats the betting south korea would develop a nuclear weapon
6001899 youve got no arms control or disarmament agreements worth talking about
6001900 i dont detect any great interest in the region to have this conversation
6001901 seemed to be a step backwards towards confusion rather than a progress towards resolution
6001902 i am really amazed that the nobel peace prize has been given on scientifically incorrect conclusions by people who are not geologists
6001903 the ipcc has actually become a closed circuit it doesnt listen to others it doesnt have open minds
6001904 when i put forward my points in the morning some ipcc official got up to say that what i was saying was nonsense see when we have that sort of attitude that sort of dogma against a scientific observation that would not actually end up in very very positive debate we should maintain our sense of proportion maintain our sense of objectivity allow a discussion not have fixed mindset about global warming
6001905 i think the scientific community is putting way too much faith on these models especially given the fact that they have not been able to predict 5 day weather forecasts yet and weather systems are simpler than the climate and every 5 days they have a chance to test the model and improve it
6001906 a lot of the predictions made by modelers and models do not match very well to the longer term geologic record and even more scary most atmospheric scientists are not aware of that
6001907 we know temperature goes up and down we know there is tremendous amount of natural variations but for how many years must the planet cool before we begin to understand we politicians and scientists that the planet is not warming for how many years must cooling go on
6001908 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
6001909 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
6001910 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
6001911 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
6001912 det skal du se efter n r du k ber flyverdragt
6001913 ebays move to court more fixed price sellers is likely to be just as controversial as its prior changes auction sellers have argued that ebay is
6001914 the vocal minority is going to be exceedingly vocal about this
6001915 i think it is a great step and for the fixed price sellers it is a big step
6001916 one of the companys boldest moves this year to boost merchandise for sale lure new buyers and take on competitors
6001917 the novelty of online auctions has waned and rivals like amazon have muscled in on its turf with strong fixed price offerings
6001918 web services enabled ebay to become what it is today
6001919 nick willis in athens was young bold and had a belief that he could just continue to improve and pull off the unexpected and in doing so took a couple of risks
6001920 i feel like i ran one of the greatest races of my life but because i was out in lane two for the last 800m which i ran in 1 48 i just didnt have it the last 50m and the guy dipped me
6001921 last night i guess the risk was more of a passive one whereas in athens it was more of a risk where i took it to them
6001922 here my risk was that i was confident in my ability to come through later on and that if i had composure a gap would eventually open
6001923 there are times when you have to make a decision to sacrifice distance and get out of a position but often you dont need to do that in the first half of the race you can wait for that chance in the last 500 600m
6001924 i feel a lot of results came from other people not performing i could name seven or eight guys that didnt perform anywhere near what they should have
6001925 its three races and somehow you have to get to the final with enough mental and physical energy in reserve so you can have that very best race in the final
6001926 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6001927 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6001928 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6001929 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6001930 mudgee is currently the fastest growing coal producing region in nsw
6001931 if planned expansion of the three mines ulan wilpinjong and moolarben goes ahead there will be between forty and fifty million tonnes of coal produced per year from this area
6001932 there is two and a half tonnes of co2 produced from every tonne of coal which means the mudgee region could be responsible for the release of 150 million tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere
6001933 it creates severe subsidence and interferes with the ground water system
6001934 subsidence can also initiate tremors which can be the equivalent of small earthquakes
6001935 we want to extend the goulburn river national park to include the drip gorge and land currently held in lease by the moolarben mine
6001936 when you see the enormous devastation caused to a pristine environment by coal mining companies its outrageous enough
6001937 but when you convert the practice into greenhouse gas emissions its terrifying and australia is one of the biggest emitters in the world
6001938 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
6001939 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill
6001940 nixon was bad enough without fictionalizing him and demonizing him
6001941 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
6001942 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
6001943 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
6001944 pay any price bear any burden in the defense of liberty
6001945 there is no question there is a lot more excitement in our state for sen obama than there is for sen mccain r ariz
6001946 sen obama is seen as a huge breath of fresh air
6001947 well be focusing on the continuation of the last eight years and more of the same
6001948 i need to focus on my re election and he needs to focus on his campaign
6001949 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
6001950 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
6001951 bidens son is a lawyer who would be nowhere near the front lines
6001952 for mccains son it was either the army or jail thats why mccain rarely mentions he son in iraq
6001953 i didnt decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms i believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism in truth i wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president
6001954 why is chelsea clinton so ugly because her father is janet reno

6001959 competing at the olympics was every bit as good as i dreamt it would be and i feel so lucky to win a medal in my first olympics
6001960 its definitely given me the taste for doing more olympics in the future i want to win a gold medal in london
6001961 the whole experience was unbelievable it is something that i will never forget in fact it was even better than i had imagined
6001962 tankers town will be too old by the time of the london olympics so the search starts for another impressive horse which means searching for an owner and sponsors
6001963 he felt very settled in the dressage and i think that the judges might have been a little more generous with their marks
6001964 he was superb in the cross country and was very tired when he ran out the second last fence 20 point penalty i was very chuffed with him it was a very brave and honest ride on a very difficult course which was fast and furious
6001965 some people said that the course was too short but the horses were all very tired at the end in the hot conditions so i think it was about right
6001966 the jumping was an exciting finale again tankers town jumped so well
6001967 we were all the centre of attention in hong kong and we certainly felt very much a part of the olympics
6001968 we didnt feel separate in any way the weather and fantastic and the competition was brilliant
6001969 although i was making my olympics debut i was able to get loads of advice from the more experienced members of the team especially mary king and william fox pitt
6001970 i had millions of questions to ask them and i learnt a lot about how i can improve suffolk homes
6001971 but she made it very clear shes really not counting on it and she was urging all of her supporters to get beyond the speculation
6001972 it would be such a shocker at this point because so many people have written it off
6001973 im not saying its what he would do but if he has quietly kept her in the mix it would have a powerful effect to kind of come out of the blue
6001974 rachel is brilliant it looks as if she could go far on the show
6001975 she has got past boot camp and the next stage will be the judges houses which we will film in a few weeks time
6001976 thats when the four judges pick their final three and those 12 go through to the live shows so rachel is in with a great shot of making it
6001977 i know i took drugs and i know i committed crimes
6001978 die vorgeschlagene richtlinie zur verl ngerung der schutzfrist wird kreativit t und innovation in europa irreparablen schaden zuf gen

6001980 by addressing the connection between the health of our children and the health of the environment we strive to make a difference for both
6001981 to that end naturalpath media is the perfect partner for bringing relevant advertising and sponsorship support that aligns with our values and community at drgreene com

6001984 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6001985 they told me there are going to be resources here
6001986 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6001987 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6001988 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6001989 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6001990 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6001991 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6001992 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6001993 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6001994 were on the brink of a financial meltdown i o u s a boldly examines the rapidly growing national debt and its consequences for the united states and its citizens
6001995 our nation suffers from a fiscal cancer that threatens the future economic well being of our country children and grandchildren
6001996 this isnt just a financial issue its a moral issue it is immoral to keep kicking this can down the road for younger generations to grapple with its time for real action rather than more rhetoric
6001997 i o u s a live with warren buffett pete peterson amp dave walker
6001998 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
6001999 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
6002000 this generation of prosperity had put millions of americans in new homes and millions of new cars on our roads
6002001 president richard nixon also called for greater efficiency standards at the federal level and for exploration of energy using the best options they had at the time extracting oil from shale and tar sands and developing cleaner coal technology
6002002 but when the same demagogues in the middle east who created the supply shortage decided to increase supply once again all the initiatives to use less and produce more energy were abandoned now 36 years later we again face a crisis an oil crisis a carbon crisis and a conservation crisis
6002003 the vehicles we drive have gotten bigger heavier and less efficient our homes have gotten larger and require ever more power to heat and cool our lives have become filled with new technologies that have changed the world for the better but increased the thirst for greater quantities of energy
6002004 this emergency far more complex than the one we faced three and a half decades ago harms our economy threatens our national security and pollutes to our environment
6002005 we are here today to accept the challenge of creating a clean energy revolution
6002006 the imperative is to end the drain of the american treasury both public and private which flow to the hands of volatile governments who control the worlds oil supply ultimately our vision is to bequeath to our children and our childrens children the livable planet that they deserve
6002007 if past is prologue and it is we know that this clean energy revolution will be complicated
6002008 so here in las vegas on august 19 2008 we are gathered gathered to share what we know where we are and what we do next
6002009 today in nevada there are 57 operating renewable energy projects producing 400 megawatts of electricity
6002010 our host the university of nevada las vegas is known for its high energy basketball and in the future it will be known as the leader in clean energy
6002011 look to nearby nellis air force base and you will find the worlds largest photovoltaic plant which provides more than 25 percent of the bases power
6002012 the first geothermal plant in america was built in nevada in 1984
6002013 unfortunately further work this year has been blocked by those creating a distraction by insisting that we talk about nothing but coastal drilling
6002014 even then it will be a drop in the global bucket
6002015 when people in the future look upon the polluted world of 2008 they will see a partnership of two politically differing individuals who came together to show responsible leadership
6002016 oil will be one part of our energy puzzle for years to come as we develop and produce the technologies that will one day render it unnecessary
6002017 congress should pass a long term extension of tax incentives for private sector entrepreneurs who are standing by ready to invest billions of dollars in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects
6002018 all of this will happen if we grasp the enormous economic opportunity this shift to renewables will create
6002019 for example if just 20 percent of our nations power came from renewables by 2020 we would create hundreds of thousands of direct jobs and save consumers many billions of dollars in lower bills
6002020 if we choose to embrace this challenge we can fundamentally change our world which will benefit every creature and person that inhabits it
6002021 we are taking the results and recommendations of this energy summit to the democratic and republican national conventions
6002022 and when we meet again next year i have every expectation that we will do so with a president a congress and a nation finally ready to fully embrace the great energy opportunities that lie ahead
6002023 in the olympics we recognize that its possible for two competitors to both be perfect 10s a judge who feels that way can give both athletes the top score americans dont have that option in the voting booth even if you like two candidates you can vote for only one this is the root of the spoiler effect whenever two candidates base of support overlaps like al gore and ralph nader in 2000 voters who like both have to choose one and sometimes that prevents the most popular candidate from winning its happened at least five times in u s presidential elections one possible reform is to use a rating system much like that used in the olympics some have criticized scoring systems as complicated but people use them online all the time now rating videos and books on youtube and amazon both computer simulations and some real world trials have made a strong case that rating systems do the best job of reflecting voter sentiment
6002024 no matter when such election reforms are more widely enacted theres no good reason why pollsters shouldnt conduct some polls giving people greater choices right now

6002028 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
6002029 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
6002030 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
6002031 we confront more than the usual number of people who dont respond or cant respond people are away from their homes heading back from summer vacation or preparing their children for the start of the school year
6002032 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
6002033 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less
6002034 educate citizens on the hot air in the energy and global warming debates
6002035 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
6002036 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
6002037 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety
6002038 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
6002039 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
6002040 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
6002041 this has to be the tackiest soap story of all time duncan was horrified his character has casual sex ends up getting crabs and is seen scratching himself in the corner shop
6002042 how can this possibly be suitable for a 7pm audience
6002043 some people are so unhappy they are seriously thinking of throwing in the towel
6002044 also known as the fallacy of negation or the false dilemma this is the tendency to dichotomize the world so that if you discredit one position the observer is forced to accept the other
6002045 doomed to be buried in archives leaving behind nothing but the living results2
6002046 der kampf gegen hochresistente erreger ist mit den bisherigen mitteln wie dem einsatz immer neuer antibiotika und intensiver desinfektionsma nahmen nicht zu gewinnen wir m ssen neue wege gehen um das gefahrenpotential f r unsere patienten zu reduzieren

6002050 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6002051 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6002052 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6002053 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6002054 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6002055 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6002056 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6002057 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6002058 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6002059 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6002060 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6002061 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6002062 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6002063 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6002064 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
6002065 whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
6002066 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
6002067 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
6002068 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
6002069 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
6002070 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
6002071 for eight years weve had a vice president who stayed in undisclosed locations trust me its already change we can believe in its just the next vice presidents identity thats undisclosed
6002072 the institutional culture of corruption embraced by the clinton leadership of the democratic party
6002073 unaccountable power for the clintons at the expense of the rule of law and respect for the constitutional processes of government
6002074 especially since it was days after she said she wouldnt take any more money from me
6002075 sen obama needs someone experienced in foreign policy and or running a state or corporation joe biden would be good
6002076 she has the perfect place for a republican platform the washingtonpost com
6002077 if sen barack obama should choose hillary clinton i will stay home on election day and i am not alone
6002078 theres a sucker born every minute and they are all hillary supporters
6002079 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6002080 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6002081 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6002082 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6002083 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6002084 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
6002085 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
6002086 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
6002087 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
6002088 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6002089 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6002090 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
6002091 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
6002092 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
6002093 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
6002094 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
6002095 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
6002096 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
6002097 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6002098 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6002099 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
6002100 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
6002101 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
6002102 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
6002103 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
6002104 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
6002105 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
6002106 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
6002107 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6002108 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
6002109 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
6002110 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
6002111 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6002112 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
6002113 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
6002114 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
6002115 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
6002116 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
6002117 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
6002118 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
6002119 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
6002120 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
6002121 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
6002122 what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive
6002123 a lot of companies are unaware of where their catalogue paper comes from
6002124 we want to work with them and pressure them to do the right thing by adopting sustainable policies
6002125 at first they werent responsive but then they saw how it would benefit them
6002126 consumer opinion has a lot of power to influence companies
6002127 we continue to work within the supply chain to promote certification of forests and fibre and we are engaged with our suppliers to continuously improve on our prudent use of natural resources
6002128 sears has yet to make any policy changes so well continue to lobby them
6002129 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
6002130 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
6002131 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
6002132 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
6002133 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
6002134 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
6002135 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
6002136 considering what the current neo con president has actually succeeded in doing to the balance of power between the branches which far supasses fdrs now feeble looking attempts
6002137 bush has gotten away with dispicable acts that any civilized democracy should not tolerate

6002141 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to go to university
6002142 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
6002143 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
6002144 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
6002145 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
6002146 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
6002147 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
6002148 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
6002149 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
6002150 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
6002151 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
6002152 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
6002153 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
6002154 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
6002155 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
6002156 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
6002157 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
6002158 this has been a difficult year for most of us in many different ways
6002159 the votes going to be tight theres no denying that
6002160 i really think there are enough people who i dont want to say fear barack obama but just dont know him and will end up voting for mccain
6002161 hes focused about the workers and what he wants for our future
6002162 we see him on the news but we dont pay much attention to him
6002163 our nation suffers from a fiscal cancer that threatens the future economic well being of our country children and grandchildren
6002164 this isnt just a financial issue its a moral issue it is immoral to keep kicking this can down the road for younger generations to grapple with its time for real action rather than more rhetoric
6002165 the challenge for west virginia the challenge for coal producing states and nations is that as historically produced coal is a dirty fuel and is regarded as a dirty fuel
6002166 and there are environmental issues associated with the production and consumption of coal
6002167 if you want to do energy well in an environmentally sound fashion go to west virginia go to appalachia
6002168 we all win in that equation thats our great opportunity
6002169 the physically reality is that we cannot bridge to the future for decades if not hundreds of years without coal as part of the equation
6002170 if you accept that premise then your choices are how do we do coal well how do we do coal clean how do we capture the opportunities for coal
6002171 carbon sequestration is going to double the cost of coal fired power
6002172 one of the coal presidents said it is at least 15 maybe 20 years away from being commercially viable
6002173 there are a myriad of legal issues that are unresolved whos going to take the liability if it comes back out of the ground and the energy it takes ive heard estimates it could take 15 or 20 of the power of the power plant makes to strip out the co 2 thats going to raise the cost of electricity
6002174 im not sure that we can really appease the individuals that want to see coal eliminated abolished from the energy mix of this country
6002175 but those individuals and groups that have concerns about the environment or the impacts of mining certainly we can be more responsive to those concerns
6002176 right now we dont have a comprehensive bill out there
6002177 we havent been allowed to vote on anything that i think is going to address high gasoline prices and dependence on foreign oil and any time we do get something its a fight to get anything related to coal in there
6002178 it just means were starting to do things in the right way
6002179 were making less mistakes were starting to believe in what were doing it just validates the work that weve done its good but still theres a long ways to go its just nice to be there right now
6002180 i dont think weve played particularly bad in any of these games but tonight was one bad inning
6002181 we set the table for them and cracked it open further with an error and those guys capped it off with a hit we just didnt get it done late weve been doing a terrific job of that but not tonight
6002182 weve been pitching well its just at the end we cracked the door for them and let them win
6002183 its frustrating because we didnt play well enough certainly in the eighth inning theres not much more you can say about it
6002184 deposit pricing pressure has intensified while asset margin expansion has been muted as banks are all chasing the same low risk borrowers
6002185 our concern is that the second quarter margin uptick could prove ephemeral
6002186 well ah ah i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective
6002187 answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
6002188 this is something that i have not i think come to a firm resolution on i think its very hard to know what that means when life begins is it when a cell separates is it when the soul stirs so i dont presume to know the answer to that question what i know as ive said before is that there is something extraordinarily powerful about potential life and that has a moral weight to it that we take into consideration when were having these debates
6002189 im not sure if there are human beings in there but go ahead and blow it up
6002190 it just means were starting to do things in the right way
6002191 were making less mistakes were starting to believe in what were doing it just validates the work that weve done its good but still theres a long ways to go its just nice to be there right now
6002192 i dont think weve played particularly bad in any of these games but tonight was one bad inning
6002193 we set the table for them and cracked it open further with an error and those guys capped it off with a hit we just didnt get it done late weve been doing a terrific job of that but not tonight
6002194 weve been pitching well its just at the end we cracked the door for them and let them win
6002195 its frustrating because we didnt play well enough certainly in the eighth inning theres not much more you can say about it

6002205 if we didnt have this physical demand i think gold would be much much lower
6002206 this settlement was reached without any admission of liability on behalf of the city and the individual defendants
6002207 although defendants believe that they would ultimately have prevailed at a trial the costs of going forward weighed in favor of a settlement at this time
6002208 estoy contento por el resultado porque ganar unos cuartos en los juegos siempre es importante el partido contra croacia fue duro pero ahora estamos donde quer amos en las semifinales ol mpicas estoy feliz hemos disfrutado y ahora vamos a prepararnos para las semifinales que van a ser muy dif ciles
6002209 esperaba nuestra intensidad defensiva ante los croatas contra rivales de nivel hay que defender a tope desde el principio para imponer el ritmo empezar con una defensa as nos quita presi n en ataque nos permite marcar el ritmo y nos da mucha ventaja
6002210 ya sabemos como son los cuartos marcan un antes y un despu s en el campeonato si ganas llegas donde todo el mundo quiere estar en la lucha por las medallas pero si los pierdes te vas a casa
6002211 it is not a problem related to ethnicity or religion

6002242 i doubt if this charter change will happen and if this will happen this should happen only after the presidents term expires so it will not benefit her kasi pangit naman yun because it would not look good
6002243 i dont know why they are suspecting that the president will prolong her term i think its clear that charter change will only be implemented after 2010 so malayo malayo yun that is a remote possibility that accusation is all malicious
6002244 and secondly as far as im concerned all talks about changing the charter should only be taken in the context of the peace process

6002252 stars such as debbie harry patti smith and jane birkin had distinct looks and their own natural styles but madonna really entered into the fashion world her relationship with gaultier made her like the supermodels of the time its never a catwalk look its creating a whole new self and exploiting cultural references to get this self talked about in doing so she transformed herself into a brand
6002253 idolising her awareness of visual style her sensibilities her forever moving forward i never dreamed id get to work with her
6002254 you wouldnt see me and think there goes madonnas stylist my look is pretty low key lots of black nothing that screams fashion apart from the alert look on my face
6002255 the colours are very strong and theres that religious element going on as ever shes saying look at my body and why wouldnt she it must be olympic standard
6002256 as someone who has just turned 40 im really bored by being told whats right for a certain age we should wear what we want to wear madonnas body may be unique but we can all learn something from her spirit of transformation her attitude
6002257 no one else is able to do that reinvention and thats what fashion is

6002309 paul meanwhile was in desperate need of help of all sorts his health had been deteriorating in an operation that took place on the fourth floor of the apostolic palace in november of 1967 the pontiffs prostate gland was removed contrary to rumors there had been no metastasis more miseries of the mortal kind came from the extremely arthritic condition of pauls legs and from his cervical arthritis that last condition forced him to wear a stiff collar beneath his robes in order to lessen the pain a circumstance that saved his life during his visit to manila the kris wielded by the bolivian painter and would be papal assassin benjamin amor y mendoza was sharp enough to have severed pauls jugular veins as mendoza slashed twice once to the right and once to the left side of pauls neck had it not been for that stiff collar and the speed of pauls private secretary monsignore macchi who caught mendozas arm and slowed its force paul would have been killed as it was he was wounded slightly on both sides of the neck
6002310 again in 1590 the same pope sixtus v decided to change the name
6002311 you have to doff your hat or bow your head
6002312 really source of proof please science observation proves you wrong and a habitual chronic pathological liar as well
6002313 on june 12 1980 a third explosive eruption produced 25 feet of stratification that amazed geologists successive layers are traditionally thought to require long periods of time to form yet upwards of 100 layers accumulated mostly between the nighttime hours of 9 and 12 while a plume swiftly ascended nine miles above the mountain wave after wave of pyroclastic flows began hurtling out of the crater and down the north slope each dusting the valley below with another lamination measuring from a fraction of an inch to over a yard in thickness each took from a few seconds to a few minutes to form
6002314 geologist steven austin described these pyroclastic flows as ground hugging fluidized turbulent slurries of fine volcanic debris they moved down the mountainside at hurricane speeds and left deposits of 1000 degrees f one would expect each deposit to be homogenized amp thoroughly mixed remarkably these high velocity slurries of red hot ash and pumice separated into coarse and fine particles of perfectly defined layers such features follow laws governing flows demonstrated in laboratory sedimentation tanks
6002315 similar thin layering appears in the tapeats sandstones of the grand canyon
6002316 yup you could explain to me that you have observed first hand the layering in your septic tank too im sure there is an analogy here but it escapes me at the moment do tell what is the connection
6002317 i suppose you did read darwins radio your choice of reading materials reveals a lot dawkins specialties are fiction and fantasy not observable science his much acclaimed among fools weasel analogy was a complete fraud youre clutching at fables in a last ditch effort to avoid the conclusion that there is a god to whom you will answer one day youre not ready for that
6002318 hey bj antibiotics kill bacteria not viruses you cant kill viruses with antibiotics and viruses dont mutate in response to antibiotics theyre unaffected sheesh i would have thought you would get it the first time you were corrected your knowledge of science is pathetic and youre a very dense slow learner
6002319 so we have layer upon layer fair enough of varying thicknesses of pyroclastic flows why is that such a big deal and yet again i gave to remind you that such layers are not sedimentary
6002320 yah and bears make big potty in the woods so what are you still beating that one trick pony i regret to inform you but your hobbyhorse is dead
6002321 are you a complete freaking idjit the point is that the aggregates were not only layered but segregated according to aggregate size what you have at msh is 25 feet of finely layered segregated aggregates laid down in 3 hours not a long series of separate volcanic eruptions one ringy dingy two ringy dingy if you cant comprehend the material go back to the nursery and retrieve your binky
6002322 for anyone who just tuned in see 7 wonders of mount st helens
6002323 compare the fish pig and human embryos which animals are probably more closely related and why
6002324 they maybe layered but they formed as a result of volcanic activity so they are not sedimentary rocks sorry for shouting but hopefully it may sink in eventually
6002325 the reason it hasnt been discovered before is no right thinking paleontologist would do what mary did with her specimens we dont go to all this effort to dig this stuff out of the ground to then destroy it in acid
6002326 how many artifacts are needed to prove that man and dinosaur co existed it would seem to present a major difficulty for evolutionists to explain the representation in art or literature or in artifacts of recognizable species of dinosaurs by ancient men who supposely had never seen one alive one could surmise that perhaps they had merely come across fossils but surely they would not have had the necessary skills to assemble them and then to draw them or describe them as in life modern scientists have themselves occasionally placed the wrong heads on skeletons or combined the bones of more than one specimen this presents a problem if you believe in uniformism and evolution
6002327 actually crime is on the rise especially rape and murder it may still be low but for countries with small populations its a drastic increase on top of that scandinavia in particular norway has cultivated and spawned some powerful anti religious movements the black metal movement that grew to infamy in the 1990s hit the national newspapers with almost one hundred church burnings and espoused a venomously anti christian doctrine its adherents worshipped odin the norse gods and satan they wanted not only the continued decline of christianity but a revival of nordic paganism in addition scandinavia has a healthy population of laveyan satanists so there still religious the just don t follow the bible paganism has always been in scandinavian countries and its been on a sharp rise in the last 20 years santa clause is worshipped every year all over the world santa came from the scandinavian religions of old so there quite religious just not christian
6002328 why would i do that the bible goes all the way back to creation its not given by an angel of light
6002329 compare the fish pig and human embryos which animals are probably more closely related and why
6002330 your density amazes me both gas charged slurries which formed the msh strata and water charged slurries which formed the tapeats strata follow the same laws of physics i e they follow laws governing flows of fluidized turbulent slurries of debris demonstrated in laboratory sedimentation tanks the volcano has demonstrated that such formations can be formed rapidly a global flood would have produced tapeats in a brief time
6002331 the difference is that this demonstration of the behavior of fluidized turbulent slurries of debris at msh was a gas charged slurry while the flood was primarily a demonstration of the behavior and end results of water charged slurries on a much more massive scale the flood also involved the laying down of volcanic debris but the whole demonstration was inundated with water for a year so what happens when volcanic debris is thoroughly mixed with other types of aggregates and subjected to the conditions that have already been demonstrated in laboratory sedimentation tanks hm m m m would you not get the rapid formation of a great number of segregated layers of sedimentary rock in a very short period of time good grief man the ancient romans used volcanic sand and ash to make concrete doesnt that tell you anything
6002332 you also said they were living matter which they are not now that is an interesting hypothesis viruses which are not alive mutate therefore proving evolution in living things somebody help me with this i swear that somewhere i read that the flatworm was evolving faster than the human my thought then why are they still flatworms

6002334 how many artifacts are needed to prove that man and dinosaur co existed it would seem to present a major difficulty for evolutionists to explain the representation in art or literature or in artifacts of recognizable species of dinosaurs by ancient men who supposely had never seen one alive
6002335 one could surmise that perhaps they had merely come across fossils but surely they would not have had the necessary skills to assemble them and then to draw them or describe them as in life
6002336 modern scientists have themselves occasionally placed the wrong heads on skeletons or combined the bones of more than one specimen
6002337 ive got to say i was remarkably impressed by it such a 70s film i love the wandering nature of it and how funny it is at times and then how fraker swings wrecking balls in the direction of the mythology while giving it plentiful nods at the same time john barrys theme is glorious and i love how bondian it becomes when marvin is tracking down his enemy towards the end lee marvin jeanne moreau and jack palance are all fantastic

6002343 at present it costs about 63 000 a year to keep a person in prison so dr patel certainly is costing the state rather less than if he were in prison
6002344 while i can understand people might have question marks about them these are the requirements of international treaties and we have no choice but to meet those obligations
6002345 i think its relatively modest certainly as i understand it its comparable to if not cheaper than what it would have been costing if bail had been denied
6002346 the thing we all need to remember and queenslanders should not forget that none of this expense would have been necessary if the labor government hadnt originally flown patel out of australia one way business class

6002353 these excellent drill results from chisawa over a 2km strike length confirm our opinion that the kangaluwi copper project has the potential to develop as a world class copper asset and a company making project
6002354 the first two project areas we have tested namely kangaluwi and chisawa have both shown consistent mineralisation widths and grades at a favourable 30 to 40 degree angle of dip with mineralisation starting at surface and defined down to a depth of at least 200 metres

6002359 all who are involved will get gods wrath and curse and will be put in hell forever
6002360 but i was wondering why those who kill over 200 people are afraid of facing the death penalty themselves
6002361 i think if we have a review of the status of the death penalty we have to review the overall system of punishment because we dont want to see for example someone who is involved in a serious murder be freed before the age of 50 or below 50 and continue to be a problem for the society
6002362 the possibility of the death penalty being abolished has to be balanced with a more adequate system of punishment
6002363 im open for having this we are all quite open to discuss it

6002559 so far we have not seen any significant movement out of georgia

6002561 when you start invading smaller neighbours bombing civilian infrastructure going into villages and wreaking havoc and carrying out the wanton destruction of its infrastructure
6002562 attention russia i have given orders to the united states air force to gain air superiority over georgia airspace this should be accomplished within the hour we will shoot down any russia plane that our pilots find any russian anti aircraft batteries which lock onto and threaten our aircraft from within russia will also be destroyed once this air superiority is obtained we will be to immediately bomb all russia positions within the borders of georgia including the disputed providences which russia has attempted to seize so my advice to you is to get the heck out of dodge asap that is all

6002573 you know for as long as i can remember ive had memories
6002574 this is no longer 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia when a great power invaded a small neighbor and overthrew its government
6002575 the big difference which cant be overlooked is that the united states and the european union are intervening in the tensions between georgia and russia
6002576 in 1968 you couldnt say that about czechoslovakia washington and all of western europe accepted the situation as it was and they accepted the idea that czechoslovakia belonged to the soviet sphere of influence
6002577 yesterday on august 20th 1968 at around 11 p m forces from the soviet union the polish peoples republic the german democratic republic the hungarian peoples republic and the bulgarian peoples republic crossed the state border of the czechoslovak socialist republic
6002578 this happened without the knowledge of the czechoslovak president the head of the national assembly or the prime minister and the first secretary of the central committee of the communist party of czechoslovakia and its official bodies
6002579 in these small studios there were people from czechoslovak radio and they were broadcasting for a number of days underground
6002580 they were getting news from all over prague people destroyed the names of the streets on the walls of prague it was difficult for the soviets to know where they exactly were and that brodcasting continued for a number of days
6002581 i remember the most famous athlete emil zatopek he was going from one tank to another tank and he was discussing the situation with the soviet soldiers
6002582 some of them didnt feel well you could see it they expected people with weapons fighting and now they could see just regular people who were trying to persuade them that there was nothing going on against the soviet union or that someone here in czechoslovakia wanted to start a third world war it was fascinating it was fascinating what people were doing and there was unbelievable courage
6002583 its a big mistake that your newspapers and magazines dont write the truth
6002584 if they wrote the truth you wouldnt need to come here there is no counterrevolution here as your papers write
6002585 everybody in the country was asked this wonderful question do you agree or disagree with the brotherly help of the soviet union and the warsaw pact countries and you knew quite well what that meant
6002586 you could say well i thought that they shouldnt be doing it but i was wrong and i now agree with invasion and you could keep your job in case you were a party member you were still a party member
6002587 not only you but your kids eventually could not enroll into university and you were either expelled from the communist party or crossed out if you were crossed out you still had a chance eventually to rejoin the party but if you were expelled that was the end both my parents were expelled from the communist party
6002588 believe in yourself not in me who believes in you not in you who believes in me believe in you who believes in yourself believe in yourself
6002589 you find yourself in this place where you really get to find out what youre made of and what i found was that when i was at my time of greatest need there were people who appeared in my life and helped me through it

6002602 i recognized that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being
6002603 i feel now at 53 i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
6002604 i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
6002605 now thats a dosa i killed it in about 5 minutes too
6002606 the original was built in 1847 in quebec but this one was built about five years ago in kerry
6002607 in the 1840s it would have carried maybe 200 emigrants on each journey these would have been whole families and people in very poor circumstances
6002608 the bunks would have been very close together they would really be packed in like sardines and if the weather was right they would take turns coming on deck and getting some fresh air
6002609 as you can imagine it could get pretty fetid down there
6002610 the emigrants that came onto this ship were fed because that was included in their deal
6002611 no one ever died on this ship in fact its actually plus one because one woman had a child on board which is unique i imagine
6002612 and the trainees get a feel of what a famine ship was like and also the feel of a sailing ship
6002613 its a great opportunity and anyone who has taken part has always been very happy with it
6002614 were one of very few actual wooden sailing ships many of them now have steel hulls which are very efficient but this is one of very few such ships left
6002615 weve just come from galway and on wednesday well head for larne and then onto dublin on our tour of ireland

6002617 i suppose people think its just a fad or something and ill go and get a real job one day but no this is it
6002618 i think the wheel up on the very back was the best bit because i got to turn it around
6002619 i was a bit afraid it would actually turn the ship away but it was anchored down

6002625 the big cache and six cores will give customers a nice bump in performance
6002626 it looks like at least from the benchmarks were seeing that six core chips offer more performance than quad cores so yes customers are going to want them what we dont know is how much power the chips consume and how much heat they will dissipate and those are key concerns but all in all this is a pretty big advance in the state of the art and all the major vendors are on board
6002627 these chips outperform anything amd has and probably win on price performance too this could cut amds share of the server market considerably
6002628 intel doesnt have to crank up chip performance right now to thwart amd
6002629 their current products handily outperform amd on server products from my own research i can tell you that x86 server customers have moved away from amd and towards intel so intel didnt need to release this stuff now to catch up to amd or to top them but theyre doing it anyway just to keep the pressure up on amd and on themselves
6002630 if software cant take advantage of it what does it buy you
6002631 you still have software partitioning issues and when you put more cores on a chip you have to run it slower or increase the power consumption budget or thermal limitations

6002638 on average a feature team is about 40 developers across the windows 7 project
6002639 some have said that the windows team is just too big and that it has reached a size that causes engineering problems at the same time i might point out that just looking at the comments there is a pretty significant demand for a broad set of features and changes to windows
6002640 it takes a set of people to build windows and it is a big project the way that i look at this is that our job is to have the windows team be the right size that sounds cliche but what i mean by that is that the team is neither too large nor too small but is effectively managed so that the work of the team reflects the size of the team and you see the project as having the benefits we articulate

6002654 this is a good move for intel and its good for customers that intel is making the move
6002655 it will speed development of solid state drive ssd technology and drop the cost smaller pc manufacturers will be able to buy pre integrated ssd drives that will seamlessly slide right into current laptop and desktop designs which means no additional redesign or development cost
6002656 on the plus side they are faster smaller and can take less power they arent mechanical and are thus more reliable than regular hard drives
6002657 the downside is that currently they are more expensive over time the price of ssds will come down but i believe most users will eventually have systems that utilise both ssds and traditional hard drives a decent sized ssd will give a speed boost while the regular hard drive will store the bulk of the data

6002702 davids idea was to organically combine the ability of faceted browsing to drill down on a set of given items but then to use the faceted values as the new set of items thus sliding the faceted browsing window onto the selected set and make that the new point of view

6002714 the departure point of the donner party on april 15 1846 for their ill fated trip to california
6002715 at the talk randall munroe author of xkcd gave at google a little while back he explained that xkcd was an online handle he had developed based on a set of rules and then randomly generating sets of letters that conformed to them a few of the rules were cant must be an initialism not an acronym unpronounceable cant contain similar characters i l 1 0 o etc youtube vid of the talk http www youtube com watch v zjos0sv2a24 its an hour long but worth the watch if you havent seen it randall explains the origin of xkcd at 44 30 i wonder if one of the rules was that the sum of the position of the letters in the alphabet had to be 42
6002716 its all very new shes only just started telling friends and family
6002717 to completely circumvent logic in the place of religious belief is denying the very thing that makes you able to worship your brain
6002718 hey i had a talk with a dude who claimed to be the son of god and he said all these really profound things and performed miracles that i cant explain i cant prove hes the son of god but i have reason to believe he is
6002719 i read in a book about some guy 2 000 years ago who claims to have met someone who claims to be the son of god
6002720 what information source are you basing this assertion on it sounds like a ludicrous assertion as it runs counter to the multitude of evidence in favour of evolution
6002721 world is flat and 2000 years old them libril perfessers and egsperts aint no nuthin like mah pappy done teech me
6002722 horrible ideologies and insane rulers caused that harm not atheism
6002723 2 you dont have to believe in god to have a good sense of morality its a pretty simple thing to figure out in most cases what intentionally hurts others is bad what helps them is good
6002724 3 i dont need to believe in santa claus to have fun at christmas therefore i dont need another fake guy to believe in to have a good life
6002725 4 when you die you will also be dust you just dont know it or cant bring yourself to admit your inner doubts
6002726 5 to declare there is a god necessitates you know everything about the universe
6002727 given theres no evidence something as powerful as god exists its highly unlikely he does exist
6002728 1 they didnt kill because they were atheists you are confusing causation and coincidence hitler was actually a catholic not an atheist
6002729 2 so its better to have a cosmic policeman to ensure we do the right things rather than taking responsibility for our own actions
6002730 would all christians become rapists and murderers if god vanished one day of course not therefore god isnt required for moral guidance
6002731 3 youve pretty much hit this one on the head there is no objective meaning of life so get over it
6002732 4 what does comfort have to do with truth non sequitur
6002733 atheism is more commonly used to mean a lack of belief in god s that is looking at the evidence there is no reason to posit a god for the universe to exist much less the christian god
6002734 i am guessing that you do not believe in the existence of zeus bhaal cthulhu how can you be sure
6002735 i didnt say that atheism caused them to kill but their atheism gave them a moral green light to proceed to them there was no god to say otherwise its how they felt at the time and there was no moral impetus to stop since they created their own morality without guilt
6002736 such gods dont exist because their religious texts are hopelessly inconsistent and incohesive there is little if any information about them
6002737 atheism when you die you turn into dust and nothing matters ever again what a comforting thought think about that when you go to sleep tonight
6002738 first i do find it comforting anyone who thinks living forever is better than not being has never tried it im serious i cant think of anything worse than having to spend eternity with myself except maybe having to spend it with jimmyspaza
6002739 secondly christianity when you die you turn to dust and nothing matters again and you spent your life living a lie
6002740 god has a place of infinite happiness created for you
6002741 but at least the christian tried just in case im not going to chance it
6002742 see the atheist would have to be 100 accurate to be sheltered from his decision in the next life the christian may be somewhat wrong in his theology but only has to be a little bit right about god existing to make it
6002743 i dont want to believe that there isnt a magical man in the sky who thinks im special so ill ignore all reality in favor of my imaginary friend
6002744 look at all the evil perpetuated by atheists such as pol pot stalin mao tse tung and even hitler who was more a pagan than anything else
6002745 this human world of ours would be inconceivable without the practical existence of a religious belief
6002746 and the founder of christianity made no secret indeed of his estimation of the jewish people when he found it necessary he drove those enemies of the human race out of the temple of god
6002747 what we have to fight for is the freedom and independence of the fatherland so that our people may be enabled to fulfill the mission assigned to it by the creator
6002748 speak for yourself if you think that christians believe in god in order to assuage their fear of dying then you dont know many christians at all i think that you assume too much
6002749 without religion the scourge of aids and other stds would be controlled by a condom

6002758 it is appalling to me that people still want to invoke my fathers name five years after his death to ascribe beliefs ideals values and loyalties to him that cannot possibly be determined and to try to further their own agendas by doing so

6002764 glitter had been warned that he could legally only stay in the country for 12 hours my boss is getting impatient with him now
6002765 but that seems a poor option at the moment as the vietnamese authorities will probably just send him right back
6002766 pretty hard to imagine it would be legitimate for him to travel abroad again
6002767 i dont want any sex offenders in this country but the point is vietnamese officials have deported him to the uk so as we do whenever sex offenders return to this country we need to plan for what happens when people return
6002768 never mind his individual case anybody who is returning to the uk in these sorts of circumstances would be met at the airport by police officers would be served with an order which effectively puts them on to the sex offenders register
6002769 one of the things we have learned generally about sex offenders is they do want to travel to places where they can exploit children
6002770 if there is evidence the person is travelling abroad to abuse children we can get an order that stops them travelling there should be more of those
6002771 in every single case the court has to make the decision but this is the type of case where i find it pretty hard to imagine it is legitimate for him to travel abroad again

6003148 in every single case the court has to make the decision but this is the type of case where i find it pretty hard to imagine it is legitimate for him to travel abroad again
6003149 i think its right that we use police time to monitor sex offenders
6003150 if you are a british citizen you have the right to use the nhs whatever we think about an individual and this is a pretty despicable person
6003151 god am i happy to be leaving vietnam and that jail i should never have been in there it has been a nightmare every second i was set up thats all i will say

6003154 glitter had been warned that he could legally only stay in the country for 12 hours my boss is getting impatient with him now
6003155 but that seems a poor option at the moment as the vietnamese authorities will probably just send him right back
6003156 pretty hard to imagine it would be legitimate for him to travel abroad again
6003157 i dont want any sex offenders in this country but the point is vietnamese officials have deported him to the uk so as we do whenever sex offenders return to this country we need to plan for what happens when people return
6003158 never mind his individual case anybody who is returning to the uk in these sorts of circumstances would be met at the airport by police officers would be served with an order which effectively puts them on to the sex offenders register
6003159 one of the things we have learned generally about sex offenders is they do want to travel to places where they can exploit children
6003160 if there is evidence the person is travelling abroad to abuse children we can get an order that stops them travelling there should be more of those

6003167 we are like minded on the subject of pollution of the oceans and we had lots to talk about
6003168 i was desperately needing to meet up with somebody who could give me a re supply of water and no other vessel had been near enough
6003169 it was so good to have the water the weather is so hot and humid now that they might quite literally have saved my life
6003170 it was extremely exciting to see another human being in the middle of the ocean
6003171 we were missing seeing another face so that was wonderful
6003172 she needed water and we needed food it was a feeling of reciprocal altruism that is very basic to human nature this experience was one of the highlights of my life
6003173 the most ubiquitous trash out here is plastic and the most common i would say are fragments of plastic bags and water bottles

6003189 we ask that you and your staff will dedicate a portion of that sacred day to community service honoring the spirit of unity that brought our nation together in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks
6003190 it hardly mattered what political party we supported or whether we came from a red state or blue state
6003191 at that moment we were all human beings and it is important that we find a way each year on 9 11 to honor that spirit of togetherness and keep it alive
6003192 provide a nonpartisan forum for you to address the events of 9 11 and the importance of national service

6003213 a father his son and a friend of his son were sailing off the pacific coast
6003214 when a fast approaching storm blocked any attempt to get back to the shore the waves were so high that even though the father was an experienced sailor he could not keep the boat upright and the three were swept into the ocean as the boat capsized
6003215 grabbing a rescue line the father had to make the most excruciating decision of his life to which boy would he throw the other end of the life line
6003216 knew his son would step into eternity with jesus and he could not bear the thought of his sons friend stepping into an eternity without jesus
6003217 how great is the love of god that he should do the same for us our heavenly father sacrificed his only begotten son that we could be saved i urge you to accept his offer to rescue you and take a hold of the life line he is throwing out to you in this service
6003218 it sure isnt very realistic is it but im standing here today to tell you that story gives me a glimpse of what it must have been like for god to give up his son for me you see i was that father and your pastor is my sons friend
6003219 obviously i favor senator obamas energy positions and democrats have been by and large the more forward leaning actors
6003220 but john mccain has the best record of any republican running for president on the energy issue and on climate change
6003221 im very encouraged about where the presidential rhetoric is in this campaign

6003231 politicians who vote against such initiatives wont pay a price at the next election
6003232 environmentalists need to tap into the creative worlds of myth making even religion not to better sell narrow and technical policy proposals but rather to figure out who we are and who we need to be

6003239 over the past two months the situation has worsened and living conditions have deteriorated people have exhausted all their resources and are unable to feed themselves we must step up our response
6003240 there are more than 16 000 acutely malnourished children in damot gale and damot pulasa of whom 1 614 receive intensive care in therapeutic centres across the two regions the situation can only deteriorate if we are not able to intervene efficiently
6003241 do everything possible to ensure that the situation improves and that those responsible for these illegal actions are punished
6003242 the things which have the greatest value in use have frequently little or no value in exchange and on the contrary those which have the greatest value in exchange have frequently little or no value in use
6003243 the more there is of a commodity the less the relative desirability of its last little unit becomes even though its total usefulness grows as we get more of the commodity so it is obvious why a large amount of water has a low price

6003249 the bull mountain was once covered with lively trees but it is near the capital of a great state people came with their axes and choppers they cut the woods down and the mountain has lost its beauty yet even so the day air and the night air came to it rain and dew moistened it till here and there fresh sprouts began to grow but soon cattle and sheep came along and browsed on them and in the end the mountain became gaunt and bare as it is now and seeing it thus gaunt and bare people imagine that it was woodless from the start
6003250 the main problem with chinas political systen is that it does not permit the checks and balances necessary to supervise and regulate a capitalist society
6003251 cycling is a fantastic way to travel its good for the environment its good for the health and its good for the wallet
6003252 the opening of the redbridge centre could not have happened at a better time this being londons summer of cycling
6003253 so now theres no excuse because not only is this superb facility the place to come to practice your cycling skills and if you dont own a bike theyll lend you one just turn up and pedal
6003254 the lda is committed to delivering an 2012 legacy now and i am delighted by the amount of interest we have already had from young people wanting to use this centre
6003255 redbridge cycle circuit is an example of how the lda is working with the boroughs to deliver lasting benefits to london
6003256 we have helped everyone to relocate from the olympic park site including eastway cycle circuit which is being turned into the velopark after the games it will go back into community use meaning london will have a new cycling centre
6003257 it is encouraging to see the first practical example of the 2012 olympics ensuring a legacy site for one of our most successful sports this track will provide cycling opportunities for people with all levels of cycling ability and will be a truly accessible facility
6003258 british cycling is pleased to join the opening of the redbridge cycling centre which will provide a first class facility to encourage community and competition participation in cycling
6003259 the lda and british cycling have worked closely together to ensure that the best possible solution was found in the interim period between the closure of eastway and this opening and we look forward to a thriving coaching and competition scene here for many years to come
6003260 the gb cycling team in beijing are achieving incredible success and facilities such as the redbridge cycling centre will help the sport of cycling grow in the future and underpins the future success of our elite athletes
6003261 i am delighted to have this first class cycling facility in our borough of redbridge which i hope will be used by all residents of all ages
6003262 this is the first piece of olympic sporting legacy in london linked to the 2012 games and we hope it takes cycling to a new level not only is it an excellent example of our commitment to healthy lifestyles but we hope it will help potential olympians build on the success of the cyclists in beijing and go on to win medals in london 2012 i would also like to say well done to our cycling gb team they have had amazing success in beijing and we are proud of them all

6003264 its not ridiculous to try to reduce an active managers methodology to an index ben graham had laid out a number of specific formulas he used with a very specific methodology
6003265 graham developed a fantastic methodology which were trying to update and bring into a more contemporary format
6003266 were trying to apply advances in modern portfolio theory using the power of computers without disturbing the essence of grahams strategy
6003267 each of those general categories in some shape or form have some tie back to grahams approach to investing
6003268 some have clearer relationships than others but we didnt just willy nilly try to go out and re create how benjamin graham approached investing
6003269 this has been extremely challenging and tremendously rewarding its something were really proud about accomplishing
6003270 im a huge fan of ben graham i view him as one of the first quantitative managers
6003271 well probably see the same thing with an etf replicating the work of warren buffett at some point

6003273 adrian touched all who knew him were very proud of all his achievements in tragically such a short time kay and i hope that all adrians good work will be continued by all those who knew and loved him
6003274 adrian was a wonderful colleague and quite simply a brilliant journalist and we shall never forget him
6003275 he showed tremendous strength and courage throughout his illness to raise awareness of bone marrow donation and always conducted himself with dignity and good humour our thoughts are with the family and friends of this hugely inspirational young man
6003276 the courage to share his journey with us the sadness the toughness but especially the funny moments along the way
6003277 he has left the world a better place lives will be saved thanks to him and that is a truly amazing legacy
6003278 in the most precious moments when time was at a premium
6003279 we all knew it was inevitable but adrian managed to keep his blog so honest and upbeat that it almost felt like today would never come
6003280 im personally not religious but do believe that a person lives on by the impact they had on others and being remembered by them
6003281 there is no doubt that more people will go on the bone marrow register because of his work and as a result other people and their families will get a second chance at life the enormous spirit that adrian showed will have a true lasting legacy
6003282 rest in peace adrian no more suffering or illness now
6003283 our clients told us they want video but they needed help getting them done
6003284 do videos to get fewer applicants they are looking for fewer but higher quality candidates by giving them a realistic feel for the job they can eliminate the unqualified and the less than committed jobseekers
6003285 we try to educate the employer on what makes a good branding video
6003286 reflect on what the companys goals are what impression they want to make on jobseekers and to look at things from that perspective
6003287 as an employer youre giving jobseekers a look inside your doors
6003288 thats what our production teams work with an employer to accomplish
6003289 videos can be used in a bigger campaign by the company its not just an hr function but a marketing function for the whole company
6003290 for that reason no one who has good intentions toward us and toward the western world should be afraid of it
6003291 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 per cent
6003292 it was done by our web team who had a spare half an hour over the summer it was quite a light hearted petition and we thought it deserved a light hearted response
6003293 is not treating the obesity crisis with the seriousness it deserves
6003294 the only thing going down is the money spent to prevent this epidemic
6003295 there needs to be a sense of urgency and outright alarm
6003296 this is the fifth f as in fat report and each year we see more evidence that our nations obesity epidemic continues to gain speed and destructive force
6003297 a strategy alone is insufficient if resources are not placed behind it
6003298 we are not getting as many guests during this olympic period as everyone expected
6003299 maybe it is because more hotels have opened maybe its because hotels have greatly increased their room rates
6003300 the benefits of the number of people attending the games is expected to be largely offset by reduced business activity during the olympic period
6003301 it was more difficult to visit and come to the games because of visa issues
6003302 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future the question also is do they really have the resources the cash here
6003303 i think there is little question that the domestic automakers are somewhat strapped for resources and they have to go out and borrow money and stuff like that
6003304 whenever they have to do that it is difficult to come up with the same level of quality and the same level of customer satisfaction
6003305 were seeing very good improvement in the past few years with lincoln and mercury in a number of surveys
6003306 were working very hard and were getting good results to improve customer satisfaction
6003307 were making the necessary changes to ensure customer satisfaction for our chrysler jeep and dodge brands
6003308 we think that soon well see the same success in external metrics that were already seeing in internal metrics
6003309 the correction in the housing market has yet to find its bottom

6003313 some in the west speak as if we are dealing with a limited local conflict
6003314 but thats a mistake if the strait of hormuz between the united arab emirates and iran were closed oil prices would be at 400 a barrel overnight

6003329 we believe that separate owners would be more active than baa in exploiting existing opportunities
6003330 risks delaying that delivery of new runways and making better customer service less not more likely
6003331 here we are at gatwick airport it has suffered investment wise because baa has focused more on heathrow airport
6003332 there are problems here which go beyond the monopoly which are to do with regulation the way investment is managed the capacity at airports runway capacity and so forth and also more broadly just the absence of any kind of grand plan since baa was privatized more than two decades ago
6003333 with the utmost respect for everything that has been achieved it is no longer the time for tributes but to start a new era
6003334 we have to re enforce what has been achieved if we can and improve on it if possible
6003335 we experienced a very good spell with luis aragones with him we felt very united
6003336 everyone saw the connection that existed between the coach and players and we are going to try and do the same with the new coach
6003337 they are two coaches who have achieved great success and we hope that vicente emulates what he achieved at real madrid with the spanish national team
6003338 well probably see an italy with three attackers said lippi
6003339 but clearly that will depend on their resources in the defensive area
6003340 iaquinta is available hes fine confirmed lippi who also hinted that he could form part of the attacking trident together with alessandro del piero and alberto gilardino
6003341 i wont give the players the team until tomorrow morning however i am happy because even though it is only august 19 i have seen the squad working with intensity and focus
6003342 personally after five minutes of training yesterday it seemed to me that i had never left said lippi
6003343 for me it is a normal situation he told the austria fas official website www
6003344 but certainly it is a bit more difficult at the start

6003459 i read that lionel trilling essay you mentioned you really like trilling
6003460 i think hes very strange he says that nobody could like the heroine of mansfield park i like her then he goes on and on about how we modern people of today with our modern attitudes bitterly resent mansfield park because its heroine is virtuous whats wrong with a novel having a virtuous heroine
6003461 his point is that the novels premise theres something immoral in a group of young people putting on a play simply absurd
6003462 she sounds pretty unbearable but i havent read the book
6003463 you dont have to have read a book to have an opinion on it i havent read the bible either
6003464 none i dont read novels i prefer good literary criticism that way you get both the novelists ideas as well as the critics thinking with fiction i can never forget that none of it ever happened that its all just made up by the author

6003471 t creaste todas las cosas y a causa de tu voluntad existieron y fueron creadas
6003472 porque por l tenemos vida y nos movemos y existimos aun como ciertos poetas de entre ustedes han dicho porque tambi n somos linaje de l
6003473 y diciendo varones por qu hacen estas cosas nosotros tambi n somos humanos que tenemos sufrimientos igual que ustedes y les estamos declarando las buenas nuevas para que se vuelvan de estas cosas vanas al dios vivo que hizo el cielo y la tierra y el mar y todas las cosas que hay en ellos en las generaciones pasadas l permiti a todas las naciones seguir adelante en sus caminos aunque verdaderamente no se dej a s mismo sin testimonio por cuanto hizo bien d ndoles lluvias desde el cielo y pocas fruct feras llenando por completo sus corazones de alimento y de alegr a
6003474 esto es lo que ha dicho jehov tu recomprador el santo de israel yo jehov soy tu dios aquel que te ense a para que te beneficies a ti mismo aquel que te hace pisar en el camino en que debes andar
6003475 y al cabo de alg n tiempo aconteci que ca n procedi a traer algunos frutos del suelo como ofrenda a jehov
6003476 por qu est s enardecido de c lera y por qu se te ha deca do el semblante
6003477 m s tarde jehov dijo a ca n d nde est abel tu hermano
6003478 y en caso de que unos hombres luchen el uno con el otro y realmente lastimen a una mujer encinta y los hijos de ella efectivamente salgan pero no ocurra un accidente mortal a l sin falta ha de impon rsele el pago de da os conforme a lo que le imponga el due o de la mujer y l tiene que darlo por medio de los jueces pero si ocurre un accidente mortal entonces tienes que dar alma por alma
6003479 miren los hijos son una herencia de parte de jehov el fruto del vientre es un galard n
6003480 todo el que odia a su hermano es homicida y ustedes saben que ning n homicida tiene la vida eterna como cosa permanente en l
6003481 porque este es el mensaje que ustedes han o do desde el principio que debemos tener amor unos para con otros no como ca n que se origin del inicuo y degoll a su hermano y por qu causa lo degoll porque sus propias obras eran inicuas pero las de su hermano eran justas
6003482 estoy hablando en t rminos humanos a causa de la debilidad de su carne porque as como presentaron sus miembros como esclavos a la inmundicia y al desafuero con el desafuero en mira as ahora presenten sus miembros como esclavos a la justicia con la santidad en mira
6003483 por consiguiente les suplico por las compasiones de dios hermanos que presenten sus cuerpos como sacrificio vivo santo acepto a dios un servicio sagrado con su facultad de raciocinio
6003484 por lo tanto dado que tenemos estas promesas amados limpi monos de toda contaminaci n de la carne y del esp ritu perfeccionando la santidad en el temor de dios
6003485 jehov mismo examina al justo as como al inicuo y su alma ciertamente odia a cualquiera que ama la violencia
6003486 en caso de que edifiques una casa nueva entonces tienes que hacer un pretil o peque o muro a tu techo o azotea para que no coloques sobre tu casa culpa de sangre porque alguien llegara a caer de l
6003487 y jehov dios procedi a hacer largas prendas de vestir de piel para ad n y para su esposa y a vestirlos
6003488 todo animal moviente que est vivo puede servirles de alimento como en el caso de la vegetaci n verde de veras lo doy todo a ustedes
6003489 y en caso de que un toro acornee a un hombre o a una mujer y la persona en efecto muera el toro ha de ser apedreado sin falta pero su carne no ha de comerse y el due o del toro queda libre de castigo
6003490 el justo est cuidando del alma de su animal dom stico pero las misericordias de los inicuos son crueles
6003491 la sangre de tu hermano est clamando a m desde el suelo
6003492 todo animal moviente que est vivo puede servirles de alimento como en el caso de la vegetaci n verde de veras lo doy todo a ustedes
6003493 solo carne con su alma o vida su sangre no deben comer
6003494 al esp ritu santo y a nosotros mismos nos ha parecido bien no a adirles ninguna otra carga salvo estas cosas necesarias que sigan absteni ndose de cosas sacrificadas a dolos y de sangre y de cosas estranguladas animales no desangrados y de fornicaci n
6003495 en cuanto a los creyentes de entre las naciones hemos enviado aviso habiendo dictado nuestra decisi n de que se guarden de lo sacrificado a los dolos as como tambi n de la sangre y de lo estrangulado y de la fornicaci n
6003496 no se maravillen de esto porque viene la hora en que todos los que est n en las tumbas conmemorativas oir n su voz y saldr n los que hicieron cosas buenas a una resurrecci n de vida los que practicaron cosas viles a una resurrecci n de juicio
6003497 adem s sin fe es imposible ser le de buen agrado porque el que se acerca a dios tiene que creer que l existe y que llega a ser remunerador de los que le buscan sol citamente
6003498 el alma o la vida de la carne est en la sangre y yo mismo la he puesto sobre el altar para ustedes para hacer expiaci n por sus almas porque la sangre es lo que hace expiaci n
6003499 porque puesto que la ley tiene una sombra de las buenas cosas por venir pero no la sustancia misma de las cosas nunca pueden los hombres con los mismos sacrificios que ofrecen continuamente de a o en a o perfeccionar a los que se acercan
6003500 sin embargo cuando cristo vino como sumo sacerdote de las cosas buenas que han llegado a realizarse mediante la tienda m s grande y m s perfecta no hecha de manos es decir no de esta creaci n l entr no no con la sangre de machos cabr os y de torillos sino con su propia sangre una vez para siempre en el lugar santo y obtuvo liberaci n eterna para nosotros
6003501 as como el hijo del hombre no vino para que se le ministrara sino para ministrar y para dar su alma en rescate en cambio por muchos
6003502 porque tanto am dios al mundo que dio a su hijo unig nito para que todo el que ejerce fe en l no sea destruido sino que tenga vida eterna
6003503 porque ustedes saben que no fue con cosas corruptibles con plata u oro con lo que fueron librados de su forma de conducta infructuosa recibida por tradici n de sus antepasados m s bien fue con sangre preciosa como la de un cordero sin tacha e inmaculado s la de cristo
6003504 hijo del hombre atalaya es lo que te he hecho a la casa de israel y tienes que o r habla de mi boca y tienes que advertirles de mi parte cuando yo diga a alguien inicuo positivamente morir s y t realmente no le adviertas y hables para advertir al inicuo de su camino inicuo para conservarlo vivo por ser l inicuo en su error morir pero su sangre la reclamar de tu propia mano pero en cuanto a ti en caso de que hayas advertido a alguien inicuo y l realmente no se vuelva de su iniquidad y de su camino inicuo l mismo por su error morir pero en cuanto a ti habr s librado tu propia alma y cuando alguien justo se vuelva de su justicia y realmente haga injusticia y yo tenga que poner un tropiezo delante de l l mismo morir porque t no le advertiste por su pecado morir y sus hechos justos que l hizo no ser n recordados pero su sangre la reclamar de tu propia mano y en cuanto a ti en caso de que hayas advertido a alguien justo para que el justo no peque y l mismo realmente no peca sin falta l seguir viviendo porque se le hab a advertido y t mismo habr s librado tu propia alma
6003505 estoy limpio de la sangre de todo hombre porque no me he retra do de decirles todo el consejo de dios

6003509 very few older people are hunched over with a walking stick they are assuming everyone who is old looks like that and they dont
6003510 the motivation behind these signs to make drivers more careful of their speed in areas with residential care homes is positive however in practice a reduced speed limit in such areas as implemented in school districts would be a more welcome way to achieve this
6003511 they should pay more attention to the real concerns of older people rising taxes and soaring household bills

6003517 the uk has a rigorous system in place for managing child sex offenders which is among the toughest in the world
6003518 the changes im announcing today will strengthen that even further i want to see anyone who poses a threat to our children dealt with as firmly as possible
6003519 ive spoken to child protection experts and the police and they have told me that these changes will further restrict the ability of child sex offenders to harm children both here and overseas
6003520 i will legislate for these measures as soon as possible
6003521 these measures are a crucial step forward and should help clamp down on sex tourism
6003522 we have been consistently saying that when there is clear evidence a sex offender poses a risk the authorities must have effective powers to stop them from going abroad
6003523 but if they do travel there must be better systems in place to monitor and track their movements
6003524 the uk government has a crucial role to play in working more closely with other governments and police to keep sex offenders on the radar and bring those who commit sexual crimes against children to justice
6003525 these moves will help protect vulnerable children around the world from coming to harm at the hands of abusers
6003526 it is essential that we work as an international community to reach a point where there are no safe havens for those abusers and thus ensuring that a child no matter where they are growing up can be as safe as possible
6003527 pretty hard to imagine it would be legitimate for him to travel abroad again
6003528 i dont want any sex offenders in this country but the point is vietnamese officials have deported him to the uk so as we do whenever sex offenders return to this country we need to plan for what happens when people return
6003529 never mind his individual case anybody who is returning to the uk in these sorts of circumstances would be met at the airport by police officers would be served with an order which effectively puts them on to the sex offenders register
6003530 every parent thinks their son or daughter is special and we are no different
6003531 adrian touched all who knew him were very proud of all his achievements in tragically such a short time kay and i hope that all adrians good work will be continued by all those who knew and loved him
6003532 adrian was a wonderful colleague and quite simply a brilliant journalist and we shall never forget him
6003533 he showed tremendous strength and courage throughout his illness to raise awareness of bone marrow donation and always conducted himself with dignity and good humour our thoughts are with the family and friends of this hugely inspirational young man
6003534 the courage to share his journey with us the sadness the toughness but especially the funny moments along the way
6003535 he has left the world a better place lives will be saved thanks to him and that is a truly amazing legacy
6003536 in the most precious moments when time was at a premium
6003537 we all knew it was inevitable but adrian managed to keep his blog so honest and upbeat that it almost felt like today would never come
6003538 im personally not religious but do believe that a person lives on by the impact they had on others and being remembered by them
6003539 there is no doubt that more people will go on the bone marrow register because of his work and as a result other people and their families will get a second chance at life the enormous spirit that adrian showed will have a true lasting legacy
6003540 rest in peace adrian no more suffering or illness now

6003562 unser ungebrochen dynamisch verlaufendes neugesch ft und der im vergleich zu anderen instituten hohe anteil der kundenforderungen an der bilanzsumme von knapp 50 dokumentieren die enge verkn pfung der helaba mit der realwirtschaft und verdeutlichen das zukunftspotential einer integrierten universalbank der konzernweite ausgewogene mix aus retail und wholesale gesch ft bildet die stabile basis f r unsere operative ertragsst rke und hat sich auch in der finanzmarktkrise sehr bew hrt
6003563 aufgrund der zur ckhaltung zahlreicher banken im kundengesch ft konnten wir erfreulicherweise unsere marktchancen nutzen dabei haben wir im neugesch ft keinerlei abstriche an unserem konservativen risikoprofil und der fristenkongruenten refinanzierung vorgenommen
6003564 auch in schwierigen m rkten konnte die helaba ihr hervorragendes marktstanding bei den privaten und institutionellen investoren nutzen dabei haben wir von unserem guten rating und der performance der helaba in der finanzmarktkrise profitiert
6003565 angesichts der bonit tsm ssig unver ndert hohen qualit t des wertpapierbestandes des helaba konzerns stellen diese bewertungsbelastungen weitgehend wirtschaftliche reserven dar die bei f lligkeit in den n chsten jahren ertragswirksam anfallen wir sehen deshalb keinerlei notwendigkeit zu vorzeitigen bestandsver u erungen im handelsbuch und bei den finanzanlagen
6003566 die auswirkungen der finanzmarktkrise werden aus heutiger sicht zumindest bis in die erste jahresh lfte 2009 anhalten zudem bleibt abzuwarten ob und in welchem umfang die entwicklungen an den rohstoff und energiem rkten und die finanzmarktkrise auf die realwirtschaft mit negativen auswirkungen auf die kreditm rkte bergreifen sofern sich f r uns in der zweiten jahresh lfte keine zus tzlichen bewertungsbelastungen aus der finanzmarktkrise ergeben erwarten wir f r das gesamtjahr 2008 ein vorsteuer ergebnis von gut 300 mio euro

6003568 so spielberg went off and made indiana jones who i reckon to be a period james bond
6003569 for 2009 we will start supporting other markets outside of the us at 2 5ghz and in other spectrum profiles
6003570 its one of those chicken and egg situations its dependent on the development of networks how much coverage they have and what the underlying demand is
6003571 the big cache and six cores will give customers a nice bump in performance
6003572 it looks like at least from the benchmarks were seeing that six core chips offer more performance than quad cores so yes customers are going to want them what we dont know is how much power the chips consume and how much heat they will dissipate and those are key concerns but all in all this is a pretty big advance in the state of the art and all the major vendors are on board
6003573 these chips outperform anything amd has and probably win on price performance too this could cut amds share of the server market considerably
6003574 intel doesnt have to crank up chip performance right now to thwart amd
6003575 their current products handily outperform amd on server products from my own research i can tell you that x86 server customers have moved away from amd and towards intel so intel didnt need to release this stuff now to catch up to amd or to top them but theyre doing it anyway just to keep the pressure up on amd and on themselves
6003576 if software cant take advantage of it what does it buy you
6003577 you still have software partitioning issues and when you put more cores on a chip you have to run it slower or increase the power consumption budget or thermal limitations
6003578 this is a good move for intel and its good for customers that intel is making the move
6003579 it will speed development of solid state drive ssd technology and drop the cost smaller pc manufacturers will be able to buy pre integrated ssd drives that will seamlessly slide right into current laptop and desktop designs which means no additional redesign or development cost
6003580 on the plus side they are faster smaller and can take less power they arent mechanical and are thus more reliable than regular hard drives
6003581 the downside is that currently they are more expensive over time the price of ssds will come down but i believe most users will eventually have systems that utilise both ssds and traditional hard drives a decent sized ssd will give a speed boost while the regular hard drive will store the bulk of the data
6003582 in subsequent years we will see reduced growth but the fundamentals remain strong
6003583 emerging regions replacement of obsolete systems and some technology shifts are driving growth
6003584 this launch is just the start over time we will be expanding our offering even further with more suppliers who are at the forefront of laptop technology
6003585 this was an evolutionary change to the microsoft licensing that everyone expected
6003586 they introduced the kind of flexibility that you would expect for microsoft applications in virtual environments but its not all roses for certain customers
6003587 you dont have to have every target machine licensed ahead of time
6003588 we the undersigned petition the prime minister to adopt the hague declaration of the digital standards organisation
6003589 we call on the uk government to 1 procure only information technology that implements free and open standards 2 deliver e government services based exclusively on free and open standards 3 use only free and open digital standards in their own activities as adopted and proclaimed by the founders of the digital standards organization in the hague on 21 may 2008
6003590 open source software use within uk government version 2 0 28 october 2004
6003591 as a b to c company we have to have a better understanding of what our end users are using
6003592 one of the areas that we think will probably be most likely at this point is a partner for the project
6003593 and that would be on a joint venture arrangement of some sort
6003594 there are debt options that have been presented to us and those debt options are under a variety of terms but they would not cover the full quantum of the amount required
6003595 we have seen a significant inflationary environment everything from steel to concrete to labour
6003596 e n s estamos crescendo 7 1 um dos primeiros lugares em crescimento em todo o mundo
6003597 coisa que n o nos alegra nada s um dado da realidade
6003598 nos estados unidos o crescimento estimado para este ano de 0 e negativo o crescimento nalguns pa ses da europa

6003600 this was an evolutionary change to the microsoft licensing that everyone expected
6003601 they introduced the kind of flexibility that you would expect for microsoft applications in virtual environments but its not all roses for certain customers
6003602 you dont have to have every target machine licensed ahead of time
6003603 our goal is to provide a forum for focused collaboration to solve interesting and difficult performance problems tuneup gives developers deep visibility and relevant information to debug and improve the performance of their application and a community setting to collaborate with others to solve tough problems
6003604 theres a big difference between being open to approaches and proactively looking
6003605 people are being more conservative its better the devil you know theyre not going to change jobs on a like for like basis or because the new job pays slightly more in 2001 2002 it lost its strategic profile and there werent many sexy jobs since then there has been huge investment and once again there are not that many sexy jobs about
6003606 following an internal review bt believes it is necessary to revise the methodology it uses for estimating turnover for partial private circuits leased lines to other telecoms providers within these statements any revisions made in this area will not impact on the bt groups statutory financial results
6003607 should this timetable impact the setting of any price controls for partial private circuits and wholesale ethernet products bt accepts that such controls would have effect from 1 october retrospectively
6003608 ukcta is disappointed to learn that bt has uncovered problems within its regulatory financial statements relating to leased line circuits bts regulatory accounts are a cornerstone of the uks regulatory regime which ofcom use to set cost based wholesale prices as well as acting as a first order test that bt has complied with some of its most important regulatory obligations
6003609 as a result of bts announcement confidence in bts compliance with its regulatory obligations has been severely dented in particular it raises questions about the reliability of bts previous years regulatory accounts and whether bt will need to restate such regulatory accounts as well as whether there are other telecoms products that are affected
6003610 all the negative attacks from the mccain campaign seem to have been paying off
6003611 in every election its kind of like the worse of two
6003612 the uk has a rigorous system in place for managing child sex offenders which is among the toughest in the world
6003613 the changes im announcing today will strengthen that even further i want to see anyone who poses a threat to our children dealt with as firmly as possible
6003614 ive spoken to child protection experts and the police and they have told me that these changes will further restrict the ability of child sex offenders to harm children both here and overseas
6003615 i will legislate for these measures as soon as possible
6003616 these measures are a crucial step forward and should help clamp down on sex tourism
6003617 we have been consistently saying that when there is clear evidence a sex offender poses a risk the authorities must have effective powers to stop them from going abroad
6003618 but if they do travel there must be better systems in place to monitor and track their movements
6003619 the uk government has a crucial role to play in working more closely with other governments and police to keep sex offenders on the radar and bring those who commit sexual crimes against children to justice
6003620 these moves will help protect vulnerable children around the world from coming to harm at the hands of abusers
6003621 it is essential that we work as an international community to reach a point where there are no safe havens for those abusers and thus ensuring that a child no matter where they are growing up can be as safe as possible
6003622 pretty hard to imagine it would be legitimate for him to travel abroad again
6003623 i dont want any sex offenders in this country but the point is vietnamese officials have deported him to the uk so as we do whenever sex offenders return to this country we need to plan for what happens when people return
6003624 never mind his individual case anybody who is returning to the uk in these sorts of circumstances would be met at the airport by police officers would be served with an order which effectively puts them on to the sex offenders register
6003625 here are poems and stories to match every mood theres a russian folktale about the beautiful snow maiden who comes to life isaac bashevis singers story about a snowy evening in the village of chelm when the village elders decide a valuable treasure has fallen from the sky and a story from japan about a man who is rewarded for his kindness to six statues this diverse collection of stories and poems is sure to captivate so put on your parka pull on your boots and read about snow
6003626 those few are holding up the light for others to see until that time when others come to relieve them or until a light comes along shining so brightly that a lantern is no longer needed
6003627 als we na de kerst niet meteen die kerstboom hadden weggehaald zou de gemeente ernstige problemen kunnen hebben gehad met de bond voor het behoud van zielige kerstbomen
6003628 wat een schande ik hoop niet dat dit mijn kinderen zijn geweest die dit schandalige plan hebben bedacht
6003629 koffie moet koffie hebben maar mijn bedje ligt zo lekker
6003630 hebben jullie je moeder al gebeld niet oh dat zal ik dat dan maar snel doen als ik jullie was want dit gaan jullie cht niet overleven hoor
6003631 you only get to drink milk right now but when youre a big girl
6003632 you get to have macaroni and cheese from a fork and some day youll learn to walk and then run but you have to be careful or you might fall down and scrape your knee and then youll bleed but your blood has platelets that will make a scab and you wont bleed any more but you cant pick the scab or you will make it bleed again
6003633 my mother once saved a tiny white undershirt from the rag pile and kept it in her underwear drawer and sometimes she took it out and showed it to me and told me stories about when i was a baby
6003634 you already have a pet you have nineteen of them
6003635 daddy and i are allergic to cats and dogs they make him itch and me wheeze
6003636 they stink you have to change their cages and for what unresponsive vermin
6003637 i want no critter too big to flush down the toilet
6003638 yes you may have a hamster but only if you promise to be responsible for feeding and cage cleaning and accept that a hamsters lifespan is less than that of a guppy
6003639 oh i thought you were downstairs that cant be panny it sounds like a chainsaw
6003640 maybe she forgot to pack her cheeks before she left sooner or later shell come out to forage
6003641 we have a big emotional investment to protect it might be worth a trip to the vet
6003642 so it will be like i am singing to her forever
6003643 her grandma said that she never knew she could love a rodent and her grandpa never said he loved her but he did she is an angel now a furry little angel
6003644 thanks for trying to connect but my baby is no monkey from the jungle

6003647 it is a shame that something as noble and good as pepfar has become tainted by the ideological nonsense of the outgoing administration
6003648 it speaks volumes that president bush is certain to sign this bill with enthusiasm and to champion these same ideological provisions in the process
6003649 whom have i in heaven but you and there is nothing on earth that i desire besides you my flesh and my heart may fail but god is the strength of my heart and my portion forever
6003650 tried to hit him with the door to the store
6003651 talkin bout my generation getting new hampshires multi generational work force to work for you
6003652 its exciting to be part of the electoral process in our country
6003653 we had the opportunity to meet some of the athletes and it was a pleasure to see them wearing products we had created
6003654 this year we are exploring the needs of not only the defense establishment but of those facing civil aviation authorities and commercial service providers as well
6003655 when you talk about focusing on the big picture this is it
6003656 weve worked hard to create a forum that takes a more detailed look at the real issues facing those charged with trying to evolve defense and civil agencies into net centric frameworks
6003657 ive never seen anything like this before but its an interesting piece
6003658 it goes back to 1795 so were pleased to have it back
6003659 any time you can preserve historical artifacts its important to the city
6003660 we did have a poisonous plant but we removed it yesterday
6003661 it was brought to our attention by a resident peter smith principal went out and walked the grounds to make sure there were no others we acted quickly and removed it from the roots
6003662 when we had more livestock around the farmers got rid of it because it can poison all classes of livestock basically its a weed pull it out
6003663 it was not overrun at the school as it is in my yard but there was a humongous one taking over the side where the little kids play
6003664 i notified the school they just stood there with their mouths open they removed it immediately right next to the bush is a kitchenette set kids can play with there was a pile of the green berries inside
6003665 these are the kids who would put things in their mouths
6003666 i have a 2 year old silas and maura who is 7 silas got juice from the red berries on her hands
6003667 i can see out my bedroom window and it has overcome my bushes
6003668 i dont think people realize how dangerous it is when we pull it up theres a very putrid smell very pungent
6003669 i described it and no one had a clue what it was
6003670 theres also a credit crisis oil dealers wont be able to carry the load in winter any more and allow people to pay in the summer
6003671 if it seems too good to be true it probably is
6003672 and half the people in the commodities market have nothing to do with the oil industry we as a country do not know how much of this is going on
6003673 we dont know who the speculators are what if its a sovereign fund of iraq or iran it could be that theyre in there to injure the economy of the u s
6003674 put it in the roof you cant have too much insulation
6003675 there are thousands of american families suffering that will suffer ever more tens of thousands of soldiers suffering with disabilities and there are hundreds of thousands of iraqis who have died because of president bush
6003676 what im hoping is the city council will see that as an opportunity for this community to register its voice on the issue
6003677 there is no way the city of portsmouth could indict the president of united states regardless of how people felt about conduct
6003678 they haves violated the fundamental principles this country was founded on bush has for first time in history declared preemptive war
6003679 we torture people theres no getting around it we torture people and its wrong
6003680 i won this for her for friends and family but mostly for her
6003681 this is an opportunity ive wanted since i started wrestling at 5 25 years ago and its pretty sour to have on me
6003682 it happened so quick its just kind of a shock to me and its something ill deal with
6003683 i finished off the olympic games with to me the most perfect ending ever
6003684 to finally get the gold medal on my very last routine meant the world to me
6003685 we went out there and showed we are the best going 1 2 in the all around thats never been done by the united states the americans have never had 1 2 on beam before either and 2 3 on floor isnt too bad
6003686 four years ago we had a large failure and we blamed ourselves
6003687 i would never trade one of my silvers for gold
6003688 what i went through to get them is very special to me and really touched my heart
6003689 she came in with the possibility of winning a few gold medals and that hasnt happened we were running out of chances
6003690 i knew it wasnt quite my best routine but i knew it was enough for a medal but im really happy for shawn three silvers is kind of hard to take i couldnt be more proud of her
6003691 thats the great ending she was a little bit disappointed after the all around but she went all the way to the end i can appreciate that
6003692 to finally have a gold and be an olympic gold medalist its what everyone dreams of
6003693 i hit the floor and i looked at mark and said can you believe that just happened
6003694 he just got out of surgery had his triple bypass and is resting comfortably
6003695 we are most grateful for all of the prayers and support we have received
6003696 he came over for a couple of weeks a couple of years ago
6003697 i was glad he did it it was kind of an honor for us
6003698 he could run the bases he could hit for average he could hit for power he could hit your best pitch and he could hit your worst pitch i just tried to keep the ball in the ballpark against him sometimes it worked sometimes it didnt
6003699 reached out grabbed her bag and punched her in the face
6003700 there was no physical attempt to pull her into the vehicle
6003701 the damage was pretty much contained to the garage area it never got into the house
6003702 there was some smoke and heat damage within the garage but it was not a total loss
6003703 the fires are being caused by how these rags and the painting materials are being stored after their use
6003704 when they get in a closed container like a gas container the rags will heat up and spontaneously combust
6003705 one of the questions was what does this mean to me
6003706 it will not decrease property values in many cases it will enhance value
6003707 five units in less than an acre of land a contractor cant do that why should a special interest group get to do it that is discrimination
6003708 i like most of us want more work force affordable housing however this ordinance as proposed is not the answer
6003709 we can have a lot of discussions about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin which is where i think a lot of this discussion is going
6003710 the bottom line for me is that communities make decisions whether or not they want to be a welcoming place this is one of those decisions i hope you will allow this ordinance to be presented to the people and we can have these kinds of discussions
6003711 the real question is where you stand on zoning density do you prefer to keep york zoning exactly as it is or to provide a home for people who work in town
6003712 how very good and pleasant it is to live together as brothers and sisters in unity let us have unity and move this ordinance to the people to vote up or down
6003713 there are variants in the wording but this ordinance wants to build at a density of 3 000 square feet per unit
6003714 i keep saying yup we have to do something about the density but it the ordinance hasnt had the changes
6003715 if you dont make the changes dont expect to shout us down to vote for an ordinance that we or i speak for myself i dont agree with
6003716 it can be perceived as something that will change the character of our neighborhoods it can be perceived as detrimental
6003717 we really need paper products like tissues and toilet paper and baby food
6003718 there is a desperate need for food pantries in the area
6003719 the holidays seem to be when people start giving food but i say dont wait just for the holidays
6003720 you can see the great wall of china from the moon
6003721 obviously being pushed back is not what i want but at this juncture it needs to happen
6003722 thats what were trying to stay away from anytime theres something wrong with your arm a baseball player especially a pitcher you think of the worst first ive been kind of reassured by people that its not that
6003723 he slept on his arm the other night and he came in and felt some tingling in his fingertips
6003724 as far as pain goes its not that much pain at all with it its something weve monitored over time it hasnt ever festered until now
6003725 matryoshka russian nested doll painting workshop will be held from 10 a m to 1 p m saturday aug 23 332 2255
6003726 ms fletcher said she was driving west on banfield road
6003727 she said she put on her directional to turn and stopped for oncoming traffic she was then rear ended by the other vehicle
6003728 this is beyond the wheels coming off of the meat supply system
6003729 and the people caught in the train wreck are you and me and all of our neighbors
6003730 when reports say that there is a one in 400 chance that the package of ground beef you pick up at the supermarket will be tainted with a lethal bacterium the food safety system is no longer functioning and immediate radical steps must be taken
6003731 there are many theories as to why there has been such an unprecedented jump in e coli
6003732 it could be regulatory complacency better reporting or immigration sweeps that have left slaughterhouses empty of skilled workers
6003733 high oil prices may have led to an e coli producing diet for cattle the microbe itself may even be evolving to elude capture
6003734 these ideas need investigation and research so that real change can begin
6003735 there are a lot of very smart very dedicated professionals in the food safety community
6003736 they have spent their careers working toward a better food supply and that collective knowledge is available to design and implement change
6003737 we need our leaders to get on board and get the food safety train back on track
6003738 i think doing so well in the regional is the bigger accomplishment because the competition there is so much better than at the state level
6003739 i think good competition brings out the best in some kids and the competition there was awesome the kids really stepped it up when they had to i never thought wed get that far
6003740 that was a tough call because then the bases would have been loaded with one out
6003741 then the noose gets a little tighter on the pitcher
6003742 artisan breads pastries cookies and desserts techniques and recipes from the beach pea baking co
6003743 attest to the excellence of its bread the perfection of its cakes the irresistible appeal of its cookies and muffins
6003744 shall i treat you with the same respect that you treated me
6003745 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
6003746 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought
6003747 coupling the two you have slow growth with higher inflation
6003748 they saw people stickering our a b products in a nonuniform way all over the boxes and bar codes
6003749 their point nhdi is this is my property and youre defacing it
6003750 aids response seacoast has cooperated fully and will continue to cooperate with the portsmouth police department with respect to their ongoing investigation regarding jeremy jay semprebon a former employee of this agency
6003751 for over 20 years aids response seacoast has provided free services to those infected and affected by hiv aids we remain committed to providing the same level of services as well as providing education and prevention information to those within the communities we serve
6003752 prohibition from child care services of persons convicted of certain offenses
6003753 seeks to change the social climate for gay lesbian bisexual transgender queer and questioning youth in the n h seacoast region
6003754 not many chefs get to do this and i was lucky its a great team we have here
6003755 but then it was just because i was old enough to get a job
6003756 i got to cook at johns island club in florida wigwam in arizona and the american club in wisconsin
6003757 and this is just a few it was a great way to cook for fine resorts and learn regional cooking and well everything
6003758 you just have to love cooking to do this job
6003759 its a long day usually beginning at 7 a m and im here until 6 or 7 p m six days a week in summer
6003760 we try to make it very local and very seasonal
6003761 yesterday we had a haddock sandwich that was really popular
6003762 and keep it simple this is what we specialize in here
6003763 when we do go out i like sake in portsmouth
6003764 we have two young daughters so we like to get chinese takeaway i like asia in dover and china palace in rochester
6003765 keep it simple do what seems to work the best
6003766 when you mix too many ingredients together its just not going to come out as a clean tasting product
6003767 this is a great place for me now and i love it
6003768 i love that our kitchen has access to the customers a bit and our clientele are varied and appreciative it makes a big difference
6003769 you go out there and you want to prove people wrong and get better
6003770 hes a smart quarterback and we believe if hes out there that he can make the right reads and do what tom does out there
6003771 it wasnt really going to work out here the way that we had hoped and he had hoped
6003772 at the same time there are still a couple preseason games left and time before the season opener and i think there are some other teams that are looking for tight ends and maybe there is a better opportunity for him somewhere else
6003773 i obviously know that at the end of the day that the owner has the final say so on whether or not he wants to give a guy an opportunity or not
6003774 mike has wanted to give chris this opportunity and asks that we do the best job that we can to try to prepare him and get him ready to play football
6003775 the mri news actually was good the doctor told me that the mri side by side looked identical to the one they took in spring training
6003776 there is a little inflammation which they injected and prescribed rest so we dont have any long term concerns at the present time it just looks like something thats going to be facilitated by rest
6003777 as neither kittery nor wells ogunquit is in an approved configuration i believe there is an opportunity for the two school systems to explore combining central offices sharing resources and administering functions such as special education transportation facilities and maintenance from a single office through an rsu regional school unit or an aos alternative organizational structure
6003778 this would not be the first example of non contiguous units coming together
6003779 i have a real issue with this because the commissioner is forcing this on us and it wont save any money
6003780 i cant see spending any more time on this its not helping education its hurting it
6003781 im concerned that well go down this path again and not be any further ahead
6003782 the commissioner is holding wells out in order to fix kittery
6003783 it was done for political reasons and for budget reasons they tried to sell a program that didnt have the savings they promised
6003784 one payroll system for the state would have saved a heck of a lot more money than all this has
6003785 if the focus is on the money side it should have been kept on the money side
6003786 wells size allows them to be their own rsu or to be exempt from the consolidation requirement
6003787 im concerned that two weeks after the wells ogunquit combination falls through well get this same letter with another districts name in it
6003788 ive never seen anything like this before but its an interesting piece
6003789 it goes back to 1795 so were pleased to have it back
6003790 any time you can preserve historical artifacts its important to the city
6003791 we have never had a show on seafood fest weekend and we are looking forward to this great artist kicking things off
6003792 the festival is free before the show and we encourage everyone to come down early and try out some of the amazing food on display
6003793 the art of nancy cooper funk nature pets scenes of the kennebunks
6003794 if you can ride on a wave on some kind of craft thats surfing
6003795 all these enclaves of support are coming together for one purpose
6003796 to give back to these brave americans its going to be fun thats the essence of surfing
6003797 ms fletcher said she was driving west on banfield road
6003798 she said she put on her directional to turn and stopped for oncoming traffic she was then rear ended by the other vehicle
6003799 theres also a credit crisis oil dealers wont be able to carry the load in winter any more and allow people to pay in the summer

6003809 the bottom line for me is that communities make decisions whether or not they want to be a welcoming place this is one of those decisions i hope you will allow this ordinance to be presented to the people and we can have these kinds of discussions
6003810 the real question is where you stand on zoning density do you prefer to keep york zoning exactly as it is or to provide a home for people who work in town
6003811 how very good and pleasant it is to live together as brothers and sisters in unity let us have unity and move this ordinance to the people to vote up or down
6003812 there are variants in the wording but this ordinance wants to build at a density of 3 000 square feet per unit
6003813 i keep saying yup we have to do something about the density but it the ordinance hasnt had the changes
6003814 if you dont make the changes dont expect to shout us down to vote for an ordinance that we or i speak for myself i dont agree with
6003815 it can be perceived as something that will change the character of our neighborhoods it can be perceived as detrimental
6003816 we did have a poisonous plant but we removed it yesterday
6003817 it was brought to our attention by a resident peter smith principal went out and walked the grounds to make sure there were no others we acted quickly and removed it from the roots
6003818 when we had more livestock around the farmers got rid of it because it can poison all classes of livestock basically its a weed pull it out
6003819 it was not overrun at the school as it is in my yard but there was a humongous one taking over the side where the little kids play
6003820 i notified the school they just stood there with their mouths open they removed it immediately right next to the bush is a kitchenette set kids can play with there was a pile of the green berries inside
6003821 these are the kids who would put things in their mouths
6003822 i have a 2 year old silas and maura who is 7 silas got juice from the red berries on her hands
6003823 i can see out my bedroom window and it has overcome my bushes
6003824 i dont think people realize how dangerous it is when we pull it up theres a very putrid smell very pungent
6003825 i described it and no one had a clue what it was
6003826 there are thousands of american families suffering that will suffer ever more tens of thousands of soldiers suffering with disabilities and there are hundreds of thousands of iraqis who have died because of president bush
6003827 what im hoping is the city council will see that as an opportunity for this community to register its voice on the issue
6003828 there is no way the city of portsmouth could indict the president of united states regardless of how people felt about conduct
6003829 they haves violated the fundamental principles this country was founded on bush has for first time in history declared preemptive war
6003830 we torture people theres no getting around it we torture people and its wrong
6003831 the damage was pretty much contained to the garage area it never got into the house
6003832 there was some smoke and heat damage within the garage but it was not a total loss
6003833 the fires are being caused by how these rags and the painting materials are being stored after their use
6003834 when they get in a closed container like a gas container the rags will heat up and spontaneously combust
6003835 tried to hit him with the door to the store
6003836 we really need paper products like tissues and toilet paper and baby food
6003837 there is a desperate need for food pantries in the area
6003838 the holidays seem to be when people start giving food but i say dont wait just for the holidays
6003839 reached out grabbed her bag and punched her in the face
6003840 there was no physical attempt to pull her into the vehicle
6003841 theres also a credit crisis oil dealers wont be able to carry the load in winter any more and allow people to pay in the summer
6003842 if it seems too good to be true it probably is
6003843 and half the people in the commodities market have nothing to do with the oil industry we as a country do not know how much of this is going on
6003844 we dont know who the speculators are what if its a sovereign fund of iraq or iran it could be that theyre in there to injure the economy of the u s
6003845 put it in the roof you cant have too much insulation
6003846 my kids come into the apartment and they say its damp smelling
6003847 its a little better in the winter when the heats on but its all the time
6003848 i talked with patricia martine the director of the yha several times and she insisted there was no mold
6003849 yes at times they look at me like i dont know what im talking about at times they have not been responsive
6003850 im happy my experience has been nothing but good the office always responds when i call
6003851 one of the questions was what does this mean to me
6003852 it will not decrease property values in many cases it will enhance value
6003853 five units in less than an acre of land a contractor cant do that why should a special interest group get to do it that is discrimination
6003854 i like most of us want more work force affordable housing however this ordinance as proposed is not the answer
6003855 we can have a lot of discussions about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin which is where i think a lot of this discussion is going

6003859 there are variants in the wording but this ordinance wants to build at a density of 3 000 square feet per unit
6003860 i keep saying yup we have to do something about the density but it the ordinance hasnt had the changes
6003861 if you dont make the changes dont expect to shout us down to vote for an ordinance that we or i speak for myself i dont agree with
6003862 it can be perceived as something that will change the character of our neighborhoods it can be perceived as detrimental
6003863 i think i am just going to end it there dave spoke to many of the points i had
6003864 as neither kittery nor wells ogunquit is in an approved configuration i believe there is an opportunity for the two school systems to explore combining central offices sharing resources and administering functions such as special education transportation facilities and maintenance from a single office through an rsu regional school unit or an aos alternative organizational structure
6003865 this would not be the first example of non contiguous units coming together
6003866 i have a real issue with this because the commissioner is forcing this on us and it wont save any money
6003867 i cant see spending any more time on this its not helping education its hurting it
6003868 im concerned that well go down this path again and not be any further ahead
6003869 the commissioner is holding wells out in order to fix kittery
6003870 it was done for political reasons and for budget reasons they tried to sell a program that didnt have the savings they promised
6003871 one payroll system for the state would have saved a heck of a lot more money than all this has
6003872 if the focus is on the money side it should have been kept on the money side
6003873 wells size allows them to be their own rsu or to be exempt from the consolidation requirement
6003874 im concerned that two weeks after the wells ogunquit combination falls through well get this same letter with another districts name in it
6003875 reached out grabbed her bag and punched her in the face
6003876 there was no physical attempt to pull her into the vehicle
6003877 our vision of york beach is to make it an attractive friendly community center
6003878 it became clear that most of the objections came from residential people that abutted the businesses
6003879 the zoning doesnt match the pattern down there youve got a village thats over 100 years old theres an established pattern thats pedestrian oriented the goal is really to say we kind of like that pattern lets make that the institutionalized norm
6003880 it will substantially increase the revenue to the owner than what they see today
6003881 we needed to get a better handle on our stormwater
6003882 our information wasnt as accurate as we wanted it to be
6003883 the situation could have been a lot worse hes lucky
6003884 past experience shows these things get out of hand and people come who are not welcome
6003885 aids response seacoast has cooperated fully and will continue to cooperate with the portsmouth police department with respect to their ongoing investigation regarding jeremy jay semprebon a former employee of this agency

6003889 weve had at least four public hearings on the walgreens
6003890 one tree a year has died as more and more water got into my back yard
6003891 i certainly feel better as far as the impacts are concerned
6003892 i do think we have an interpretational slippery slope about when wetlands can be filled and when they cannot
6003893 the developers report insinuates that a company can just come in and fill a wetland and then just build another one in mitigation
6003894 this is what the planning board has approved in the past and we have to ask ourselves if there is a new standard now
6003895 because we help people to eat healthy and we dont have fried foods here
6003896 to be recognized by such an esteemed publication as healthcare marketing report and to have our work acknowledged in such a large pool of worthy competitors is a true honor
6003897 these awards only reinforce our commitment to producing creative cutting edge programs and materials for our members and clients
6003898 we are gratified by the overwhelming support our stockholders have provided with these approvals
6003899 these approvals are the first step in our strategy to create significant long term shareholder value by combining with oncogenex we believe that through joining forces with oncogenex we have broadened our product portfolio and enhanced our opportunity for future success on behalf of our board of directors i want to thank our stockholders and employees for their support throughout this process
6003900 i am extremely pleased with the vote of confidence displayed by both the sonus and oncogenex shareholders in approving this transaction the prospects of oncogenex pharmaceuticals are encouraging and i look forward to advancing our clinical programs for the ultimate benefit of cancer patients while also building value for our stockholders
6003901 we will take immediate action to reduce the combined companys burn rate while retaining our ability to execute on clinical milestones we expect that this action will extend our cash runway and maximize our available resources while retaining the resources and workforce necessary to advance our oncology pipeline

6003904 we have to work on transitioning the ball a little bit on defense and getting in the circle and scoring
6003905 this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone
6003906 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defense site that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of a long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6003907 both sides have achieved their goals this is a great success for poland
6003908 ive known her since i was an elementary school student but i had once defeated her in south korea so that made me feel a little pressure to win today

6004002 officials concerned are working through the process of putting him on the plane to take him out of the country but if he continues to refuse to leave then he will confined in the airport transit area temporarily before being taken into a detention centre
6004003 pretty hard to imagine it would be legitimate for him to travel abroad again
6004004 i dont want any sex offenders in this country but the point is vietnamese officials have deported him to the uk so as we do whenever sex offenders return to this country we need to plan for what happens when people return
6004005 never mind his individual case anybody who is returning to the uk in these sorts of circumstances would be met at the airport by police officers would be served with an order which effectively puts them on to the sex offenders register
6004006 one of the things we have learned generally about sex offenders is they do want to travel to places where they can exploit children
6004007 if there is evidence the person is travelling abroad to abuse children we can get an order that stops them travelling there should be more of those
6004008 in every single case the court has to make the decision but this is the type of case where i find it pretty hard to imagine it is legitimate for him to travel abroad again
6004009 i think its right that we use police time to monitor sex offenders
6004010 if you are a british citizen you have the right to use the nhs whatever we think about an individual and this is a pretty despicable person
6004011 the last information we have is that shortly before the flight to the uk departed he declined to board

6004023 the launch of this new website is a significant development in our campaign building on the brand and adding a depth of information to our advertising
6004024 the new website means that our effective and simple rallying call of get some pork on that fork can be supplemented with a wealth of information about scotlands world class production standards and enable people to make an informed choice to seek out specially selected pork
6004025 recent research shows that for a growing number of ethical consumers and particularly for pork animal welfare standards are an important driver for purchase
6004026 the new website means that our effective and simple rallying call of get some pork on that fork can be supplemented with a wealth of information about scotlands world class production standards and enable people to make an informed choice to seek out specially selected pork
6004027 the site also gives consumers the opportunity to sign up and be notified every time we release new recipes or run new campaigns and competitions its designed to be the home of all things pork on the net

6004032 if you know your site was infected dont you have an ethical responsibility to provide a warning shouldnt we change the rules so that the guy with a sexually transmitted disease has to say hes infecting people
6004033 if this were to prevent one breach of someones private data the good would have outweighed the expense
6004034 the real problem is that no one is fixing their sites
6004035 the same tens of thousands of sites get infected over and over with different malware using the same methods a few class action lawsuits could be a good incentive to fix this
6004036 should hundreds of millions of disclosure messages have gone out we dont want to create unnecessary noise or panic or distract from the messages that really matter
6004037 we have a real problem with hard data in our industry and we need a kind of statistical clearinghouse

6004060 learning mandarin is even harder than winning eight gold medals in the pool
6004061 its the hardest thing ive ever tried in my life
6004062 the language is so tough i started taking some chinese lessons soon after learning french and german after a while i could speak a little and understand a little
6004063 but all the words characters and pronunciations in mandarin are so different
6004064 investigation into the cases revealed that touting became rampant in the year 2006 2007 and so far the directorate has dealt with the reported cases decisively as all arrestees have been handed over to the nigeria police for prosecution the director asured members of the public that the directorate would not rest on its oars until faking of vehicle number plates and documents were eradicated adding that vehicle number is an issue of the state
6004065 there is no way a plate number belonging to sokoto state can be issued and processed in kaduna state for instance he advised members of the public who purchase fct plate numbers in lagos kaduna and some other states to desist from doing such as they could be patronising touts who will in turn dole out fake numbers plates to them
6004066 we wish to inform the efcc that before now our former member of the national house of representatives representing garki babura honorable nasiru garba dantiye complained about the same issue to the ministry of water resources as a result of which committee was set up to investigate the matter which they did and even visited us in various villages for verification but no action was taken
6004067 but he brought me here daka tsalle and introduced me to this mess and fled
6004068 what we do is to hand them over to the hisbah commander of that particular town and enroll them in schools
6004069 the archibubuilt forum will no doubt promote the development and use of locally sourced and tested building materials and construction technology in nigeria which will go a long way in bringing down construction costs and make housing more affordable to the majority of our poeple
6004070 for this trend to change our indigenous building material researchers and manufacturers and even representatives of foreign based material manufacturers must rise to the challenge of sourcing locally available raw materials and innovation which will meet established global standards
6004071 is a sad indication that rather than improving the standards of building construction standards are being compromised by the use of non professionals for profit for this very purpose the national building code was launched to arrest the rot

6004078 not as much income is coming in to support the infrastructure which will in turn either reduce our reserve capacity or else well have to slow down our capital improvement or on the other side increase water rates to subsidize it
6004079 weve probably used more in the club houses than we used on the courses
6004080 our revenues are based on flows but we have a contingency plan built into our budget

6004084 a neighbour was awoken by the womans screams and spotted a man leaving the flat through a window and contacted the police
6004085 it seemed like nothing was stolen as a laptop and cellphone were found lying on the floor

6004090 i am deeply saddened and angry that the executive promised to create a single flood emergency line following the crisis in june last year yet over a year later this has not been delivered this is a disgrace but unsurprising because we have come to expect that this executive will fail to deliver
6004091 they have now said that the floodline will be delivered in october alliance will be keeping an eye on this and will hold them to account if they do not create the service by them

6004108 im westen georgiens gab es kein zeichen eines r ckzugs russischer truppen die realit t im land macht das waffenstillstandsabkommen l cherlich allerdings k nnen weitere ultimaten gegen ber russland mehr schaden als n tzen
6004109 die zeit ist vorbei da russland in einer mischung aus versch chterung und bewunderung auf das europ ische modell geblickt hat russland ist sich seiner neuen potenz bewusst die dem land aus der tatsache erw chst dass es ber die kontrolle jener energiequellen verf gt die f r europa lebenswichtig sind
6004110 russlands intervention in georgien legte die schwierigkeiten offen die die usa die eu und die nato damit haben die immer st rker l dierte weltordnung aufrecht zu erhalten
6004111 das m chtigste milit rb ndnis der welt will nicht mit handfesten ma nahmen auf die russische machtdemonstration in georgien reagieren das ist kein spektakul rer aber ein kluger entscheid
6004112 das nato treffen erinnerte in seinen emotionen auch an eine gruppe jugendlicher die sich von einem rivalisierenden anf hrer herausgefordert f hlt einige mitglieder dampften geradezu vor zorn und emp rung ber russland andere versuchten zu beruhigen weil sie genau wissen dass ihre mittel begrenzt sind und sie dem starken widersacher ja ohnehin immer wieder ber den weg laufen und so kam also diese nato erkl rung zum kaukasus heraus eine wuchtige botschaft mit erhobener faust und doch keine wirkliche kampfansage
6004113 georgien mit seinen grenzen zu russland zum schwarzen meer und zur t rkei hat seit dem ende der sowjetunion als kernland der kaukasischen transitregion f r den transport von l und gas aus dem kaspischen becken und aus zentralasien eine berragende strategische bedeutung und zwar sowohl f r russland als auch f r die usa warum sonst betreiben die usa bereits seit mitte der 1990er jahre systematisch die aufr stung georgiens und seine einbindung in die nato auch russlands interessen an georgien existieren unabh ngig davon ob in moskau eine an demokratie und reformen orientierte regierung herrscht oder ein autokratisches regime
6004114 i en sak som den foreliggende der tiltalte og forn rmede fortsatt er kj rester er det ekstra uheldig at det har tatt s lang tid f saken opp for retten dette m medf re b de at straffens lengde reduseres noe og at deler gj res betinget
6004115 die aktuelle vcd auto umweltliste zeigt dass viele fahrzeuge auf dem markt sind die einen akzeptablen verbrauch haben und bei l rm und schadstoffen gut abschneiden autok ufer haben also die wahl wenn sie umweltschonend und sparsam unterwegs sein wollen
6004116 w hrend es gerade mal ein deutsches fabrikat unter die top ten schafft dominieren neun pkw aus deutschland klar die umweltbesten kompaktautos
6004117 wir hatten das fahrzeug in unser umweltranking aufgenommen weil uns die daimler ag verbindlich zugesichert hatte dass der diesel smart ab oktober endlich serienm ig mit einem geschlossenen partikelfilter gegen krankmachenden dieselru ausgeliefert wird
6004118 diese mogelpackung entspricht nicht dem stand der technik und unterl uft den notwendigen schutz der gesundheit insbesondere in ballungsgebieten niemand sollte den diesel smart ohne vollwertigen partikelfilter kaufen
6004119 it was important that we did play the game no matter where it was we have everything set out and the players were looking forward to the two games
6004120 at least we know we are playing that game and people are looking forward to that now
6004121 i know it is not in georgia but fifa have made the decision and we have to respect that
6004122 thats just the way it has worked out i dont think we will complain too much about it
6004123 it is a situation that has happened there thats go nothing to do with us
6004124 it is out of our hands and we have to respect the decision of fifa
6004125 but no matter where the game was we would have gone and played it anywhere because it is important for the group and it is important to get the three points
6004126 fifa today decided that the 2010 fifa world cup preliminary competition match between georgia and the republic of ireland scheduled for september 6 2008 will take place at a neutral venue due to recent events in georgia which have affected security in the entire country
6004127 fifa reached this decision after closely monitoring the situation in georgia and taking note that uefa also decided to ask georgian clubs involved in uefa competitions to play their matches in neutral countries
6004128 the georgian football federation has until august 26 2008 to nominate a neutral venue to host the qualifying match against the republic of ireland which will take place on the scheduled date of september 6 2008
6004129 the georgian football federation will serve as the host association for this match
6004130 we will await the fifa decision it would have been very difficult for us to play in georgia
6004131 for both teams not only for us the first game is very very important
6004132 i am sad about the situation but we cannot do anything about that it is important to respect the calendar
6004133 i am happy fifa has decided this i am sad for georgia but that is the situation
6004134 i would much rather do a home that has well thought out small spaces than big palatial ones
6004135 you can get a lot more mileage out of your dollar and pay attention to the accessorizing and dressing of a small space

6004144 you have to understand what makes the times unique among major american newspapers
6004145 alone among the countrys leading papers this one is simultaneously the most important news organization in a vast region the western united states the most influential source of news in the largest and most important state in the country and the hometown newspaper of one of the worlds greatest and most important cities at the same time it is a paper with a national and international reach because the size interests and sophistication of its local readership require those things finally the demographic realities of the worlds most ethnically and culturally diverse region dictate special obligations when it comes to coverage of latin america and the pacific rim
6004146 what we do in applying our great resources to our mission and business has to follow our vision of where we are taking the business over the next five years and beyond it is clear that some of this will require moving resources from print to online and other growth areas it also means continuing to reduce costs in the core print business across every area of the company and doing so thoughtfully and strategically
6004147 if the tribune co or its successor as owner of the los angeles times continues to reduce costs by cutting the papers staff in the interests of maintaining a profit margin of 20 or better then the only way to reinvigorate local coverage and to establish the kind of strong online presence that will guarantee the papers future is to stop doing something we now do for readers or to do it less thoroughly and less well hoping that those readers just wont mind nothing is impossible of course but some things are highly improbable
6004148 neither of whom ever has lived or worked in los angeles
6004149 if i think there is too much staff i will say so
6004150 and if i think there is not enough i will say that too
6004151 and that could be better for everybody here but dont kid yourself it could also be worse a lot worse
6004152 the tribune has evolved from potential savior to darth vader nothing less while 20 plus percent profit margins hardly raise an eyebrow in chicago those sorts of profits are recognized for what they are in la obscene and unnecessarily regressive if the studios could count on that kind of return on all their products well they know its impossible
6004153 not only will he tribune be despised within the walls of the building but also in the hollywood community which is blog happy and extremely vocal when it comes to its own well being as you know la is quite a bit more literate and media savvy than anyone in chicago gives it credit for being

6004161 the picture of a fully clothed model which appeared in a number of u k tabloid newspapers can hardly be deemed to be offensive when many of those same newspapers carry pictures of topless models and adverts for sex lines etc
6004162 its a core part of the ryanair brand even if michael oleary wouldnt express it exactly like that
6004163 there are a few occasions when people go tut tut but they will still keep getting on ryanair
6004164 its a brand that sort of winks at them so they may not consider it misleading

6004169 it is regrettable that events have caused us to review our shareholding and whether it is appropriate that the virgin brand should remain linked to virgin nigeria
6004170 the behaviour of the authorities was similar to the way the mafioso behaved in the us in the 1930s and not what i would have expected from the authorities in nigeria
6004171 if virgin nigeria can be treated in this way can any company in the world seriously consider investing in nigeria in the future

6004175 i expect barack obama to win washington state and i expect to be his partner as governor to bring the kind of results weve achieved in washington state all across america

6004177 were going to have tens of thousands of people who are voting for obama who will vote for us

6004186 i just want to play as much as i can and take my chances when i get them youll always be handed opportunities at united so its important you grasp them
6004187 we are all looking forward optimistically but we will have to work hard in order to achieve our targets
6004188 thats just a step on the way nothing more there are still a number of tasks i need to achieve
6004189 i look forward to all internationals i relaxed on holiday and am happy that we are back underway its up to each player now to perform i played five times at the european championships and now want to become a regular in the team

6004313 they wanted to see us stuck in jail so the olympics would look better
6004314 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6004315 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6004316 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6004317 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6004318 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6004319 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6004320 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6004321 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6004322 while we accept that constraints on runway capacity in the south east will limit the scope for the benefits of competition in the short term we believe that separate owners would be more active than baa in exploiting existing opportunities
6004323 in scotland where there are no similar capacity constraints we believe separate owners of edinburgh and glasgow would similarly improve their offerings
6004324 in scotland baa has until recently been noticeably slow to develop new routes at glasgow and edinburgh while at aberdeen its investment plans are regarded as unambitious despite relatively high levels of profitability
6004325 we remain of the view that glasgow and edinburgh airports serve separate markets and that competition between the two is highly unlikely regardless of ownership
6004326 if glasgow or edinburgh airport is to be sold by baa any potential buyer must show a strong commitment to continued investment
6004327 i think it is giving the suggestion to the competition commission that if the ownership of glasgow and edinburgh is split similar developments would take place there
6004328 for many years all the stores in our chain have stocked a wide variety of both domestic and imported cheeses last year however the five best selling cheeses at our newest store were all domestic cheddar cheeses from wisconsin furthermore a recent survey by cheeses of the world magazine indicates an increasing preference for domestic cheeses among its subscribers since our company can reduce expenses by limiting inventory the best way to improve profits in all of our stores is to discontinue stocking many of our varieties of imported cheese and concentrate primarily on domestic cheeses
6004329 governments should focus more on solving the immediate problems of today rather than trying to solve the anticipated problems of the future
6004330 how children are socialized today determines the destiny of society unfortunately we have not yet learned how to raise children who can help bring about a better society
6004331 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6004332 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6004333 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6004334 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6004335 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6004336 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6004337 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6004338 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6004339 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6004340 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6004341 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6004342 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6004343 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6004344 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6004345 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6004346 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6004347 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6004348 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6004349 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6004350 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6004351 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6004352 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6004353 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6004354 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6004355 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6004356 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6004357 gracias al creciemiento acelerado de nuestra empresa y a una buena ejecuci n de la cartera hp ha conseguido unos resultados fuertes en este tercer trimestre

6004373 there are no circumstances under which igor can become a safe member of our community
6004374 i dont remember lohrke ever coming to get his dog
6004375 i seriously thought that this dog was going to kill me
6004376 all mr lohrke is asking and all igor would be asking if he could talk is a fair chance to be heard
6004377 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6004378 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6004379 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6004380 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6004381 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6004382 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6004383 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6004384 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6004385 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6004386 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6004387 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6004388 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6004389 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6004390 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6004391 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6004392 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6004393 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6004394 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6004395 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6004396 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6004397 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6004398 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6004399 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6004400 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6004401 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6004402 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6004403 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6004404 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6004405 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6004406 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6004407 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6004408 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6004409 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6004410 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6004411 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6004412 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6004413 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6004414 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6004415 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6004416 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6004417 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6004418 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6004419 even though the toll is so high you should be proud of what you are doing the work that youre doing here is indispensable
6004420 were going to make sure that the means are put in place to ensure that this doesnt happen again
6004421 express the condolences and the pain of the afghan people to the french people for the loss that they have suffered
6004422 unless we do that pay more attention we will continue to suffer

6004434 i have two little dogs who are best friends with igor and hed never hurt them
6004435 even as i was screaming and being bitten he never came for the dog
6004436 i wouldnt want to be a city that under any circumstances or conditions let this animal back out again while we all held our breath for the next bite
6004437 i wish they didnt have to but it seems like its really necessary to protect people you cant just stop a dog like that

6004446 i kept saying what what i was hoping no one could read my lips
6004447 i couldnt believe i was holding the flag and getting a medal it was amazing
6004448 i felt i was always capable if i focused on myself but for others yes it was a surprise
6004449 in the beginning i did feel a little more jitters than i did in the first round
6004450 i had to kind of shake them off i knew i needed to react to the gun just focus on me and be quick and attack each hurdle
6004451 this is not limited to a zip code at all this is a celebration of americas best and the worlds best
6004452 its just wonderful youve got the greatest coach and the greatest inspiration on your team and come out with the greatest result
6004453 she wasnt able to come to the olympics this year but she sent me an e mail telling me that you can do it and stay focused
6004454 so now its dont put it on like its the finals i have to do something spectacular
6004455 its time we take back a little bit of track and field
6004456 i didnt get on with the manager at stockport so i had to get away
6004457 i lost confidence down there and he wasnt a nice man so i had to get away from the club
6004458 i wasnt enjoying my football to tell the truth i was coming home depressed and the manager didnt help me at all
6004459 dave penneys great for me when the gaffer signed me he said he wanted me to play out wide and that suits me because i like to run at players and get crosses in
6004460 i like to stay out wide get the ball and run at defenders
6004461 moving around is part and parcel of life as a footballer really you just accept it but all the lads have me feel really welcome
6004462 i think its helped us settle having some familiar faces around nobodys got me and adam confused yet i think thats because im better looking than him
6004463 i was amused to read davids comments that he would rather his side suffered relegation every other season than be like middlesbrough
6004464 david is a good friend but i can only assume relegation has affected his thinking a little i seriously doubt boro fans would swap our recent histories
6004465 since moving to the riverside in 1995 we have achieved five major cup finals are the only english side outside of the so called big four to have played in a european final have enjoyed successive seasons of uefa cup football won our first major trophy and enjoyed 11 consecutive years in the premier league
6004466 in the meantime birmingham have managed a couple of relegations and a lengthy spell in what is now the championship somehow i dont believe even their own supporters would agree their highs and lows have been preferable to ours
6004467 some people might not like relegation promotion relegation promotion but would you want to be a middlesbrough stuck in mid table every season
6004468 some people would settle for that because it is better for your heart but the highs and lows are what football is all about for me
6004469 but its kind of like riding a bike you get rusty if you dont do it for a while but when it comes back its just like an old friend
6004470 i like real life stuff where people are being inadvertently funny or doing funny things like when people dont get change back from a machine and how they react or people slipping but catching themselves before they really fall and they dont really get hurt
6004471 i saw john denver once when he was alive in hawaii and he was in the office to rent a car but they wouldnt rent him one because he had a traffic violation he was so ticked off and he came storming out and i was standing there and i said hey john he forced a smile and gave me the thumbs up it was the most funny thing ive seen in my life
6004472 i would get tired of it and id get bored im glad i get to do them both and i cant pick one over the other now that im a father i really hate leaving town id like to figure something out where i could stay at home more maybe write another book
6004473 get used to multitasking and get used to things being left undone and a bunch of things on the floor
6004474 when you first start you pick up all of the toys and pacifiers but im in a stage now where i just kick them out of the way
6004475 make sure that you are stretching so that your back doesnt go out because youre lifting a kid all the time its hard for me to sneak into the nursery while my son is sleeping because when i walk all of my joints and tendons are popping it sounds like im walking on bubble wrap
6004476 i found it easy to move to the north east
6004477 i was reluctant at one point and i didnt want to but you have to be a man and make hard decisions and its been the best decision i have made looking back i would not have changed it for the world
6004478 you have to decide to run away from the big lights if southern based players can get away from that and overcome the difficulties of leaving your family then they will find out that its a great place to live
6004479 anton is a good defender and he is his own man in his own right everyone knows what he is capable of and he was a regular for long enough at west ham
6004480 i think sunderland challenging for europe is a realistic goal
6004481 thats the main goal we have the earlier the better because once you are able to maintain that sort of status it helps to attract better players we are building and we are determined to finish in a higher spot than last seasons 15th
6004482 its disappointing but you have to be careful with hamstring injuries and we dont want a repeat of last season when sheki kuqi joined us and suffered a hamstring injury in his first game
6004483 it was so important to get a point at old trafford because it is such a difficult place to play
6004484 they won the last title so for us it is a very good point
6004485 it will give us confidence especially if we win the next match we have to back it up against bolton we need to play well at home next week but sundays point is a great start and hopefully we have shown people how we can play
6004486 the definitive resource list for designing developing marketing amp maintaining websites
6004487 i wont allow myself to be brought to camp crame i am innocent and im ready to defend myself
6004488 we are just relying on what the witnesses tell us im sure the mastermind and the motive will be known eventually
6004489 the positive identification of the witnesses is a very strong evidence in court it will be hard for the suspects to look for any alibi to contest that

6004494 die integration des atraveo online ferienhausmarktes bedeutet einen weiteren schritt um unser sortiment zur reiseplanung auf map24 zu erh hen
6004495 mit atraveo freuen wir uns einen starken partner gefunden zu haben der unseren usern eine qualitativ berzeugende auswahl an ferienwohnungen und h usern in ganz europa anbietet
6004496 nach deutlichen anstiegen bei mieten und eigentumsobjekten in der ersten jahresh lfte sind die preise leicht r ckl ufig die sommermonate sind traditionell eine gute zeit zur immobilienakquisition
6004497 die klassichen hochpreis bezirke wie d bling w hring oder hietzing erfahren weiterhin eine preisentwicklung nach oben einen boom konnten wir im letzten halben jahr auch in hernals und der josefstadt verzeichnen
6004498 schlechte lagen stagnieren im preis und entwickeln sich zum ladenh tter wo eine erfolgreiche vermittlung teilweise bis zu einem jahr beanspruchen kann
6004499 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
6004500 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought
6004501 coupling the two you have slow growth with higher inflation
6004502 this is beyond the wheels coming off of the meat supply system
6004503 and the people caught in the train wreck are you and me and all of our neighbors
6004504 when reports say that there is a one in 400 chance that the package of ground beef you pick up at the supermarket will be tainted with a lethal bacterium the food safety system is no longer functioning and immediate radical steps must be taken
6004505 there are many theories as to why there has been such an unprecedented jump in e coli
6004506 it could be regulatory complacency better reporting or immigration sweeps that have left slaughterhouses empty of skilled workers
6004507 high oil prices may have led to an e coli producing diet for cattle the microbe itself may even be evolving to elude capture
6004508 these ideas need investigation and research so that real change can begin
6004509 there are a lot of very smart very dedicated professionals in the food safety community
6004510 they have spent their careers working toward a better food supply and that collective knowledge is available to design and implement change
6004511 we need our leaders to get on board and get the food safety train back on track
6004512 this year we are exploring the needs of not only the defense establishment but of those facing civil aviation authorities and commercial service providers as well
6004513 when you talk about focusing on the big picture this is it
6004514 weve worked hard to create a forum that takes a more detailed look at the real issues facing those charged with trying to evolve defense and civil agencies into net centric frameworks
6004515 its exciting to be part of the electoral process in our country
6004516 we had the opportunity to meet some of the athletes and it was a pleasure to see them wearing products we had created
6004517 as the oldest player in this team i tried to contribute as much as i could
6004518 ronaldinho was a member of the brazilian squad that was eliminated by cameroon in the quarterfinals of the 2000 sydney games he was not eligible to play for the squad that failed to qualify for the 2004 athens games
6004519 the 28 year old ronaldinho had an average match against argentina losing the duel with former fc barcelona teammate lionel messi while messi set up two goals ronaldinhos best chance was a free kick that struck the post after brazil was trailing
6004520 its hard to say what happened its a difficult moment right now
6004521 it was a well played match in the first half but then we fell asleep for a couple of moments
6004522 sergio aguero scored for argentina in the 52nd and 58th minutes and juan roman riquelme sealed the victory argentinas first against brazil in three years in the 76th
6004523 we are not going to be playing for our top goal anymore
6004524 but thats what we have so we have to try to motivate each other
6004525 it was normal ronaldinho couldnt play in these olympics at the level everyone is used to seeing from him
6004526 without a doubt he was an example for the team on and off the field he will still contribute a lot for the national team
6004527 ronaldinho was satisfied with his performances so far but also said there is more coming
6004528 i have learned a lot with the losses and with the victories as well
6004529 gymnastics has meant so much to me im going to be busy but id love to keep going
6004530 i feel theres one more medal at worlds i can win to give me 10 i missed out an all around medal last year so i kind of feel like its meant to be
6004531 liukin is 18 and would be 22 for the 2012 olympics also in london that can be ancient in womens gymnastics
6004532 when she got an e mail from sharapova inviting her to do the shoot it was about as big as winning the gold medal
6004533 maybe in january if things calm down ill take a few classes
6004534 visa put the chinese characters on the atms that say destiny
6004535 we will have to do a lot more thinking on how to approach that
6004536 nastia liukin said the camaraderie on the u s team will be a big factor in her future decisions about competing she often has referred to her teammates as family and those frequent trips to the karolyi ranch outside houston that houses the national training center became a way to bond
6004537 even when i didnt know gymnastics would be my life i enjoyed it if you dont love your job its probably time to get a new one
6004538 we each wanted to be the one to walk away with the gold medal
6004539 the emotions and feelings you get from competing here are indescribable if i could get that feeling of accomplishment and honor again id give anything to be there
6004540 we need to attract hairdressers or lawyers who may have an old dream of becoming teachers
6004541 he says according to haarder there is no alternative to the new teacher types at a time when many teachers will soon retire unemployment is at record low and where too few will be teachers in they have offered the graduates a one year long education and promised a job as a teacher since 2000 with great success says head of an international education think tank lee sing kong many former bankers and engineers have taken up the offer and schools very much appreciate the practical knowledge that they can bring to education

6004551 elite bloggers often portray their analytical and news gathering skills as equal or more often superior to those of professional journalists but in the case of the ongoing conflict between russia and georgia the blogging world mostly failed to live up to its promises days after the fighting began even normally excellent sources of analysis and insight were still linking to the same narrow set of news sources sources that offered little more than thin quotes from government officials while this isnt necessarily a knock on say reuters or the new york times it takes a little time to get a correspondent on scene it is a tremendous failure on the part of the blogosphere noteworthy for precisely how it failed to deliver on its original promise breaking out of the mainstream medias tendency toward groupthink
6004552 these actions need to be taken in the context of a clear diagnosis of the events of the last two weeks for me the fog of war does not obscure the basic points
6004553 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

6004558 a lot of innocent people died i dont deserve to live
6004559 orange juice apple juice and frankly probably any juice should not be mixed with medication
6004560 plus we are not just talking about a short term prescription of antibiotics but pills you take every day for years
6004561 even worse we dont know which other juices or which medications may be a problem when combined
6004562 not just a sip several large swallows of cold water will help the medication get absorbed faster
6004563 we think in most cases you can just separate the juice and the pills by several hours to play it safe
6004564 what we have is a walk in freezer minus 18 degrees centigrade 0 degrees fahrenheit and in this room youve got about 700 000 different samples of plant material
6004565 theres a wheat rust that were greatly afraid will come into the united states and were screening our collection of wheat
6004566 were talking 20 000 or 30 000 different samples of wheat to find if any of it is resistant
6004567 smes are a vibrant and creative sector of the economy so theyre ideally placed to be climate change entrepreneurs
6004568 shells planning scenario planning suggests that in the future we will be reliant on a mix of a number of different energy sources and energy saving technologies grassroots innovation from small businesses could be a crucial factor in driving the development of this mix

6004606 if i go into a season and i say for fucks sake if we dont win anything they will all leave i have already lost the problem of the media is always to imagine the worst the problem of the manager is always to imagine the best
6004607 i didnt know the english were good at swimming i have been in this country for 12 years and i havent seen a swimming pool
6004608 i did not expect to lose a goal at a set piece to a header from a guy who is 58
6004609 if the england manager tells you to lose weight then thats what you do you do whatever it takes i feel good for it pizza will always be my favourite food but its a case of not eating it all the time
6004610 if i had been laughing when i was on the bench people would say i was an idiot eric cantona never smiled but i dont know if anyone ever asked him why he didnt look happier
6004611 we won the trophy for the most unlucky team last year is it a trophy to finish 12th and win the carling cup the real quality of a big club is to fight for the championship

6004624 one network took care of the conversion by retaining the existing interfaces training the users and requiring no development from our side
6004625 i am grateful for the efforts that g ran holgerson has made in the last year to ensure good integration with storebrand a good foundation has been created for the repositioning and growth we now face in the swedish market
6004626 im going to show you documents that were not shown you yesterday
6004627 this story that the bishop had never heard that thats not really accurate is it
6004628 orang orang rusia hidup dibawah kekuasaan orang mongol selama sekitar 200 tahun
6004629 dalam buku sekolah kami genghis khan digambarkan sebagai seorang monster buku buku tersebut adalah produk dari jaman itu dan penggambarannya sangat serampangan dan terkesan terlalu sederhana
6004630 saya selalu tertarik untuk mengambil tokoh terkenal dan menggalinya sedikit lebih dalam untuk mendapatkan klise dan mencari tahu apa yang terjadi di kehidupan nyata saya ingin tahu apakah dia seorang yang buruk yang dituduh membunuh jutaan orang bagaimana semua itu terjadi bagaimana dia menjadi seorang genghis khan
6004631 masa kecilnya benar benar tidak diketahui adanya dan kemudian anda akan mengetahui bahwasanya dia adalah anak yatim dia seorang budak semua orang mencoba untuk membunuhnya istrinya di culik dia mendapatkan kembali istrinya sudah dalam keadaan hamil bagi saya ini adalah awal dari sebuah cerita yang menarik tentang tokoh yang luar biasa
6004632 saya tidak mengatakan bahwa gumilev skeptis tetapi dia memiliki pemikirannya sendiri tentang the secret history of the mongols
6004633 ini jelas bahwa penulisnya sangat emosional beberapa teks sangat emosional tentu saja ketika anda menulis sebuah puisi syair terkadang lebih penting daripada fakta anda tidak bisa mempercayai 100 keakuratan historis dari sebuah puisi bagi gumilev the secret history of the mongols bukanlah sebuah buku yang sakral saya menggunakan banyak teorinya tentang kesenjangan zaman dalam secret history sebagai contoh adanya kesenjangan dalam kisah kisah genghis khan ketika berumur sepuluh tahun tiba tiba dia menghilang dan tidak seorangpun yang tahu apa yang terjadi dan dimana dia berada dan gumilev berteori bahwa kemungkinan dia ditangkap atau mungkin dipenjarakan saya pikir bagus untuk cerita ini jadi dalam cerita mongol temudgin menghabiskan bertahun tahun di penjara tangut
6004634 ini sangat menakjubkan dan sekali lagi ini merupakan sebuah cerita yang tidak familiar seorang bocah laki laki yang memilih istrinya pada usia sembilan tahun dan meskipun dia belum mengetahuinya hidupnya telah berubah untuk selamanya
6004635 tentu saja di akhir hayatnya genghis khan memiliki ratusan istri tapi sepanjang hidupnya borte adalah perempuan paling penting dia bukan hanya seorang istri tapi juga dia adalah seorang penasihat yang dekat dia mendiskusikan seluruh keputusan keputusan besarnya dengannya layaknya sebuah hubungan manusia modern partnership hubungan semacam ini bahkan tidak umum pada saat ini bahkan pada waktu itu tidak pernah terdengar sama sekali
6004636 dari awal dia mengatakan bahwa dia adalah anak saya dan dia memperlakukan dzuchi sebagai anaknya
6004637 saya selalu mencari yang terbaik dan saya sedang mencari siapa yang akan menangkap apa yang saya lihat dan akan membuat ini menjadi kuat
6004638 orang orang jepang memiliki pahlawan kuno yang terkenal dan hilang dan mereka mengira dia pergi ke mongol dan menjadi genghis khan dia adalah pahlawan nasional sebenarnya semua itu benar adanya di banyak tempat di kazakhstan mereka berfikir dia adalah seorang kazakh di korea mereka berfikir dia adalah orang korea
6004639 ini suasana klasik dan memaksa dimana teman menjadi musuh anda
6004640 saya sangat beruntung dengan pengkastingan karena honglei sun membawa kesempurnaan kombinasi antara ketegangan dan humor mereka benar benar orang yang berbeda satu sama lain tetapi mereka memiliki hubungan yang kuat perasaan yang kuat antar pribadi mereka
6004641 guka merupakan sutradara kasting yang hebat dan saya meminta bantuannya dalam pembuatan film mongol kami bepergian bersama ke mongolia dan menghabiskan beberapa minggu disana
6004642 dia menemukan odnyam odsuren seorang bocah yang luar biasa yang berperan sebagai temudgin muda
6004643 dia berkata sepertinya saya menemukannya tapi kamu harus datang dan melihatnya sendiri
6004644 dia menambahkan kami memiliki genghis khan versi jepang dan jamukha versi china sebagian kasting lainnya yang professional dan non professional adalah asli orang mongolia
6004645 dashi memiliki darah mongol dan tahu cara untuk mendekati materi ini baginya genghis khan adalah tipikal yang serius dan dia mengatakan pada saya sergei sebelum kita memulai film ini kita harus menemui kepala suku shaman mongol dan anda harus meminta izin untuk pembuatan film ini saya berpikir ini adalah ide yang cukup bagus karena suku shaman sangat penting di wilayah mongolia selama periode beberapa waktu orang orang mongolia berpikiran bahwa genghis khan adalah salah satu orang yang paling berpengaruh dalam suku shaman
6004646 dia memiliki tenda di alun alun utama dimana orang datang untuk menemuinya
6004647 mongol difilmkan di beberapa tempat yang paling terpencil di bumi sehingga wajar kalau kota terdekat hanya berjarak antara 12 bahkan 15 jam dengan menggunakan kendaraan diatas jalan yang kasar
6004648 kami akan membawa sesajen dan berkata kami datang kesini dengan niat yang baik tolong kami minta izin pada roh roh bisakah kami bekerja disini
6004649 saya percaya ini adalah salah satu cara untuk melakukannya karena ini adalah film yang sulit dibuat kadang kadang kami tidak tahu bagaimana kami bertahan saya kira karena kami mengikuti tradisi seperti kata pepatah dimana langit dijunjung disitu bumi dipijak kami benar benar berada di abad lain dan bekerja dengan orang orang yang berbeda dan ini adalah kepercayaan mereka saya kira mereka menghormati faktanya bahwa kami mengikuti tradisi mereka
6004650 kru saya jumlahnya berkisar 600 orang dan 1000 orang tambahan kuda kuda sama dengan tentara kamu bisa berperang dengan orang sebanyak ini dan menginvasi sebuah wilayah teritori
6004651 rogier adalah sineas yang luar biasa lightingnya sangat indah dan sense of framing nya tanpa cela
6004652 saya tahu saya dapat mempercayakan paruh kedua dalam film saya kepada sergey yang memiliki lokasi lokasi dan pengambilan gambar yang sulit dan dia berhasil dalam pengerjaan rangkaian action yang kompleks anda dapat merasakan energinya
6004653 saya merasa jatuh cinta pada mereka mereka memiliki energi yang luar biasa
6004654 what were concerned about is the chance that someone might half consciously check the independent box and then vote the straight democratic party ballot and then have their votes voided
6004655 in america most people believe they are independent with a small i
6004656 that is going to confuse some people and cause a lot of votes to be lost

6004662 the problem is that the priority of government officials is different their own pockets
6004663 while government and big business rake in gargantuan profits ofws are left with almost nothing the 200 monthly remittance their families receive have radically shrunk and continues to shrink with the spiraling prices of almost all basic needs and services
6004664 as per our report he was seriously wounded and his men carried him as they escaped
6004665 the reason they dont believe that government has a role in solving national problems is because they think government is the problem
6004666 everyone to go buy your own health care your own retirement and security your own child care your own schools your own private security forces your own roads your own levees
6004667 its called the ownership society in our past there has been another name for it its called social darwinism every man or woman for him or herself
6004668 alongside my own deep personal faith i am a follower as well of our civic religion
6004669 i am a big believer in the separation of church and state
6004670 in academia there is a vast difference between the two titles
6004671 i am a great admirer of our founding charter and its resolve to prevent theocracies from forming and its resolve to prevent disruptive strains of fundamentalism from taking root in this country
6004672 a lot of his policies have the government taking care of people instead of giving people a leg up he would rather give them a leg
6004673 one of those freaks you see on the streets around here
6004674 a ver a ver qui n dirige la batuta si callejeros o la yuta hija de puta
6004675 el uso de bengalas era una vieja costumbre entre el p blico del rock no censurar una costumbre no es incentivar

6004677 somos sobrevivientes familiares y amigos la responsabilidad no pasa por enjuiciar a callejeros la responsabilidad es nuestra que les dijimos para qu vas a estudiar no hay futuro lo que pasa es que a los sobrevivientes algunos familiares les dec an vos habl s porque est s vivo no como mi hijo y vivieron con culpa hasta ahora ahora se expresan y tienen derecho a hacerlo
6004678 high real estate prices make the south korean car maker look at chennai and hyderabad
6004679 theres a lot of pressure our owners theyre very successful people in other walks of life in the businesses that theyre involved in and believe you me they expect an awful lot of success in this one as well the first day that i signed i was told in no uncertain terms that promotion was expected and either youre with us or you wont be thats the day youre signing and its a lot of pressure to be throwing on a player they say all this to you with a straight face and youre thinking jesus but in a way its brilliant i enjoy being involved in the kind of club that expects success like that hopefully we can deliver
6004680 im very passionate want to do very well so hopefully ill get a chance
6004681 when i wasnt in the 40 i thought okay and went on my holidays
6004682 then while i was back in cork playing golf i got a phone call off fellow international martin rowlands at qpr saying youve got to be in dublin next week i was delighted
6004683 i remember euro 88 aged 7 remember watching it remember getting shoot magazine and stuff like that i massively remember italia 90 and usa 94 watching the matches on the big screen in douglas the whole country ground to a halt to think i could be part of something like that obviously if its a successful world cup campaign that people could be flocking to see the boys in green and i could be part of the squad well thats a huge motivation
6004684 im long enough in england to know that anything can happen and nothing should surprise me but obviously getting picked for this norway game shows that im in the managers thoughts and if i can impress then hopefully i might be part of that world cup qualifying squad
6004685 the managers been brilliant but marco tardellis been fabulous too
6004686 he came to our first game of the season against barnsley at loftus road i didnt even know he was there at the time and ive been talking to him about that so its great they make me feel welcome
6004687 ive watched both games on dvd since and there are a few things ive seen that i need to pick up on international footballs a little bit different to the football i play week in week out we played sheffield utd away last saturday theyre a big strong physical team and theres not many international teams that play like them but really i was just pleased to be involved in the internationals i just went out then and did the best i could if it worked out great if it didnt then at least id have failed giving it my best
6004688 theres denis irwin and roy keane and a few others too obviously im only starting out in my career with ireland but if i can keep involved and get a game from time to time then id love to be thought of in the same terms as those sorts of people it would be fabulous
6004689 its hard to see how they got themselves into that mess because theyre probably the best supported club in the country
6004690 back a couple of years ago they were getting massive gates so i dont know how this has all happened theyre obviously paying out too much money but i presume theyll get it sorted
6004691 our owners theyre very successful people in other walks of life in the businesses that theyre involved in and believe you me they expect an awful lot of success in this one as well the first day that i signed i was told in no uncertain terms that promotion was expected and either youre with us or you wont be thats the day youre signing and its a lot of pressure to be throwing on a player they say all this to you with a straight face and youre thinking jesus but in a way its brilliant i enjoy being involved in the kind of club that expects success like that hopefully we can deliver qpr official site balanta on standby rs teenager angelo balanta has been placed on standby for england under 19 duty the young striker who opened his goalscoring account for the season against swindon town in the carling cup last week could link up with the squad ahead of their friendly against holland at shrewsbury towns pro star stadium on tuesday 9th september 7 45pm kick off in the event of a drop out over the coming days balanta would link up with the squad on saturday 6th september
6004692 what is the most memorable moment of your career a signing for qpr as a kid i always supported liverpool but my best mates granddad used to be chief steward at qpr signing pro was what i always wanted to do
6004693 we are delighted to be able to tender our resignations from the board of queens park rangers football club in order to assist in the changes set to take place this week we believe the new investment coming into the club will be the most important for years will save qpr from the perilous financial position we have found ourselves in over the past years and should put the club in an excellent position to move forward we would like to thank gianni paladini in particular for attracting this important new investment and we are delighted he will stay on as chairman of the club gianni has had a difficult job keeping the club going but he has pulled off a master stroke in bringing in this new investment we are also deeply grateful to antonio caliendo and franco zanotti for both financing the club over the past years and for the terms upon which they have agreed to assist with the new investment we are certain the new investors and the new board will get behind john gregory and give him the support he needs we are also positive that the fans can get behind a new board and continue in their loyal and unrivalled support for the team it has been an honour for all of us to serve this great club and we are grateful to all the staff and supporters we have had the pleasure to work with

6004700 we call upon the un to take immediate steps to tackle the worsening problem
6004701 when big business comes out in support of what now looks like the imminent break up of baa there seems to be no mention of the very real possibility of job losses reduced terms and conditions of employment and the stress that major announcements like this can bring to ordinary workers and their families
6004702 unite along with other trade unions represented at baa have only just resolved the dispute surrounding the baa pension scheme
6004703 last year industrial action at baa over pensions was only averted by a commitment to embark on a full and thorough period of consultation with the trade unions this being concluded unite was of the opinion that a period of stability for our members employed by baa would prevail this no longer seems to be the case
6004704 airports are an essential part of the uks transport infrastructure they are the gateway to our nation and further development and expansion is central to plans for economic growth and success
6004705 if what is being said is that the privatisation of the uks airport infrastructure has failed as it has following the sell off many other areas of privatised infrastructure and utilities perhaps now it is the time to bring this essential infrastructure back under public control
6004706 the future of current finance commitments to planned capital expenditure by baas spanish owner ferrovial who raised gbp10 billion of debt to purchase baa is also a real concern for unite if the commissions view is upheld and key areas of the companys operations are put under enforced sale it may well lead to the airports being sold off under market value we are seeking urgent discussions with the company in the wake of the commissions thinking

6004710 we have chosen this theme to stress the fact that people with down syndrome and their families develop right throughout their lives we are constantly encountering new experiences and personal demands in circumstances that can be both challenging and fulfilling for each individual family and community
6004711 we are seen as leaders not followers when it comes to issues such as mainstream education for children with down syndrome and independent living so this event will give us a chance to share our experiences while learning about the latest research and international best practice in health education and social research
6004712 this congress will give us the opportunity to listen and learn from best practice across the globe helping us deliver sustainable change in the lives of young adults with down syndrome on issues that really matter from living in the community to fair employment opportunities
6004713 every parent thinks their son or daughter is special and we are no different
6004714 leading up to that kick i knew i had to take a lot of responsibility
6004715 my teammates played their hearts out all game and it came down to me to give it up like that would be heart breaking
6004716 youve just got to be able to shake the pressure off and go back to whatever you practice and know you can do it and know you can do well
6004717 its the same mentality in all sports you have to calm your nerves and get your mind in gear
6004718 one thing my coaches told me is to think about something i like to do other than kicking or maybe think about my favorite food a nice big steak to get your mind off the kick and get your mind at ease
6004719 you have to keep your eyes behind the ball so you see the whole ball and not just have your head down
6004720 you have to swing the leg up because you want to get the ball up and high and youve got to swing straight
6004721 your teammates have been busting their butts all day and you can give relief for them not having to do any more running
6004722 i think its exciting to be the one guy out there and have your teammates trust you and the coaches behind you
6004723 i probably feel more relaxed now than i have at any time
6004724 whether the writings on the wall i dont know but i know what my job is
6004725 the major key is to get your team to focus because usually those who are older have the ability to focus on the task at hand
6004726 theyre not easily distracted certain things dont enter into their thought process they can eliminate those things and stay on task can you stay on track can you stay focused can you eliminate all the things that take you away from allowing yourself to be your best thats what well start at try to get them to be older

6004740 david liddy over the past seven years has pioneered the owner managed branch model and revolutionised the way we deliver customer service
6004741 he has enabled the bank to expand its network from 93 branches within queensland in 2001 to 283 branches in every australian state and territory
6004742 while the financial landscape has changed forever i believe our concentration of business in queensland and west australia has helped us to weather changes better than some other institutions

6004745 north pole may be ice free for first time this summer
6004746 what government should be focused on is raising the incomes and the aspirations and the opportunities for the millions of people who are stuck on low incomes and that is where this government has failed not because they are bad people not because they dont have noble ambitions but because their measure which is entirely reliant on the state which is about redistribution has failed failed on their own terms
6004747 labour has failed it has created a more unfair society and i think there is a real opportunity for the
6004748 we will keep tax credits but we will add to the battle on poverty other things like welfare reform like extending educational opportunity like supporting families and these conservative methods of achieving progressive goals are likely to be far more successful and create a fairer society
6004749 at the moment borrowing is rising and thats a real issue
6004750 the truth is gordon browns old fashioned leftist idea that only the state can guarantee fairness has led to a decade of top down state control policies that have made our country less fair
6004751 first it was change then it was aspiration and earlier this year it was all about government being on your side
6004752 now were told before its even started that the next gordon brown relaunch will be about fairness
6004753 m s de 80 millones de personas en el mundo padecen epoc y lamentablemente m s la sufrir n en las pr ximas d cadas especialmente en los pa ses en desarrollo como la argentina hoy es la cuarta causa de muerte y subir a ser la tercera causa en el a o 2020
6004754 mucha gente se sorprende al escuchar que esta enfermedad respiratoria pase a ser una epidemia pero ser la consecuencia del fuerte consumo de tabaco que hubo y hay a n en los pa ses en desarrollo
6004755 en las pr ximas d cadas ya se estim al menos para canad que habr m s mujeres con epoc que hombres el da o del tabaco a los pulmones femeninos ocurre m s temprano
6004756 pero no todos saben que la padecen ni reciben tratamientos que les permitir an mantener una buena calidad de vida
6004757 muchos m dicos fuman y entonces ni ellos ni sus pacientes tienen la percepci n del riesgo que supone la enfermedad
6004758 hoy sabemos que no s lo afecta a los pulmones sino que se trata de una inflamaci n sist mica del organismo por la cual los huesos y los m sculos se debilitan hay una mayor tendencia a sufrir infecciones y sube el riesgo cardiovascular
6004759 lo interesante puntualiz giugno es que esas exacerbaciones se pueden prevenir si los pacientes reciben la vacuna antigripal y la antineumococo y la combinaci n de salmeterol y fluticasona y si realizan rehabilitaci n f sica para que las piernas recuperen masa muscular

6004763 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6004764 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6004765 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

6004768 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
6004769 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
6004770 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
6004771 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
6004772 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them you can send them home and ill paddle them or you can have me come out to the school and we can both paddle them
6004773 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
6004774 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time
6004775 we teach our children that violence is wrong yet corporal punishment teaches children that violence is a way to solve problems
6004776 it perpetuates a cycle of child abuse it teaches children to hit someone smaller and weaker when angry
6004777 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6004778 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6004779 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6004780 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6004781 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6004782 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6004783 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6004784 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6004785 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6004786 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6004787 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6004788 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6004789 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6004790 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6004791 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6004792 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6004793 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6004794 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6004795 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6004796 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6004797 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6004798 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6004799 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6004800 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6004801 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6004802 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6004803 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6004804 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6004805 this is a planning took where all things are going
6004806 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6004807 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6004808 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6004809 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6004810 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6004811 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6004812 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6004813 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6004814 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best

6004856 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6004857 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6004858 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6004859 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6004860 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6004861 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6004862 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6004863 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6004864 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6004865 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6004866 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6004867 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6004868 when he sticks his tongue into your mouth grab onto it with your lips gently sucking it and flicking the tip of his tongue with your own at this point you will certainly be feeling the result in his pants
6004869 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
6004870 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
6004871 i definitely think we have the potential to win this year
6004872 im not surprised she was elected to be a captain at a college level as well shes a good leader both on the field and off the field shes a good communicator very into her team and making sure everyone gets along
6004873 we have to work on transitioning the ball a little bit on defense and getting in the circle and scoring
6004874 siempre que los tr mites se cumplan y est todo dentro de la legalidad
6004875 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia
6004876 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
6004877 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
6004878 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno
6004879 detritus de la sociedad seres sin escr pulos y sin entra as que en pos del dinero y de la fortuna ca an en punta arenas atra dos por la f cil impunidad
6004880 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
6004881 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
6004882 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6004883 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6004884 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6004885 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6004886 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6004887 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6004888 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6004889 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6004890 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
6004891 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
6004892 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
6004893 moskwa na razie nie og asza listy mo liwych kontrposuni

6004897 she wants to know shes going to work with someone with vision
6004898 but it did turn into a bit of a bad news story because people couldnt get in
6004899 i will always work with ewan for example hes a phenomenal stage actor he delivers
6004900 and what i love about ewan is he says to his agents i want to do theatre he carves out the time
6004901 hes a man who has spent many years exploring every medium including opera and film as a director producer and writer
6004902 he had heard we were doing a season with seats for 3 50
6004903 hes on record as being behind the idea of accessibility hes the great inspiration behind me doing this wyndhams season
6004904 he was so prolific so young we all decided we knew what he could do but look at the places ken branagh is going now he probably always could but he was doing it as a young man and now hes doing it as a middle aged man
6004905 hes a phenomenal collaborator a real company leader he doesnt work in isolation
6004906 they have been working on it for quite a few months we get the theatre for them and they come and do a day on the stage
6004907 the idea that ken knows hamlet so well from being in it on stage on radio on film then turns director and offers something of that experience to a younger actor is very exciting
6004908 as you build a track record inevitably you get people who hear about it being a good experience and want to sign up
6004909 but dusty phrases meaning something juicy ensuring the lifeblood of theatre for the future
6004910 this is a landmark moment for us going into the west end doing this access for all season it is a great statement of the second half of my tenure at the donmar
6004911 what were hoping is that the whole wyndhams season will get audiences back in to see straight plays
6004912 its a play that speaks to me in some way a few years ago i did as you like it and it was a life changing experience it was a play that tackled the great themes of love and twelfth night is the even more perfect play about people coming together through the power of love
6004913 but i think its a good thing occasionally to get up in the morning and be open to romance i dont like it when i get cynical we live in a world where we look for an ulterior motive in everything but sometimes people do things for the good of them
6004914 every time i open a show i get some shitty review
6004915 i have people in my life whether christopher or my mother or the critics who keep me on my toes and ensure i dont get too golden boy ish
6004916 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
6004917 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
6004918 we raise our heads high with full knowledge that he did not die in vain we pray for the quick recovery and the inner healing of his loved ones
6004919 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6004920 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6004921 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6004922 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6004923 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6004924 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6004925 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6004926 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6004927 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6004928 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6004929 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales

6004935 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6004936 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6004937 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6004938 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6004939 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6004940 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6004941 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6004942 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6004943 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6004944 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6004945 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6004946 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6004947 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6004948 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6004949 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6004950 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
6004951 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
6004952 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
6004953 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
6004954 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
6004955 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
6004956 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
6004957 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
6004958 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
6004959 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
6004960 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
6004961 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
6004962 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
6004963 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6004964 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6004965 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6004966 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6004967 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
6004968 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
6004969 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
6004970 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
6004971 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
6004972 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
6004973 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
6004974 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
6004975 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
6004976 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
6004977 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
6004978 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6004979 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6004980 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6004981 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6004982 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes

6004987 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
6004988 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
6004989 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
6004990 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
6004991 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
6004992 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
6004993 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
6004994 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
6004995 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
6004996 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
6004997 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
6004998 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
6004999 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
6005000 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
6005001 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
6005002 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
6005003 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
6005004 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
6005005 these clarifications have become necessary following allegations by a member of the house of representative representing southern ijaws federal constituency hon
6005006 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6005007 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
6005008 he just got out of surgery had his triple bypass and is resting comfortably
6005009 we are most grateful for all of the prayers and support we have received
6005010 he came over for a couple of weeks a couple of years ago
6005011 i was glad he did it it was kind of an honor for us
6005012 he could run the bases he could hit for average he could hit for power he could hit your best pitch and he could hit your worst pitch i just tried to keep the ball in the ballpark against him sometimes it worked sometimes it didnt
6005013 die beiden rankings best tigen die f hrende rolle wiens als internationale kongressmetropole
6005014 denn trotz der verschiedenen z hlkriterien der zwei organisationen liegt wien darin seit jahrzehnten immer im spitzenfeld das wirkt sich auch auf die position von sterreich in den l ndervergleichen aus in der uia liste 2007 wurde so rang 9 erreicht wobei von den insgesamt 366 in sterreich gewerteten internationalen kongressen 81 5 in wien stattfanden
6005015 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6005016 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6005017 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6005018 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6005019 with romantic relationships just like friendships its all about confidence connection and again and most important communication
6005020 but what do i know im just a man and everyone knows we have a learning disability where women are concerned
6005021 we selected motorola for this wimax project after a thorough evaluation and several field trials motorola has extensive wimax experience its system is easy to set up and requires minimum installation footprint which in the process helps reduce deployment time and lowers overall operational cost
6005022 we are also impressed by motorolas ability to provide advanced features like mimo b in a live system these features will ensure a smooth network upgrade when we need to increase system capacity in the future
6005023 i think i could do that that would be great for me to do maybe i could do that this year
6005024 this is for charity your kids are going to know about this dont embarrass the family get it done lopez
6005025 you should do this because ive done it and i know it makes you a better person and it makes you feel great and sleep better and be happier
6005026 i prefer the man made objects because they beg the question why would someone make this but its the mix that makes us unique we believe we display things you cant see anywhere else

6005039 you go out there and you want to prove people wrong and get better
6005040 hes a smart quarterback and we believe if hes out there that he can make the right reads and do what tom does out there
6005041 it wasnt really going to work out here the way that we had hoped and he had hoped
6005042 at the same time there are still a couple preseason games left and time before the season opener and i think there are some other teams that are looking for tight ends and maybe there is a better opportunity for him somewhere else
6005043 i obviously know that at the end of the day that the owner has the final say so on whether or not he wants to give a guy an opportunity or not
6005044 mike has wanted to give chris this opportunity and asks that we do the best job that we can to try to prepare him and get him ready to play football
6005045 the mri news actually was good the doctor told me that the mri side by side looked identical to the one they took in spring training
6005046 there is a little inflammation which they injected and prescribed rest so we dont have any long term concerns at the present time it just looks like something thats going to be facilitated by rest
6005047 i think doing so well in the regional is the bigger accomplishment because the competition there is so much better than at the state level
6005048 i think good competition brings out the best in some kids and the competition there was awesome the kids really stepped it up when they had to i never thought wed get that far
6005049 that was a tough call because then the bases would have been loaded with one out
6005050 then the noose gets a little tighter on the pitcher

6005055 it was a fantastic result for alan but hes always been a great student hes very bright and self motivated he works hard and hes been generous to the school alan was a prefect in leaving cert as well as being chairman of the student council he was also on the maths team that came fifth in the all ireland
6005056 they were the ones i was banking on all summer i was a bit apprehensive about german and accountancy but thankfully i had nothing to worry about
6005057 its a four year degree and then theres three years of training and exams in the uk actuary is all about risk analysis whether it be in insurance pensions helping brian cowen with the budget or working on the stock market
6005058 when i walked in they were all smiles i couldnt believe it i though id been given the wrong results or that it was a misprint im still shocked it hasnt sunk in yet
6005059 ive always wanted to do something in science i thought about going into pharmacy but i wasnt interested enough in pharmacy as a profession to go down that avenue i thought the best thing to do would be get a good base in science and then branch out after that the entry is normally around 300 points to science in ucd but im not sorry i put it down i wouldnt do a different course just to use up my points
6005060 myself and a gang of my friends had plans made so i came home after getting my results packed my bag and headed for the train we went to the muse concert in marley park that night so it was a great day all round
6005061 i was really nervous and left it a few minutes to go in to get my results because i didnt want to get stuck queuing im absolutely delighted with what i got and planning to do primary teaching with psychology in mary immaculate in limerick
6005062 i found the paper ok but i was worried i had made a mess of it because it was a nice paper i was afraid i was being lured into a false sense of security
6005063 i thought i had done fairly well but didnt think i was anywhere near 600 points
6005064 trotzdem k nnen die besten systeme den autofahrer nicht vor sich selbst sch tzen mit jedem kilometer pro stunde mehr wird die knautschzone bei einem aufprall kleiner damit steigt auch das ausma der verletzungen bei einem crash und nat rlich auch die todesgefahr
6005065 dramatisch wird es f r kleine mitfahrer beispielsweise in einer babyschale auf der r ckbank auch die optimale befestigung der babyschale kann nicht verhindern dass es bei 80 km h zu einer massiv erh hten belastung kommt und das kind schwerste verletzungen in der brust davontragen kann
6005066 deshalb sind die fahrer umso mehr aufgefordert das eigene risiko durch eine umsichtige fahrweise und eine den verh ltnissen angepasste geschwindigkeit zu verringern fahrerassistenzsysteme wie zum beispiel bremsassistenten k nnen dabei zus tzlich unterst tzen
6005067 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6005068 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6005069 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6005070 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6005071 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6005072 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6005073 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6005074 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

6005078 i finished off the olympic games with to me the most perfect ending ever
6005079 to finally get the gold medal on my very last routine meant the world to me
6005080 we went out there and showed we are the best going 1 2 in the all around thats never been done by the united states the americans have never had 1 2 on beam before either and 2 3 on floor isnt too bad
6005081 four years ago we had a large failure and we blamed ourselves
6005082 i would never trade one of my silvers for gold
6005083 what i went through to get them is very special to me and really touched my heart
6005084 she came in with the possibility of winning a few gold medals and that hasnt happened we were running out of chances
6005085 i knew it wasnt quite my best routine but i knew it was enough for a medal but im really happy for shawn three silvers is kind of hard to take i couldnt be more proud of her
6005086 thats the great ending she was a little bit disappointed after the all around but she went all the way to the end i can appreciate that
6005087 to finally have a gold and be an olympic gold medalist its what everyone dreams of
6005088 i hit the floor and i looked at mark and said can you believe that just happened

6005100 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6005101 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
6005102 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados

6005110 they saw people stickering our a b products in a nonuniform way all over the boxes and bar codes
6005111 their point nhdi is this is my property and youre defacing it
6005112 there were a lot of very high results and a substantial number of students who scored over 500
6005113 whats noticeable is that the vast majority of the students are very intent on going on to third level theres a lot of happiness here and most students will easily get the courses theyre looking for
6005114 this is my first year in the school and im absolutely delighted with the results they were excellent
6005115 the majority of students were really pleased with their results when they came in to collect them and a very high percentage of our leaving cert class will be going on to third level with galway followed by dublin being the most popular destinations
6005116 it was an excellent year the group worked very hard and that always shows up
6005117 the polish student achieved an a1 on his polish paper and got almost 500 points overall the results were solid all over
6005118 often the teachers and parents are forgotten about but all three groups deserve to be congratulated there were a lot of nervous and excited students pouring into the school to collect their results and there was great emotion and tears of joy
6005119 this years group were a hard working bunch and they set the standards high its important to remember that the leaving cert is a two year course and these students worked hard for the two years im delighted to see them getting the results they deserve
6005120 students need to do a reasonable amount of work regularly and remain focused but equally they need to enjoy life and socialise
6005121 balance is so important for the students as they go on to third level or into the workforce
6005122 one of my other neighbours knocked on my door and said there was smoke coming out of the house next door
6005123 i ran and out and stacie came out behind me i went into the house first and saw jackie on the floor i went upstairs to see if i could see where the smoke was coming from
6005124 we thought it was the attic to start with as thats where it felt like the heat was
6005125 there was thick black smoke everywhere and you couldnt see a thing
6005126 it didnt bother me i just grabbed a towel and put it over my mouth and ran upstairs
6005127 i quickly felt the effects of the smoke though it went right onto my chest
6005128 you only think about how dangerous it is after its happened but at the time i didnt think twice about it i just wanted to make sure there was no one else in there
6005129 seems that there are more than a couple of folks taking notice of your postings tom excellent job i believe cleveland is better off because of the job you did

6005137 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6005138 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6005139 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6005140 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6005141 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6005142 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6005143 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6005144 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6005145 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6005146 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6005147 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6005148 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6005149 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos

6005239 a college or university only insures the building not a students personal belongings such as clothes books and electronics so they should be sure they have insurance to cover such things
6005240 students usually bring everything they own and find that once they get here that they do not have enough space for it all
6005241 a student may know more than the average incoming student about the campus but they still wont know it all as policies activities and living arrangements change yearly so be patient ask questions and listen
6005242 freshmen need to understand that the collegiate experience is a wonderful time to meet and interact with people who are different than they are it may be the first time they are asked to communicate their opinion wants and needs to someone else in a constructive way
6005243 being open to new and different ideas can be a little scary at first but the benefit of listening to another perspective will be invaluable in a students development

6005246 these instructions are the final step in a tremendous effort to bring the form 990 up to date and to reflect the diversity and complexity of the tax exempt community
6005247 the revised form will give the irs and the public a much better view of how exempt organizations operate the improved transparency provided by these changes will also benefit the tax exempt community
6005248 we were gratified by the amount of help the irs received from the tax exempt community through public comments to redesign the form 990 and revise its instructions
6005249 this input helped us achieve our goal of improving compliance while minimizing burden we will now begin working with the tax exempt sector to help organizations complete the form and prepare for the 2009 filing season
6005250 this pathogen has spread to all the oceans of the world and is resistant to many antibiotics
6005251 no one has seen such a rapid triggering of autophagy before
6005252 treating the human cells with an autophagy inhibitor halted the protein breakdown process but did not save the cells because v para uses other pathways by which to kill cells
6005253 however because it can kill by several routes its important to understand all of them
6005254 weve received a wake up call that this is important environmentally and we want to understand at the molecular level how this pathogen infects kills and persists
6005255 there are people getting sick from this emerging pathogen in the united states yet there is no major effort to understand its pathology
6005256 there are many ways to kill a cell and weve discovered yet another one the bacterium hijacks activities from us and deregulates them its like a bulldozer
6005257 egs could be the killer app of the energy world it has the potential to deliver vast quantities of power 24 7 and be captured nearly anywhere on the planet and it would be a perfect complement to intermittent sources like solar and wind
6005258 innovation is the path to massive quantities of cleaner cheaper energy the people were funding today have a real shot at lowering the cost of egs and bringing us closer to our goal of renewable energy cheaper than coal

6005262 the recent allegations made by greenpeace are totally without foundation they are an absurd populist gimmick
6005263 internal danzer group documents show in great detail the price fixing arrangements between the groups swiss based trading arm interholco ag and the parent firms logging subsidiaries in the drc and the republic of the congo
6005264 evade the payment of a variety of taxes to which it is liable to the drc
6005265 it is unfortunate that greenpeace despite the fact that it is in possession of many items of stolen data fails to mention that danzer operations suffered a loss of 11 million euros 17 million in 2003 alone
6005266 one cannot evade paying taxes when there were no profits to tax in the first place
6005267 export figures for the whole of the drc 2002 05 and the republic of the congo 2004 06 indicate that the phenomenon of tax evasion through under invoicing of the sales value of exported timber from both countries is by no means restricted to the danzer group

6005272 these transactions might not fully comply with local drc law
6005273 when only one nuclear bomb could destroy a city like minneapolis
6005274 senator mccain its time to get serious about reducing the nuclear threat
6005275 out of an abundance of respect for both parties we will not allow attack ads of either persuasion to be prominently displayed in our concourses our customers and employees complained and we responded we will not be a party to petty political attacks on either side
6005276 nuclear weapons are scary and thats why we need to pay attention to them
6005277 but to say that the billboard is anti mccain is ludicrous in fact both mccain and obama largely agree with us that we need to rid the world of nuclear weapons these are not attack ads they are a strong reminder to both candidates that this is a very serious issue they need to address northwest airlines is trying to censor free speech and i dont think thats their role
6005278 the cold war ended nearly 20 years ago but the united states and russia still have many thousands of nuclear weapons and each keeps more than a thousand on hair trigger alert ready to be launched within a matter of minutes
6005279 this creates a real risk of an accidental or unauthorized russian launch against one or more american cities we need a public debate about u s nuclear weapons policy and thats why we launched our media campaign
6005280 toward true security ten steps the next president should take to transform u s nuclear weapons policy
6005281 this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone
6005282 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defense site that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of a long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6005283 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 per cent
6005284 both sides have achieved their goals this is a great success for poland
6005285 for that reason no one who has good intentions toward us and toward the western world should be afraid of it

6005293 its been explosive its light years from 2004 youtube didnt exist four years ago and now it is being heavily used for politics
6005294 google is attempting to expand its influence over the political process to help it achieve its commercial goals
6005295 google likes to bask in self congratulatory rhetoric claiming it has the publics interests at heart its all about accessing peoples data for targeted marketing
6005296 in this us election year what information could be more important than the candidates own words to describe their views actions and platforms
6005297 as idealistic as that sounds is as idealistic as we are it is exciting all around not just for google
6005298 this new politics is disruptive upsetting old arrangements and displacing people invested in the old ways

6005300 so that in two years or so there will be a small ice age that lasts from 60 to 80 years
6005301 summer heat continues in short supply continuing a trend that has dominated much of the 21st centurys opening decade
6005302 there have been only 162 days 90 degrees or warmer at midway airport over the period from 2000 to 2008 thats by far the fewest 90 degree temperatures in the opening nine years of any decade on record here since 1930
6005303 the suns surface has been fairly blank for the last couple of years and that has some worried that it may be entering another maunder minimum the suns 50 year abstinence from sunspots which some scientists have linked to the little ice age of the 17th century
6005304 based on the past armagh measurements this suggests that over the next two decades global temperatures may fall by about 2 degrees c that is to a level lower than any we have seen in the last 100 years
6005305 the essays collected in this book bear testimony to the extraordinary interest of the rwenzori massif

6005307 consider these mountains consider the phenomenon of creation this massif on the equatorial girdle of the world some 45km in length overall and 23km wide with its clusters of might peaks of which until recently five were glaciered and the entire upper canopy under permanent snow
6005308 do you know there is no such place in the world that compares with rwenzori its glaciered plateaux lie at 16 000 feet its peaks rise to nearly 17 000 feet over 5 000 feet higher than the greatest mountains of europe the vegetation and wildlife of rwenzori reach almost to the snouts of its glaciers and of course overlap the outer fall of its snows it is a world of its own
6005309 the territory above say 11 000 feet induces the famous surreality of gigantic species among its prevailing vegetation of senecios lobelias heathers and helichrysums which occur nowhere else on the globe except on a far lesser scale on other east african heights kilimanjaro kenya and elgon
6005310 to our rwenzori we ascribe an unprecedented array of unique species for so compact a piece of territory a mountain island as it were all the species derived from its combination of attitude and climate its 15 species of mammals some of them formidable and famous like the rwenzori black leopard the rwenzori colobus and the hyrax its 25 species of reptiles its 18 unique birds including the brilliant turaco and its daringly designed sunbirds its score upon score of strictly rwenzori insects mosses and fungi
6005311 the semliki valley was the melting pot in which many different groups of immigrants to the region coalesced into clans before moving east into the heartland of bunyoro kitara where they mingled with immigrants from the north northeast and south to form the bakitara people
6005312 the semliki valley also experienced reverse emigration of groups such as the bakitara or bachwezi from the heartland bunyoro kitara who were fleeing the violence associated with state formation
6005313 all in all the future of language use in the region looks bright except in cases where some languages and dialects could become extinct and should this happen it would be a great loss of human heritage
6005314 in spite of the pressure on the resources and occasional outbreaks of ethnic conflict mount rwenzori and the adjacent rwenzori region serve as a symbol to which all these outline cultural groups look for posterity the pastoralists will need the rivers water and pasture while the cultivator needs the soil and the hunter needs the forest and the wilderness in this way all rwenzoris cultures use the environment for cultural enrichment
6005315 the future of the rwenzori mountains and the communities that lie around them is today closely bound up with the geo political machinations and wars that have engulfed the great lakes region
6005316 the hopes of local rwenzori communities are not only linked to the return of peace but also a continuation of colonial myths about the mountains of the moon in order to draw tourists and attract development the rwenzori will in all likelihood continue to be inscribed with a western history that obscures local cultural knowledge traditions and histories the mountains have thus retained to this day the names conferred on them by abruzzi with only a small change from ruwenzori to rwenzori but otherwise the imperial names remain in what is now a national park only one lowly feature is named after a ugandan the john matte hut on the trekking circuit
6005317 the essays collected in this book bear testimony to the extraordinary interest of the rwenzori massif

6005319 consider these mountains consider the phenomenon of creation this massif on the equatorial girdle of the world some 70 miles km in length overall and 40 km wide with its clusters of might peaks of which until recently five were glaciered and the entire upper canopy under permanent snow
6005320 do you know there is no such place in the world that compares with rwenzori its glaciered plateaux lie at 16 000 feet its peaks rise to nearly 17 000 feet over 5 000 metres higher than the greatest mountains of europe the vegetation and wildlife of rwenzori reach almost to the snouts of its glaciers and of course overlap the outer fall of its snows it is a world of its own

6005323 do you know this place its hidden gulches its high steep sided silent lakes its literally impenetrable forest swathes of helichrysums impenetrable to man the ferocious descent of its temperatures nightly within the space of a single hour from the heat of a european summers afternoon to below zero its comparable caprice of meteorological changeability in a matter of minutes from clear heaven ward infinity to an assault of hail snow and fog
6005324 these works give a few lines to the bakonzo he recruited without whom 1 venture he could not possibly have achieved what he did the prince and his ghost writer speak of 80 bakonzo all presumably hunters from the mubuku valley whom he recruited for the first three legs of the ascent to the rock shelter of bujongolo above the bamboos the expeditions base camp of these fifteen were selected for higher port and there is not a moments speculation as to why a mukonzo might be unwilling to breach the snows of their olympus they were commended for cleverness with their sticks on the climb but remain uncredited for knowing all the tracks and intricacies of covert routes and tunnels which and ascent entails
6005325 independent i would say that august of 1962 of the kingdom of toro and thus of uganda and indeed of britain itself whose writ as the colonial power still had a couple of months to run isaya made his declaration from his new kahindangamo his drum headquarters in that self same buswagha territory of highland southern busongora where he had first mooted the bakonzo life history research society blhrs
6005326 fearful preventions and assaults were visited in those early years of the kingdom of rwenzururu yet miraculously it survived there are those among us here who grew up in the midst of it those of that self same kingly family it survived a ruthless assault in late 1964 by ugandas military recently shed of its british officers sweeping the highland ridges burning looting and shooting anyone in flight it survived the death of rwenzururus first king isaya mukirane on 28 august 1966 it survived a devastating assault in september 1967 by ugandan troops which ravaged the seat of government its palace and parliament building and put the community to flight
6005327 yet first under the regency and an effective premiership and at the end of the decade after the formal installation of isaya kibanzangas 18 year old eldest son charles wesley as omusinga king of rwenzururu the highland state had reasserted its presence and taken shape
6005328 the ending of the kingdoms administrative and political separation from uganda and likewise from congo in that there was anything coherent from which to have seceded from was a planned rational and orderly affair carefully negotiated with government in kampala it took place on 15 august 1972 precisely 20 years to the day after rwenzururus declaration of its independence at a massed rally and formal ceremony at kasese
6005329 the semliki valley was the melting pot in which many different groups of immigrants to the region coalesced into clans before moving east into the heartland of bunyoro kitara where they mingled with immigrants from the north north east and south to form the bakitara people
6005330 the semliki valley received in reverse emigration groups of bakitara or bachwezi from the heart land bunyoro kitara fleeing the violence associated with state formation
6005331 warfare and political centralisation in the bunyoro nkore mpororo and toro kingdoms tended to push groups of people to the peripheral areas of these emerging polities from the bunyoro kitara heartland populations moved westward and southward where the toro kingdom formed population moved further west into busongoro the semliki valley and subsequently into the rwenzori mountains
6005332 in busongora the semliki valley and the rwenzori mountains the different groups of immigrants coalesced into the bakonzo and bamba who in the 1960s violently challenged the authority of the rulers of the toro kingdom in the form of the rwenzururu movement
6005333 the bamba and bakonzo tribes were formed on the periphery of the kitara empire they thus included remnants of the earliest immigrants as well as a variety of different groups of people agriculturalists and pastoralists alike who came to busongora and the semliki valley fleeing political and military pressures or the warfare violence associated with state formation in the kingdom areas to the east of the rwenzori mountains along with those later fleeing the turmoil caused in the 19th century by the kilongalonga slave raiders and traders
6005334 the turmoil of the 19th century pushed these groups into physical and cultural isolation the bakonzo in the rwenzori mountains and the bamba in the inaccessible bwamba plains thus sealing their fate as marginal tribes in toro kingdom these people not only preserved historical traditions elsewhere obscured by the creation of the colonial toro kingdom and the british colonial state but retained linguistic forms lukonzo and kwamba that sharply distinguished them
6005335 thus although originally part of the kitara people the bamba and bakonzo became different in relation to other people in the region and so became discriminated against on the basis of tribe of culture in reaction they aspired to be recognised as nationalities leading to their violent struggle to establish the rwenzururu state
6005336 kitara as a whole adopted the cattle and mixed agricultural pastoral economy that originated from the semliki valley constantly modified the semliki economy formed the basis of social reproduction in the batembuzi bachwezi and babito eras thus the migrants of the western stream had an extensive impact on the region
6005337 apart from the violence associated with state formation slave raiding and belgian and british colonialism coupled with the ensuing outbreak of epidemic disease also had their toll on the region
6005338 in the semliki valley epidemic diseases affecting both cattle and humans aggravated the social situation epidemic disease produced traumatic effects similar to those of warfare acting as a social brake with consequence for community and culture
6005339 despite a small number of differences in the lexical repertory of the two variants lukonzo and kinande produced after the establishment of the colonial frontier bakonzo and banande speak basically the same language and can understand each other very well
6005340 all in all the future of language use in the region looks bright except in cases where some languages and dialects could become extinct and should this happen it would be a great loss of human heritage
6005341 the endara has always been associated with kitasamba the head of the rwenzori spirits the god of the bakonzo
6005342 the endara played together with the drums has been an important magico religious instrument among the bakonzo it is not an instrument during the kubandwa thanksgiving ceremony
6005343 in conclusion we can say that while there has been substantial continuity there have also been a number of changes in the music and dance of the bakonzo due to changes in the political social and cultural environment
6005344 rwenzori presents to us an interesting area it is one of the exceptional areas where a mosaic of cultures for both indigenous and immigrant groups has converged all the groups irrespective of their sizes are worthy of respect because of their respect of their cultural values mutual or otherwise
6005345 in spite of the pressure on the resources and occasional outbreaks of ethnic conflict
6005346 mount rwenzori and the adjacent rwenzori region serve as a symbol to which all these outline cultural groups look for posterity the pastoralists will need the rivers water and pasture while the cultivator needs the soil and the hunter needs the forest and the wilderness in this way all rwenzoris cultures use the environment for cultural enrichment

6005511 our project is a response to the fact that the molecular systems people are building today are now so complex and their behavior so intricate that future progress hinges on developing the intellectual and practical tools for mastering that complexity the kinds of tools that computer science has already developed for silicon computers
6005512 the molecular programming project is one of the outputs from our investment in the information science and technology ist initiative over the years
6005513 the expeditions program is intended to identify future directions in computing that have the potential to lead to revolutionary changes the collaborations between the various investigators many of which were funded by ist were instrumental in bringing together the team of researchers who are embarking on this project

6005535 he needs to be out here more we hope to see more of him
6005536 believe what they hear from him and not what someones saying
6005537 one of the things we found in the poll even under a large number of democratic voters is that theres a concern about obamas experience
6005538 hes this hip cool guy that may feed into this concern that voters have about him

6005541 our goal is to provide a forum for focused collaboration to solve interesting and difficult performance problems tuneup gives developers deep visibility and relevant information to debug and improve the performance of their application and a community setting to collaborate with others to solve tough problems
6005542 the big cache and six cores will give customers a nice bump in performance
6005543 it looks like at least from the benchmarks were seeing that six core chips offer more performance than quad cores so yes customers are going to want them what we dont know is how much power the chips consume and how much heat they will dissipate and those are key concerns but all in all this is a pretty big advance in the state of the art and all the major vendors are on board
6005544 these chips outperform anything amd has and probably win on price performance too this could cut amds share of the server market considerably
6005545 intel doesnt have to crank up chip performance right now to thwart amd
6005546 their current products handily outperform amd on server products from my own research i can tell you that x86 server customers have moved away from amd and towards intel so intel didnt need to release this stuff now to catch up to amd or to top them but theyre doing it anyway just to keep the pressure up on amd and on themselves
6005547 if software cant take advantage of it what does it buy you
6005548 you still have software partitioning issues and when you put more cores on a chip you have to run it slower or increase the power consumption budget or thermal limitations
6005549 this was an evolutionary change to the microsoft licensing that everyone expected

6005628 here we are at gatwick airport it has suffered investment wise because baa has focused more on heathrow airport
6005629 there are problems here which go beyond the monopoly which are to do with regulation the way investment is managed the capacity at airports runway capacity and so forth and also more broadly just the absence of any kind of grand plan since baa was privatized more than two decades ago

6005634 i will legislate for these measures as soon as possible
6005635 these measures are a crucial step forward and should help clamp down on sex tourism
6005636 we have been consistently saying that when there is clear evidence a sex offender poses a risk the authorities must have effective powers to stop them from going abroad
6005637 but if they do travel there must be better systems in place to monitor and track their movements
6005638 the uk government has a crucial role to play in working more closely with other governments and police to keep sex offenders on the radar and bring those who commit sexual crimes against children to justice
6005639 these moves will help protect vulnerable children around the world from coming to harm at the hands of abusers
6005640 it is essential that we work as an international community to reach a point where there are no safe havens for those abusers and thus ensuring that a child no matter where they are growing up can be as safe as possible
6005641 pretty hard to imagine it would be legitimate for him to travel abroad again
6005642 i dont want any sex offenders in this country but the point is vietnamese officials have deported him to the uk so as we do whenever sex offenders return to this country we need to plan for what happens when people return
6005643 never mind his individual case anybody who is returning to the uk in these sorts of circumstances would be met at the airport by police officers would be served with an order which effectively puts them on to the sex offenders register
6005644 ich glaube das schaffen wir nie die wohnung wird nie nie leer
6005645 denouncing terrorism and insisting that it has no relation whatsoever with islam
6005646 the very idea of a terrorist glorying in violence and describing himself as a jihadi was denounced as an abomination
6005647 have started monitoring activities of young muslim men and women and warning their parents whenever they are found straying
6005648 the work of brotherhood members in america is a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the western civilization from within and sabotaging its miserable house by their hands and the hands of believers so that it is eliminated and gods religion is made victorious over all other religions
6005649 which has prevented muslim women wearing head coverings from being in the background of photographs with the candidate and which recently fired a muslim outreach coordinator who had ties to another unindicted hlf co conspirator

6005721 but its a different level of taste than what we saw 25 years ago its not as over the top as what we had during 80s and its clear to see designers have taken a softer approach

6005770 in the light of a weakening oil price and mixed drilling news tullows shares have fallen 31 since june

6005800 caparbiamente incline a considerare il suo pubblico ufficio una sorta di priv da utilizzare per i suoi piaceri sessuali
6005801 a luglio 2007 mi ero recata con b dal professore
6005802 quel pomeriggio ci recammo come dappuntamento nel suo studio sito allinterno della facolt mentre unaltra nostra amica d rimaneva ad aspettarci fuori della stanza
6005803 i miei registri che erano una pila enorme perch come gi detto la mia materia era associata a molte altre quindi per ogni binomio cera un registro a me riconducibile erano tenuti in custodia dal professore giordano emanuele nel suo studio ufficio che egli condivide con altri docenti li teneva lui innanzitutto perch una persona di cui mi fido in modo assoluto perch mi amico e tuttoggi mi aiuta di sua spontanea volont a sostenere gli esami nella sede di potenza e poi perch non avrei saputo a chi affidarli e dove tenerli in quanto io non ero stabile in sede ma facevo come molti dei miei colleghi la spola
6005804 nel mese di novembre 2006 fui contattata in universit a matera dal prof giordano il quale mi disse che una sua tesista molto brava aveva preso un voto basso nella mia materia inglese e mi chiese se potevo fare unintegrazione desame che poteva aumentare
6005805 conosco f per essere una nostra studentessa e per essere stata tesista del prof giordano ricordo che la studentessa si laure nella sessione straordinaria del 2007 mese marzo e che il prof giordano ci teneva molto a lei anche se non so perch infatti veniva spesso in segreteria qualche mese prima che la stessa si laureasse per sapere come era la situazione dal punto di vista degli esami se il piano di studio era completo e ricordo che parlava spesso anche con il mio collega v una volta quattro o cinque mesi prima dellesame di laurea ricordo che il prof giordano mi chiese di controllare se tutti gli statini della f erano a posto ed erano stati registrati al giss cos io andai a prendere il fascicolo personale della f dallo schedario e lo portai sulla mia scrivania sempre alla presenza del prof giordano detti uno sguardo sommario a tutti gli statini che si trovavano allinterno del fascicolo confrontandoli con quelli inseriti nel sistema giss e mi sembra che risultasse corrispondenza quantomeno numerica tra il dato cartaceo e quello informatico cio io controllai soltanto che a ciascuno statino corrispondesse la registrazione nel sistema senza controllare la corrispondenza delle date e delle votazioni non risultavano statini non registrati fatta eccezione per quelli ancora accantonati che come ho detto non potevano essere registrati nellimmediato per non essere aggiornato il piano di studi dopo questo controllo abbiamo messo a posto nello schedario il fascicolo personale della f e il giordano si rivolto ad v infatti per ulteriori e pi approfonditi controlli ci pensa v che incaricato di prendere il fascicolo personale di ogni studente poco prima della laure due tre mesi prima per verificare se tutto a posto so che giordano si rivolto pi volte a lui per la f qualche mese prima del marzo 2007 per averli visti in segreteria v anche abilitato a registrare gli statini lui conosce la mia password ma io non conosco la sua non mi mai capitato che il prof giordano abbia chiesto questi controlli per altri studenti non so se lo abbia fatto con altri miei colleghi n mi capitato di vedere docenti interessarsi al controllo degli statini visto che di solito sono gli studenti stessi ad interessarsi che tutto sia completo dal punto di vista burocratico prima della seduta di laurea

6005808 im shocked an 11 year old first of all was even out at that time let alone breaking into a gun shop
6005809 i wasnt stunned i was shocked i just could not believe that an 11 year old kid would be involved in something like this its just deplorable
6005810 its just a scary thought that in todays society kids are stealing guns like this and putting them back on the street
6005811 this is the scary underbelly of the activity thats going on that has resulted in a number of shots fired incidents aggravated assaults with firearms and in fact gunshot homicides not only here in delaware county but in philadelphia and throughout the region
6005812 these kinds of weapons on the street are the type of weapons that we frequently find used in the commission of crimes obviously violent crimes and homicides

6005837 im gegensatz zur konkurrenz stellen wir nicht unorganisiertes sondern organisiertes verbrechen dar statt nur auftr ge f r andere zu erledigen k nnt ihr sie diesmal selbst planen und ausf hren unsere devise agiere wie ein schl ger denke wie ein pate wir wollen uns mit dieser mischung platz im markt schaffen und von den mitbewerbern absetzen
6005838 das sind harte entscheidungen die dem spieler vermitteln sollen wie es ist ein don zu sein
6005839 wir haben viele verschiedene ideen ich denke all die leiter des teams haben ihre eigenen ideen wie die demo aussehen sollte es macht offensichtlich sinn wenn die probierversion vor dem release des spiels erscheint wir alle glauben dass es wichig ist weil das spiel so anders ist
6005840 es gab vier herausforderungen in der e3 demo es funktionerte gut die idee s he also so aus dass wir das haben und in irgendeiner form den editor ebenfalls integrieren weil das ein v llig unterschiedlicher teil des spiels ist die erschaffung von dingen die anschlie ende betrachtung ihrer verhaltensweise und die teilnahme an wettbewerben
6005841 die art und weise wie stop n swop urspr nglich funktionieren sollte sah so aus dass es teile im original banjo gab die sich nicht freischalteten bis das spiel registrierte dass man die fortsetzung gespielt hat das mussten wir aufgrund der hardware evolution des nintendo 64 ndern es h tte auf fr hen konsolen funktioniert aber nicht mit den sp teren
6005842 das ist der grund daf r warum wir es nie ver ffentlicht haben es war im grunde mein job diese sache zu erledigen ihr k nnt euch also gar nicht vorstellen wie viele fans mich daf r hassen was wir nun tun ist praktisch die gleiche sache es gibt freischaltbare dinge in beiden spielen die zug nglich gemacht werden sobald das spiel bemerkt dass ihr den jeweils anderen titel gespielt habt
6005843 nein es schaltet dinge frei die man nutzen kann und so weiter ich denke das ist alles was ich sagen kann
6005844 die jungs m dels von tgc sind auf dem besten weg das emotionalste spiel aller zeiten gemacht zu haben
6005845 und ihr wisst dass ich ein entt uschter zyniker bin wenn es um videospiele und das erwecken von zarten gef hlen geht
6005846 ich mag flower um einigesl mehr als flow das ich zwar sch tze aber nie wirklich als spielerlebnis genie en konnte aber dieses neue spiel es ist auf dem weg ein klassiker zu werden keine frage und das zu sagen ist nicht einfach denn w hrend die grunds tzlichen spielmechaniken spa machen lebt das spiel meiner meinung nach von den emotionen die es w hrend des spielens erweckt
6005847 und das coolste f r mich ist ich bin jetzt inspiriert mich der herausforderung zu stellen und zu versuchen auch etwas bedeutsameres zu erschaffen vielleicht nicht mit unserem jetzigen titel aber eines tages gewiss danke tgc
6005848 wir haben eng mit neversoft und activision harmonix und konami zusammengearbeitet um sicherzustellen dass die gitarren und drumsets der playstation 3 auf einem gameplay grundlevel miteinander kompatibel sind
6005849 die entwicklung eines sequels ist immer schwieriger vor allem wenn man sich das wettr sten in der spieleentwicklung betrachtet
6005850 spiele konkurrieren nicht mit der spa igen erfahrung sie konkurrieren mit der anzahl der waffen
6005851 wenn man sich vorstellt dass filme so miteinander verglichen werden w rden nun nat rlich war schindlers liste gut aber dieser dreieinhalbst ndige film denkt ber den wert nach den ihr f r eure zehn dollar erhaltet es funktioniert so nicht und dennoch vergleichen wir es auf diese art und weise wir m ssen die qualit t betrachten nicht den umfang
6005852 so sehr wir auch nicht dieses spiel call of duty hat so viele waffen und dieser titel hat so viele waffen wie viele habt ihr spielen wollen man kann diesem vergleich nicht entkommen wenn man eine fortsetzung macht jeder erwartet mehr von einem sequel man muss es
6005853 wir f rchten uns nicht davor dass wir kein wirklich besseres spiel als gears of war machen k nnen ich wei dass es sch ner schneller spa iger und wahrscheinlich auch l nger ist aber dennoch mache ich mir sorgen dar ber nicht die gleichen wertungen wie beim ersten teil zu erhalten weil jeder diese erh hten erwartungen hat immerhin entschieden wir uns daf r in sachen umfang nicht mit uns selbst zu konkurrieren sondern mit anderen wirklich neuen erfahrungen
6005854 ungl cklicherweise war dies die sache die wir von den d chern schrien wir h rten also nicht auf uns selbst und sagten dass wir unser letztes spiel nehmen und es gr er sowie besser machen wir haben uns selbst vor eine ziemliche herausforderung gestellt nat rlich haben wir sie bestanden
6005855 wenn wir ein franchise erschaffen ist das ein langfristiger vorgang wir wollen es behalten und mehrere teile ver ffentlichen weil am anfang eine gro e investition steht um es berhaupt erst ins laufen zu bringen
6005856 es ist besser wenn du ein paar franchises hast auf die du jahrelang z hlen und mit ihnen werben kannst wir hoffen dass i am alive ein weiteres starkes franchise in unserem portfolio wird neben prince of persia oder rayman rabbids es ist ein neues baby f r uns und wir haben gro e hoffnungen
6005857 what if there was a vote to decide if 13 5 billion in tax breaks for oil companies should go into oil alternatives like solar and wind what would you want your senator to do well as you probably guessed there was such a vote we needed 60 votes to prevail and 59 of them were in but john mccain ducked the vote as a result instead of powering millions of homes with clean energy and building next generation solar technology were giving exxonmobil and other companies billions in tax breaks at a time when theyre already making record profits
6005858 this was a very serious and frightening incident for these two young girls and i would like to talk to anyone who was in the area and may have witnessed the incident or who saw the man in the area before or after the incident

6005865 maybe i have gone up in the pecking order i dont know
6005866 hopefully i am closing the gap and getting better although you would have to ask the manager that
6005867 i feel confident in myself and know i can come in and do a job for the team but its down to me to play well i also have to train hard every day and then i might get my rewards
6005868 cup runs could be valuable for me but every game is a big game whether its in the league or the cup ill use any opportunity to impress the manager
6005869 i thought i did well we gave a goal away which was disappointing but we showed great character to get through

6005872 youd have to concede that having a governor from virginia running on the ticket would be of some help to obama in virginia
6005873 its hard to see how kaine would bring strength to the ticket in the national security area which i think the american public will be looking for in the selection
6005874 martinsville is the perfect place for obama to go populist he needs to talk about how the big guys have screwed the little guys and how were going to screw them back and martinsville is the best place in the world to do that
6005875 it doesnt take a lot of courage to go into martinsville and talk about trade

6005901 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world

6005913 the chinese government is desperate to turn the worlds attention away from its abuses in tibet as the olympics take place but the creativity and determination of tibetans and their supporters has once again ensured that tibetan voices are heard and seen in beijing despite the massive security clampdown
6005914 the chinese leadership must realize that the only way it can make the issue of tibet disappear is to acknowledge the demands of the tibetan people and work with them to bring an end to chinas occupation of tibet

6005922 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

6005966 first off please explain what net reflector is and what it does
6005967 reflector is a browser and analysis tool for net it allows developers to navigate search disassemble and analyze net components
6005968 like thousands of other developers i find reflector to be an indispensable tool reflector allows you to peer beyond the public api and gives the developer a chance to really understand how the underlying classes work or dont work in many cases it can save you hours when looking for a workaround to some quirk
6005969 lutz reflector is recognized by scott hanselman as one of
6005970 one of the 10 must have tools every developer should download now
6005971 i wanted to write a tool that made it easier to browse and navigate components when net was announced i started to work on reflector and kept improving it users provided lots of feedback and other developers started creating add ins to make it even more useful
6005972 ive used net reflector for years and its at the top of my list of great net tools its also one of the few tools every developer here uses so i knew i was not alone a few months ago i dropped lutz an email introducing myself and it just kind of went from there
6005973 when james emailed me and we spoke about the future of reflector and the resources red gate could make available to the project it made the decision easy for me
6005974 how can it be good news that a commercial software company is taking ownership of a free community tool
6005975 i think we can provide a level of resources that will move the tool forward in a big way the first thing we are doing is continuing to offer the software to the community for free downloading the second thing is giving our product management and usability teams the task of going out into the community to get suggestions on how we can make this amazing tool even better we accept the fact that there will be scepticism but we can point to a good track record of support for the community people were wary a couple of years ago when we purchased the sql server central community site but over time we have won over many of our critics by investing heavily in the site and boosting its readership while allowing it to maintain editorial independence im hoping i will be able to sit here in a few years time and claim the same level of success with reflector
6005976 youve already said james that net reflector is easy to use and works exactly as it should how can you improve on that
6005977 i dont know yet this is what well glean from the community we know we have a responsibility to the development community not to ruin a tool that is so widely used and so valuable to developers in their day to day jobs but we also know that red gate has the in house expertise to translate user desires into simple elegant products
6005978 will you continue to be involved with net reflector lutz
6005979 i will be using reflector and im sure i will be emailing james every so often asking for new features
6005980 over the past eight years lutz has built up a unique understanding of the net developer community i hope he will continue to provide us with valuable input into the future of net reflector
6005981 will red gate still encourage the community to write and use add ins
6005982 yes that wont change and we encourage and value all the net reflector add in writers
6005983 uh oh the pressure is on already enough talk i need to get to work

6005991 when you are a child you are always drawing colouring doing class that is totally normal and seems to be what you do as a kid i think its a kind of weird tragedy that when you become an adult you stop doing it

6005997 bijna iedereen die nieuwe software krijgt weet dat je problemen kunt verwachten het proefdraaien was goed gegaan wij waren zo arrogant om te denken dat wij ook daarna geen problemen zouden hebben de champagne stond al klaar en de eerste twee dagen ging het ook goed
6005998 toen ontstond er een klein probleempje en toen nog een voor je het eerste probleem had opgelost was je er al weer een paar duizend verder toen we probeerden de problemen te verhelpen sliepen we met zijn allen op kantoor we zijn overgestapt op handmatige verzending de pizzaboeren in de omgeving draaiden in die periode een hele goede omzet

6006011 the show really goes back to some of the fundamental relationships from season one that everyone really cared about and got excited about
6006012 after an hour of upheaval the pilot announced they would take everybody and their cases but that we would have to defuel at newcastle and refuel at verona
6006013 we all had to go back to the departure lounge but once there the newcastle ground staff came and said either 70 people would have to remain with their cases or everybody goes with no luggage and it will be sent on
6006014 they said we had five minutes to decide as the cabin crew were nearly out of flying time
6006015 why should it be spoilt unless someone tries to spoil it
6006016 im very happy with what ive done three medals from three major championships so nothing can spoil it
6006017 i dont care what people think or say im happy ive won a gold medal and thats all that matters to me
6006018 sorry but i dont know what you mean by not having ideal preparation
6006019 im very proud that we have a gold medal in athletics proud of myself ive kept my head up and kept working
6006020 i might not always get the best start i might not always be the fastest person but i just say if you are going to beat me you are going to have to fight very hard
6006021 the final is about who has the biggest will to get to the line thats life you have to learn to ride the ups as well as the downs

6006023 id have never forgiven myself if i had not kept on working
6006024 yes i did winning the world championships is not luck its down to my hard work
6006025 when it comes to it i can really work and focus my coach always says all you train for is three days and if you cannot concentrate and focus your mind on those three days then what is all the training for
6006026 thats all i train for throughout the year i hope it is something other athletes can learn from
6006027 im always a positive person no matter what things will always turn out for the best i believe im destined for great things and thats what keeps me going i just get my head down and work
6006028 shes level headed and surrounded by good people she will keep her feet on the ground
6006029 she has had her trials and tribulations and she knows how to treat it

6006031 as a nation we are getting more adventurous when it comes to our holidays and although its great to see new places its also very important that travellers understand the risks they face if they are going to a potentially dangerous destination foreign travel is so commonplace these days but wed urge anyone going on holiday this summer to pay attention to the government travel advice
6006032 aside from the obvious risks to safety the vast majority of travel insurers will not provide cover for areas that the government warns against visiting so travellers need to do their research thoroughly before booking an unusual destination
6006033 although the lv travel insurance policy will cover travellers if they fall ill with one of these diseases if they didnt get vaccinated many insurers will not meaning policy holders will have no medical cover and are at an increased risk of becoming seriously ill

6006039 this past may matts inspection found the tower was approaching poor condition due to its age and harsh environment the new tower supports our 3 element steppir yagi with a newly installed 40 30 meter dipole kit recently donated by steppir antenna systems hq staff can now enjoy these additional bands and have peace of mind with the new tower
6006040 i am pleased to report that the w1hq tower replacement and installation of the 40 30 meter dipole element on the steppir antenna was successful hq hams may now enjoy a rotating dipole for these bands at the push of a button on the steppir controller the crew from xx towers did a fine job thanks to his regular inspections we were able to avoid a more costly removal of the 50 foot 35 year old tower arrl building manager greg kwasowski w1gjk assisted with and arranged for the roofing company to remove part of the roof for the tower base and replacement after tower installation arrl lab manager ed hare w1rfi saved the day with the needed metric hardware many thanks to all involved for the successful replacement of the tower having a rotatable dipole on 30 and 40 meters is a very welcome addition to the station

6006042 ebays move to court more fixed price sellers is likely to be just as controversial as its prior changes auction sellers have argued that ebay is

6006050 it wasnt safe to be there especially with a tropical storm or hurricane nearby we didnt want to take any chances
6006051 we just wanted to be someplace safe just in case something happened
6006052 the reports can say one thing while the actual storms does something else theres always a chance of something happening
6006053 back in 2004 the cafeteria was packed there were no tables and people brought their sleeping bags for days on end

6006055 we hear about storms decreasing in force and this is where we get lulled with complacency but even if we were told to close wed still have to be on stand by just in case
6006056 mainly were concerned about that backdraft of wind and the possibility of tornados touching down
6006057 the storm can go out take an unexpected turn and come right back so with us here and the kitchen help on stand by we would all just have to make one phone call and the people could be right back

6006099 personally trying to get one on one time with the guys and make it seem like more than football creating friendships and making it comfortable for the new guys to come in for the older guys making it seem like i want to be here and i want to be the guy who wants to run the show this year the older guys want to see confidence and that is the one big thing that im trying to show i think i do have confidence i think i have a lot of it and im only going to continue to build on it now im trying to build on trust being on time reliability working with people and not being afraid to put in some extra time
6006100 hes a tough guy hes mobile for the most part he makes really good decisions that hopefully will continue to improve with more reps i look forward to him to continue developing his accuracy particularly on the deep ball
6006101 he didnt look flustered he stood in there and made the good throws made a run or two he looked very good
6006102 i do expect him to run it like andre weve got to put those expectations on him you dont say that a kid cant do something were doing the exact same thing in practice that we were doing when andre was here we havent tweaked our offense because weve go a new quarterback were running the same plays we expect him to make all the throws and so far hes done it hes been as sharp as ive ever seen him the first few days of practice
6006103 i need to worry about myself getting mentally ready for this game and acting like i have been in this position before i need to make it seem like im not a rookie and never played i need to get my mind right to where it is just natural
6006104 theyve done the same theyve approached and theyve been presented with a fifth medal were hoping to find out in a couple of days
6006105 i certainly hope it comes through the guys have all put in the same work the differences between them are just minute
6006106 its probably the best way to do it once we get back home
6006107 the best thing about those guys is theyre such a tight knit group
6006108 any one of those six guys could have been on the track and they know the four selected were lucky to be there
6006109 theres so much pressure on everybody right now and theres a few more people involved in trying to get in the chase than there probably has been in the past
6006110 and theres a lot of us that are really close from sixth to 14th one mistake can lead to pretty big failure in the next three weeks
6006111 we came up one spot short the last time probably by fault of the driver for sure
6006112 i think theres just a lot of things happening at bristol and obviously you can get caught up in somebody elses mess pretty fast and not make a mistake
6006113 i dont know that i would categorize it as scary but its just a pretty fast short track that things happen pretty fast the biggest thing you worry about is getting caught up in something that you really arent a part of
6006114 weve been running really well for at least two and a half months now we didnt have the finishes to show for everything that had been turned around the last probably three months really
6006115 you know theres just better cars better engines better everything everything just seems to be going our way now and were getting some breaks and doing things right in the shop not that we were doing them wrong before it just seems like everything is transferring over to finishes now
6006116 this has definitely been a frustrating year up and down and one that only challenges our whole team to see what were made of and i dont see that as a bad thing
6006117 we work hard drive hard and try to do the best job we can there is no pressing anything if the car has got it if ive got it if the pit crews got it then we show it and when it doesnt it doesnt
6006118 now we just dont worry about anything we can just drive as hard as we can do anything we possibly can and just go all out and thats all we can do and well see where we end up

6006121 were getting to the point i feel personally that we can win at any racetrack we go to
6006122 and our pit crew has stepped up their game that was our weakness for a long time and the guys have repeatedly week after week have worked harder and become better so yeah i feel very confident at all the race tracks we go to all of the chase tracks i feel we can compete to win at so i feel good

6006129 weve definitely been excited about the growth and embrace of technology by both voters and candidates
6006130 its been explosive its light years from 2004 youtube didnt exist four years ago and now it is being heavily used for politics
6006131 google is attempting to expand its influence over the political process to help it achieve its commercial goals
6006132 google likes to bask in self congratulatory rhetoric claiming it has the publics interests at heart its all about accessing peoples data for targeted marketing
6006133 in this us election year what information could be more important than the candidates own words to describe their views actions and platforms
6006134 as idealistic as that sounds is as idealistic as we are it is exciting all around not just for google
6006135 this new politics is disruptive upsetting old arrangements and displacing people invested in the old ways
6006136 there are no major movements or sign of a withdrawal

6006139 the commitment of all member states to the sovereignty independence and territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders
6006140 the people of abkhazia intend to ask the russian leadership to recognise abkhazia
6006141 the federation council is ready to recognise the independent status of south ossetia and abkhazia if that is what the people of these republics want and also if there is a corresponding decision by the russian president

6006144 if this team is going to use me in center more i need to be better
6006145 its uncharacteristic of me and most outfielders in the league ill take this one on me
6006146 he was throwing in the high 90s with a snake for a breaking ball
6006147 i had no idea he was going to throw me out
6006148 the way we were swinging the bats i thought it was the best option if i would get a mulligan i would have stayed at first
6006149 nine hundred and ninety nine times out of a 1 000 he catches the ball
6006150 for whatever reason it didnt happen those are balls johnny is used to catching it was a strange event
6006151 its a dangerous area its in the elbow in the tendon
6006152 we didnt expect to have more swelling you expected to have less the fact that you have more thats a concern
6006153 if theyd said my elbow was fine we wouldnt be having this press conference
6006154 no they didnt say anything they just said wear and tear of doing this 15 years theres a possibility of a tear
6006155 i want to compete theres only so much time in a career and i want to get out there help my teammates were in a great situation leading our division weve got a great chance to go to the playoffs you want to be part of that im very frustrated theres not much to do
6006156 whos my closer depends on how we match up chipper jones bats 10 for 15 against everybody in the bullpen so im going to be flipping coins out there
6006157 im considering everybody from the gulf coast league to triple a can any of yall throw
6006158 i dont know i dont have any idea whats going on there we assume we will
6006159 id have to say well have to do with what we have
6006160 the reality is true proven guys are not going to get through waivers
6006161 i believe youve got guys in that room whore going to step up the best answers in that room
6006162 nobody is going to be harder on mike than mike is because hes such a perfectionist
6006163 he doesnt miss often from that distance i did talk to him about it and i just said look weve got to move forward i dont anticipate that happening again in the future
6006164 i know how difficult that is theyre kind of dealing with the same thing were dealing with
6006165 they find a way to battle back and win these games youre not going to win them all but its nice when you do
6006166 losing billy hurts no doubt but they have great arms and we expect them to do the job and they expect to do the job
6006167 he is throwing a bullpen session saturday and we will see how it feels sunday morning
6006168 i spoke to him four or five days ago he is quite an inspiration
6006169 he needs more rest needs those days off more than he needs to be a bullpen guy right now
6006170 id prefer to be a starter but if the team needed somebody down there id do it to help the team
6006171 were getting to the point i feel personally that we can win at any race track we go to
6006172 i want somebody who has integrity whos in politics for the right reasons
6006173 i want somebody whos independent somebody whos able to tell me you know mr president i think youre wrong on this and heres why
6006174 i want somebody who is capable of being president who i trust
6006175 im a big believer in winning i dont intend to lose this election john mccain doesnt know what hes up against right now
6006176 senator obama opposes new drilling he said it wont solve our problem and that its not real he is wrong and the american people know it
6006177 i came to tell you that the work that you are doing here is essential
6006178 the best way to be loyal to your comrades is to continue your work is to raise your head to be professional
6006179 i have no doubt that we must be here i am also in shock but i tell you in good conscience that if we had to do it again i would do it again
6006180 not the patrol and the sequence of events but the choice which led me to confirm the decision of my predecessors to send the french army here
6006181 why are we here it is because here we play a part in the freedom of the the world here we are fighting against terrorism
6006182 i think i showed em they can put me in i know the protections im going to run hard no matter what put me on special teams im going to do the best that i can and im a fighter
6006183 im going to try to go out there and help the team any way i can
6006184 we have to decide on how we are going to handle that but it is a serious injury
6006185 its just a shame and i send my prayers out to kay jay right now
6006186 i was doing well all week in practice trying to show i belong here for something like this to happen im kind of down right now but i know tomorrows a new day
6006187 at least im not in kay jay harris situation god bless him with what hes about to go through
6006188 im considering everybody from the gulf coast league to triple a
6006189 in the preseason i would give you a different answer but on aug 19 you have to do what you have to do to make the playoffs it is all hands on deck
6006190 i talked with him in the locker room and said hes a lot like packer wr donald driver and i mean that with the highest compliments
6006191 ive seen a lot of guys come and go who had tremendous speed who could jump high who could bench press more than anyone in the locker room but couldnt play football
6006192 when its all said and done thats the most important thing can you play obviously laveranues has had a great career up to this point and i dont see any reason why barring some freak injury he doesnt have a wonderful five more years or however long he wants to play
6006193 i think his playmaking ability and yards after the catch ability is a lot like driver along with his experience
6006194 the important thing is to get laveranues ready for the regular season no you can be a little more cautious than you may be in the regular season you have a little more time
6006195 precautionary and making sure were really over the hump before we move too quickly
6006196 obviously he didnt do a lot yesterday we just talked through some things having him out there talking through things and having his experience cant do anything but help us
6006197 im very frustrated but theres not much for me to do
6006198 i want to play i want to compete theres only so much time in a career and i want to get out there and help my teammates were in a great situation right now were leading our division and weve got a great chance to go to the playoffs and you want to be a part of that
6006199 last to first its pretty cool one off day and i make up 16 games so im excited
6006200 you never really want to leave your team and your teammates and all that but its nice to be back in a pennant race
6006201 it was fun playing in san diego and i loved it there but im looking forward to the last month and a half here it was great last time i was here it was fun and it was exciting i had a lot of good memories then and i look forward to making some new ones
6006202 for me its kind of like the first day of spring training all over again i just want to learn my teammates and do what i can to be accepted get in a routine as quick as possible and hopefully throw some good games for them hopefully well get to the postseason and find out if its a better team than 2 years ago its how you do in october that determines how good the team is

6006218 you have to look the runner back you have young players they are going to do some things hopefully they learn from it that was a tough way for johnny to give up his only run
6006219 that runner on third base is far more important than that runner going down to first base
6006220 soto executed the play perfectly by going at the right time staying just behind encarnacion and out of his peripheral vision until he threw to first base
6006221 the wind plays tricks here plus the lights came in to play this is a tough outfield to play still i thought i had it because i saw it all the way
6006222 we tried to be greedy and try to get the runner at second base and that opened the gates for four runs
6006223 a team like the cubs an offensive team you cant give them any extra outs because they know how to capitalize
6006224 thats as good as johnny has thrown since the beginning of the year
6006225 he gave up two leadoff doubles in a row third and fourth and didnt give up anything but then he gave up a leadoff triple in the fifth and its hard to keep getting out of that kind of trouble
6006226 the guys told me before the game i was facing good hitters and i told them i dont care im going to throw a good game i lost and i feel good but i threw one of my best games this year
6006227 i was hoping it would be before fasting month but it cant
6006228 being around the guys is a real good distraction and really helps take my mind off everything
6006229 i love what i do and this gives me an opportunity to do what my dad would want me to do
6006230 this was important to him and he said he watched every game it was part of his routine he was a hard worker too one of those guys who did it every single day then come looking forward to watching my game
6006231 i got a lot done saturday and sunday a lot of extra everything im happy i got those two pinch hit at bats and plenty of other stuff
6006232 i like to have one to take pressure off my bullpen but its hard to get one when pitch counts are high
6006233 reminds me of my last year in chicago when i had one very similar there were 80 some starts of five innings or less
6006234 a bunch of starts by first year players 37 starts by rookie pitchers this year
6006235 they all seem to have one big high count inning and what it has done is put a whole bunch of pressure on the bullpen
6006236 its those starts of five innings or less that kill you
6006237 he is from just up the river from cincinnati and was a reds fan and wanted to pitch for the reds before he was drafted by arizona baker said
6006238 considering what edinson has done 15 5 2 73 era on a team not in first place last place he should get consideration
6006239 weve had at least four public hearings on the walgreens
6006240 one tree a year has died as more and more water got into my back yard
6006241 i certainly feel better as far as the impacts are concerned
6006242 i do think we have an interpretational slippery slope about when wetlands can be filled and when they cannot
6006243 the developers report insinuates that a company can just come in and fill a wetland and then just build another one in mitigation
6006244 this is what the planning board has approved in the past and we have to ask ourselves if there is a new standard now
6006245 one of the questions was what does this mean to me
6006246 it will not decrease property values in many cases it will enhance value
6006247 five units in less than an acre of land a contractor cant do that why should a special interest group get to do it that is discrimination
6006248 i like most of us want more work force affordable housing however this ordinance as proposed is not the answer
6006249 we can have a lot of discussions about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin which is where i think a lot of this discussion is going
6006250 the bottom line for me is that communities make decisions whether or not they want to be a welcoming place this is one of those decisions i hope you will allow this ordinance to be presented to the people and we can have these kinds of discussions
6006251 the real question is where you stand on zoning density do you prefer to keep york zoning exactly as it is or to provide a home for people who work in town
6006252 how very good and pleasant it is to live together as brothers and sisters in unity let us have unity and move this ordinance to the people to vote up or down
6006253 there are variants in the wording but this ordinance wants to build at a density of 3 000 square feet per unit
6006254 i keep saying yup we have to do something about the density but it the ordinance hasnt had the changes
6006255 if you dont make the changes dont expect to shout us down to vote for an ordinance that we or i speak for myself i dont agree with
6006256 it can be perceived as something that will change the character of our neighborhoods it can be perceived as detrimental
6006257 we really need paper products like tissues and toilet paper and baby food
6006258 there is a desperate need for food pantries in the area
6006259 the holidays seem to be when people start giving food but i say dont wait just for the holidays
6006260 my kids come into the apartment and they say its damp smelling
6006261 its a little better in the winter when the heats on but its all the time
6006262 i talked with patricia martine the director of the yha several times and she insisted there was no mold
6006263 yes at times they look at me like i dont know what im talking about at times they have not been responsive
6006264 im happy my experience has been nothing but good the office always responds when i call
6006265 we needed to get a better handle on our stormwater
6006266 our information wasnt as accurate as we wanted it to be
6006267 theres also a credit crisis oil dealers wont be able to carry the load in winter any more and allow people to pay in the summer
6006268 if it seems too good to be true it probably is
6006269 and half the people in the commodities market have nothing to do with the oil industry we as a country do not know how much of this is going on
6006270 we dont know who the speculators are what if its a sovereign fund of iraq or iran it could be that theyre in there to injure the economy of the u s
6006271 put it in the roof you cant have too much insulation
6006272 as neither kittery nor wells ogunquit is in an approved configuration i believe there is an opportunity for the two school systems to explore combining central offices sharing resources and administering functions such as special education transportation facilities and maintenance from a single office through an rsu regional school unit or an aos alternative organizational structure
6006273 this would not be the first example of non contiguous units coming together
6006274 i have a real issue with this because the commissioner is forcing this on us and it wont save any money
6006275 i cant see spending any more time on this its not helping education its hurting it
6006276 im concerned that well go down this path again and not be any further ahead
6006277 the commissioner is holding wells out in order to fix kittery
6006278 it was done for political reasons and for budget reasons they tried to sell a program that didnt have the savings they promised
6006279 one payroll system for the state would have saved a heck of a lot more money than all this has
6006280 if the focus is on the money side it should have been kept on the money side
6006281 wells size allows them to be their own rsu or to be exempt from the consolidation requirement
6006282 im concerned that two weeks after the wells ogunquit combination falls through well get this same letter with another districts name in it
6006283 reached out grabbed her bag and punched her in the face
6006284 there was no physical attempt to pull her into the vehicle
6006285 theres also a credit crisis oil dealers wont be able to carry the load in winter any more and allow people to pay in the summer
6006286 if it seems too good to be true it probably is

6006291 there was no physical attempt to pull her into the vehicle
6006292 il est un peu cher et un autre club anglais le veut galement
6006293 cest tr s important davoir un entra neur qui conna t d j ses joueurs sachant que cela va aller tr s tr s vite dans quelques semaines puisque ce sera d j les qualifications pour la coupe du monde 2010
6006294 on verra le 6 et le 10 septembre ndlr apr s tout est ouvert
6006295 je suis dautant plus motiv que je suis sous pression
6006296 on an occasion of this kind it becomes more than a moral duty to speak ones mind
6006297 then we need she who knows him well dont we
6006298 yeah hes so goal oriented hed treat doctors to girly bars to help him get a sale
6006299 but thats just normal sop with most med reps you know and lets not forget his most helpful award he got from his elementary years hes real proud of that award
6006300 well i did remember him saying he wants to help those poor dancing bar girls he met while hes on his rounds
6006301 yeah he said if he ever wins the lotto hell gather all of them in one place and thats it
6006302 whatever he is he sure is passionate about whatever he does
6006303 hes so fired up about his work he delivered his sales spiel at debs despedida
6006304 and lets not forget about his passion for driving i believe we became very religious that day he drove us home
6006305 schroo even mentioned getting life insurance as soon as we got out
6006306 driving skills aside at least hes sweet and thoughtful or tries to be
6006307 thoughtful oh yeah tell him the albatross bathroom deodorizer he gave me at my birthday is still preserved
6006308 funny youre calling him thoughtful and sweet now because thats not what you thought of him before when he gave you those dried flowers
6006309 remember that one valentines that you thought he doesnt care because he didnt even bothered to greet you but then suddenly he showed up in your office with a bunch of weeds for a present
6006310 before i met her i was a smart ass punk whos always in the center of brawls and drinking bouts but when she came into my life she gave me hope that i could be better someday and i held into that hope for as long as i can you know what she changed me and im glad she did
6006311 whatever it is that youre going to write about just make it funny
6006312 i dress like a rorschach inkblot test i have as much consistency as a revolving door they say i have too much of an imagination i say the world has pavloved me into retreating to my cotton candy thoughts whenever everything starts getting too crazy or worse too dull
6006313 our vision of york beach is to make it an attractive friendly community center
6006314 it became clear that most of the objections came from residential people that abutted the businesses
6006315 the zoning doesnt match the pattern down there youve got a village thats over 100 years old theres an established pattern thats pedestrian oriented the goal is really to say we kind of like that pattern lets make that the institutionalized norm
6006316 it will substantially increase the revenue to the owner than what they see today
6006317 the situation could have been a lot worse hes lucky
6006318 past experience shows these things get out of hand and people come who are not welcome
6006319 on a choisi une musique entra nante un peu joyeuse et surtout hors du commun
6006320 on a une trame chor graphique sur un th me les poup es raconte apolline 21 ans la strasbourgeoise qui pr pare un bts en management des unit s commerciales muc il y a une partie poup es de chiffon une partie poup es m caniques et une partie pantins ca nous permet dexploiter des nergies diff rentes sur les longueurs on termine par les poup es m caniques avec des mouvements plus saccad s

6006330 sigue creando empleo a un nivel similar a la media nacional
6006331 one of the questions was what does this mean to me
6006332 it will not decrease property values in many cases it will enhance value
6006333 five units in less than an acre of land a contractor cant do that why should a special interest group get to do it that is discrimination
6006334 i like most of us want more work force affordable housing however this ordinance as proposed is not the answer
6006335 we can have a lot of discussions about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin which is where i think a lot of this discussion is going

6006337 the real question is where you stand on zoning density do you prefer to keep york zoning exactly as it is or to provide a home for people who work in town
6006338 how very good and pleasant it is to live together as brothers and sisters in unity let us have unity and move this ordinance to the people to vote up or down
6006339 there are variants in the wording but this ordinance wants to build at a density of 3 000 square feet per unit

6006342 it can be perceived as something that will change the character of our neighborhoods it can be perceived as detrimental
6006343 i think i am just going to end it there dave spoke to many of the points i had
6006344 we are making real and substantial gains in efficiency and when you put them across a fleet that travels the equivalent of 200 trips to the moon every year that can make a big difference

6006373 the question is reaching as many people as we can
6006374 its the legislators who will be deciding who the delegates are
6006375 they will be the ones who decide what questions get raised in the convention and if anything happens at all
6006376 the state constitution works and theres already a procedure in place to amend it without holding a taxpayer funded convention

6006378 we will continue to point out to the commission the many areas where we believe its analysis is flawed and its remedies would be disproportionate and counter productive
6006379 the commission risks delaying that delivery of new runways and making better customer service less not more likely

6006425 the jet stream has been further south this summer which brings wet weather to the uk also we are seeing the effects of a la nina event in the south pacific which cools the water down there and can bring about heavy rain in the uk
6006426 there are elements there that you could see as the result of climate change but you cannot put it on one incident like the flooding over the weekend
6006427 nobody will say if this is due to climate change or not the uncertainties are so much that you cannot be specific about a single incident
6006428 this is to do with the positioning of the jet stream and it being a little bit further south than normal it is this that gets the low pressure which brings the rain and this is much more of a technical issue which you cannot say is to do with climate change
6006429 to say they are to do with climate change is not something you can do but what you can say is that the effect is due to mans activity and building
6006430 it is vastly different from climate change but it gives us a glimpse of what may be to come how are people going to change their behaviour with what climate change will bring it is a glimpse of the situation that may occur in the future
6006431 this is not something governments can do 100 but we do ask for good guidance what we want to do is make people better prepared for what could happen
6006432 there are a number of simple things we can do on an individual basis things like flood proofing there are simple plastic boards that you can buy which slot into the doors and raise the level by about two inches these are inexpensive things people can do individually to protect their homes
6006433 most road systems and planning takes into account the one in 100 years theory this means that there will be an incident of this severity once in every 100 years what is worrying is the frequency is becoming higher than this
6006434 this is a shocking event a brand new road and this is what happens on its first trial
6006435 i think the issue is with maintenance systems and monitoring of drainage there is a cost to this and that needs to be recognised if you have to check the drainage systems more often then it has to be paid for from the public purse but this has to be balanced against the enormous costs of flooding this is not just financial but emotional for people who have to clear out their homes
6006436 i dont think blame is the solution we need to find answers it comes back to cost and reaction speed to heavy rain theres a financial equation and this is why climate change is beginning to bother people we are seeing more of these events and therefore the cost must be rising
6006437 even if we hadnt had the amount of rain we have had over the last month there still would have been flooding it is the worst august we have had and could turn out to be the wettest month of the year
6006438 the ground just cannot take any more water at the moment
6006439 we might even have some dry days by the end of the week
6006440 seit dem rauchverbot stinkt es ekelhaft nach schwei und auch nach versch ttetem bier in meiner stamm disco das war fr her nicht so
6006441 aber es ist die frage ob wir solche zust nde wie in versailles bekommen
6006442 the belfast waterfront is an unbelievable venue and we had big crowds for virtually every match
6006443 that sort of arena and atmosphere makes me play better it brings the best out of me you see all the people watching and getting involved and it makes you want to put on a good match for them
6006444 it was so important to me to win it last year because i hadnt won a tournament for three years and id forgotten what it was like to pick up a trophy
6006445 i had one of the hardest draws you can get playing all of the up and coming players around my age and i had some cracking matches
6006446 i want to stay in the top two in the rankings and win at least one more tournament he added
6006447 there are a couple of shots i cant play at the moment but it should be perfect by the time we go to belfast ill have no excuses
6006448 stephen was as usual helping his brother in england when samuel suffered that fatal accident while competing at blenheim international horse trials on september 7 1997
6006449 stephen was such a kind generous warm hearted unassuming person many of us probably underestimated him as a person and as a horseman
6006450 after sams tragic death in 1997 we all admired stephens determination and courage to come home and take over sams business at drumeen lodge and continue in the sport which robbed him of his brother
6006451 along with his cousin nigel and a few friends he organised the sam moore fund which supports a variety of safety initiatives in various equestrian disciplines as well as covering the cost of paramedic cover at all our northern region one day events
6006452 a lot of the objectors want it restored to the diana dors era
6006453 but that would cost 8m 10m before you even start weve done as much as we can for the objectors and moved a long way from our original proposals
6006454 it would seem the only thing the dup sinn fein axis can agree on is finding new ways of wasting money and wasting time
6006455 it is ironic that the provisional title of this magazine is changing times as for the people of northern ireland there is nothing new about dup and sinn fein bickering
6006456 ravenhill was really great the weather was good which was a surprise the crowd were fantastic and i think they will be a big advantage
6006457 leaving australia i never expected id have to play queensland so its a good little treat and it should be quite exciting
6006458 theyll be very fit they have been playing with the new elvs at super 14 and club level so theyll be ready and they will be some guys looking to get contracts so they will be really fired up
6006459 i always wanted to come to ireland this super 14 season wasnt as good as my last and i really wanted to keep going forward
6006460 matts reputation as a coach proceeded him and id known steve from playing with him during his last year at northampton and id learnt quite a bit of him then so it was a good transition
6006461 carlo del fava is an international ryan caldwell is a future international and filo paulo is a fantastic young talent so trying to squeeze in there is going to be tough all four of us want to start and were all going to put our hands up and that will be better for ulster
6006462 my granny was 86 years of age and she had a long life yes but she died a horrible death
6006463 there didnt seem to be any attempts at that stage to isolate the ward or other patients a few occasions when people had visitors in and they would come over to talk to us and you felt like saying go away please stand away from us but we didnt know what to do for the best we felt very strongly at the fact that other families were not aware
6006464 staff are running with limited resources but they need to be more upfront with families and make families aware
6006465 our priority is to get the patient isolated as soon as possible
6006466 we were really delighted with the huge number of nominations received as well as the exceptionally high standard of nominees
6006467 everyone who received a nomination should be very pleased and those who have made it onto the shortlists should realise what a huge vote of confidence it is as all the nominations were made by clients peers and even fans
6006468 david sent me a message when i was over there hes over the moon and hes delighted for me my brother richard who was over with me kept pushing me and said keep at it
6006469 its the first time its ever been won back to back by two brothers i was delighted when i was standing on stage and looked down and saw the northern ireland supporters going clean mad
6006470 we have enough offensive players already like robbie like doyle like duff like mcgeady hunt and keogh
6006471 all the strong teams in the world in europe the midfield players are very strong they can work hard they can play they can support strikers we need strong players in midfield and this is why i think about steven reid
6006472 its up there with the strongest weve had in my time its certainly as strong as it has been in the past five years you look around the squad and theres a lot of quality a lot of players in the premier league which is great
6006473 i think we have a good chance of making it to the world cup yes its a tough group but we have a chance as much as everyone else
6006474 it just hasnt been good enough its as simple as that
6006475 as players you have to take responsibility both as an individual and as a team its a team game and we have to look after each other if we dont do that then we havent got a chance
6006476 after three years plus working on this project to finally see this baby on the shelf is very very exciting and knowing that its good stuff too
6006477 were an unknown brand really at this point we dont want to be a smirnoff
6006478 we want to be known for being locally made with local produce wed like to be appreciated for being small
6006479 more people will see it more in bars and restaurants than in the state stores
6006480 theyre willing to pay a little bit more for a finer crafted project i think thats what boyd amp blair are trying to go for
6006481 for the consumers theyre trying to hit it will do real well
6006482 its clear this is a game that fans of our titles have been eagerly anticipating
6006483 before revealing the project our upcoming announcement online forum received more than 14 000 page views in less than 24 hours with a third installment of hearts of iron seemingly being at the top of everyones wish list
6006484 the survey work to be performed by marine m tteknikk ab will provide essential data for the transport routes to be further developed during the pre engineering phase due to commence in the first quarter of 2009
6006485 de iraanse president mahmoed ahmadinejad is het mooiste cadeau dat je isra l kon geven want hij dient de isra lische belangen door er in te slagen de hele wereld tegen zich op te zetten
6006486 een man als ahmadinejad aan de macht brengen in teheran de mossad zou het niet beter gekund hebben
6006487 mijn ellebogen uit het water halen zonder stevige beenslag is het moeilijkst maar ook de concurrentie zelf is hard want iedereen wil natuurlijk de kortste weg nemen
6006488 ik herinner me nog dat hij tevoorschijn kwam en met een accent zei no no ik draaide me om en liep terug naar het gebouw
6006489 hij sprak dan wel engels maar zag er portugees uit
6006490 challenging some of the fundamental tenets of the existing global economic system
6006491 i have family members who are losing their houses their jobs i think people need to get excited about the future
6006492 sometimes we dont see the products until the public does
6006493 people always say we need new products all the time
6006494 maybe it wasnt the way you plan on having a daughter but no one can question how much she means to him its just a shame he had to go through that again
6006495 for him to be able to overcome everything hes been through it just seems obvious that these obstacles placed on his life were put there for this moment
6006496 what really got to me was the promise i made to kaedyn when i lost i felt like i broke that promise and that got to me
6006497 i broke down im a strong guy but that burden that was too much for me to shoulder
6006498 ive changed a lot of things in my life that have improved my wrestling but the biggest thing i had to confront was not carrying that gorilla on my back anymore i wrestle for me now i have to do that to be successful
6006499 i was in the dark on a lot of things
6006500 hes come to grips with that loss and hes in a different place now in a lot of ways now when he does win though the death of his daughter and his love for her still motivate him he does it for daniel that burden being taken off his shoulders has really allowed him to reach a level he wasnt at before
6006501 the bottom line is this theres a price you have to pay and a line that has to be crossed to be the very best in the world
6006502 it wasnt easy for daniel because of all the other things he was dealing with but hes done it daniels commitment to these games is in the bank all thats left is to cash in
6006503 it wasnt something we talked about but it certainly put things in perspective for my life
6006504 daniels an amazing story with an incredible inner strength to overcome what he has but ill tell you what ive checked up on him with olympic team coaches and its obvious hes ready
6006505 i know how great daniel is hes a hammer and i think that hammers going to drop on his opponents in beijing think about it in 2004 he was one win away from a medal with all the turmoil its his time now
6006506 i hate to say someone owes daniel for everything hes been through but someone does
6006507 i dont know if hell win but if he does theyll probably have to arrest me ive watched my son go through too much and if he wins theres just too much locked up inside me im not sure ill be able to control myself
6006508 you learn and grow through all the experiences and ive certainly done that things that have happened and affected my life ive learned to live with both good and bad
6006509 but right now i feel like ive put myself in a position to do something special in beijing

6006520 i had butterflies in my stomach before the last race
6006521 but once i got started i was only focused on getting ahead of everybody else it went very well tactically and i enjoyed the last part of the race as i knew a medal was assured

6006523 cat with four ears a target for catnappers this four eared cat is so rare that his owners keep him indoors to prevent him getting catnapped
6006524 its always nice to score three goals and the whole team contributed to them and to the win hopefully we can go the next step and win again on tuesday night
6006525 im obviously delighted with the result and it is fantastic to open the season with a win we always knew we would have to work very hard to get something from this fixture but the squad know that there are many things we can improve on we now have two home games in the space of a few days which we need to take the confidence that we have gained from today into those matches
6006526 that is not so it is a myth we have a lot of problems a lot of people are left behind
6006527 the reality is we have a broken system because we dismantled primary care
6006528 we need a reimbursement system to help give doctors an incentive to practice primary care and rural care
6006529 we need to comb through these complexities im optimistic about the future yes we have problems and challenges
6006530 my inspiration comes from my parents generation they had the courage to seek out human possibility through the abject poverty of the great depression they took on the nazis they made the u s a beacon of hope im inspired by what we have already done and im absolutely positive we will find the best way forward
6006531 in light of this case further inquiries into the trusts protocols were undertaken to ensure the training and actions of staff are appropriate at all times
6006532 estamos donde quer amos estamos preparados para la semifinal porque seguro que ser un partido duro esperaba salir con esta intensidad defensiva hab a que entrar a tope e imprimir nuestro ritmo porque si empezamos como hoy eso nos quita presi n en ataque y nos da ventaja
6006533 estoy contento por estar en las semifinales nos quedan dos partidos importantes y estamos preparados para llegar a la final china o lituania son dos rivales muy duros china tiene un jugador desequilibrante duro y lituania tiene mucho talento y si le dejas jugar son muy dif ciles de ganar
6006534 intentamos competir contra ellos pero imprimieron una intensidad de juego a la que no est bamos acostumbrados y nos cogieron en un momento an mico malo an micamente ya nos estamos recuperando despu s del partido de angola y el de hoy aunque ahora s lo pienso en la semifinal
6006535 lo mejor de cada uno no s lo de forma individual sino en lo f sico

6006555 based on the recommendation from nwn we looked very hard at netapp as the potential storage provider for burts bees

6006566 piri is an outstanding rugby player and to have him play in new zealand is fantastic for us
6006567 he has represented new zealand at the highest level and he has been an influential player for his province and franchise as well
6006568 we are delighted that rugby will continue to benefit from his talent and experience
6006569 piri has a major role to play with both the hurricanes and the vodafone wellington lions
6006570 at the age of just 24 he has already earned an astonishing 56 caps for the hurricanes 41 for the vodafone wellington lions and 22 for the all blacks with plenty more to come
6006571 i needed to convince myself that this was cost effective since i use it to commute to work year round rain or shine the following yearly savings justified my purchase
6006572 attached are pics of my new burley flatbed trailer which i attached and tested with a load of instruments for 4 1 2 miles yesterday the bike performed
6006573 this is the first time ive had an electric bike where i am confident to jump on and do errands without fear of running out of battery power
6006574 my goals at the start of this year were to make the top 70 in the money list and try and win an event
6006575 it didnt look as though i would get them for while but now if i keep playing the way i am i might have a chance
6006576 hopefully i get to play two maybe three of them this year with these playoffs if you get hot at the right time you could go all the way
6006577 i had no confidence and then my coach came out to the john deere classic and we got some things sorted out in my swing

6006600 i cant say anything concrete since i dont really know myself the situation
6006601 everything is still being discussed maybe spartak have already made a decision but i havent decided one way or the other
6006602 moreover the transfer to england which everyone is talking about would be a big problem for my family as we have a young child so we need to discuss it properly
6006603 i dont know because i have never been at a foreign club you need to try something first in order to know
6006604 on the one hand its easier as a pair but on the other alone the situation forces you to get used to new conditions quicker both language and life
6006605 everything will depend on what kind of offer will be made to the club and to me my move to a top club definitely would reflect well on the image of spartak
6006606 you have to get a buzz out of it alright and i did to win an award like that against the all ireland champions
6006607 but to be quite honest it was all about winning a munster title that was more important looking at things at half time it was difficult to see a way through to pull it out of the fire like we did we were just delighted after
6006608 i suppose thats how we will be judged we know what were up against we havent done as well as wed have liked against them
6006609 we didnt perform really results would show that even though going into the games we thought we could beat them its hard to say why theyre a very good side their results have proven that putting back to back all irelands together
6006610 i dont think there is baggage really obviously these things linger in your mind i was just a sub though certainly id remember the games but i dont think theres a whole load of baggage
6006611 tthis team has been going for the last four or five years weve an amount of experience weve got to a good few semi finals in a row a final last year so its no flash in the pan setanta readers comment of the day
6006612 a champion of the democratisation of the sadc region in particular and the african continent in general as such his passing on is a sad day to the zimbabwean people who at this stage are yearning for a new beginning which can unquestionably be characterised as democratic and a reflection of the will of the people
6006613 it is believed that president robert mugabe will proceed to convene parliament soon and form a new government on the basis of the agreement with mutambara that was endorsed by the sadc leadership

6006615 i know valencia because weve done several tests here last winter but now were racing in the city on a new track im sure it will be a great atmosphere

6006617 i hope ill have a trouble free weekend to try to set up the car the best way possible especially for the qualifying lap the qualifying will be extremely important although i think that there are some possibilities on the track to overtake
6006618 again this season shows that you should never give up
6006619 there were some races where things didnt go well but for one reason or the other i was able to collect some precious points
6006620 i think that the outcoming of the championship will be very tight with ferrari and mclaren very close together in terms of performance and three drivers in a position to win the title

6006711 man in ten or fifteen years there wont even be such a thing as a screen actor theyll all be cvps
6006712 a cvp is a character voice performer man with the way computer generated images are advancing therell be no need for screen actors the only place youll see one of those self centered idiots is in a play why just think of all the money movie producers will be able to save by cutting out all human actors i cant wait
6006713 but youre right ill bet there wont even be any cvps the director will be able to manipulate even the voices which will also be computer generated
6006714 theres going to be a lot of bitching and moaning from the left coast
6006715 big deal times change you dont see folks bitching about the death of silent movies black and white television or 8 track tapes do you
6006716 yeah part you only said what everyone else really thinks you radical non conformist
6006717 radical non conformist im probably the most conforming person alive i mean im right smack in the middle of the bell shaped political curve
6006718 see today if youre a middle of the roader youre a radical you need to either be red or blue in your political views
6006719 but i cant completely support either party i mean im for tax cuts pro abortion pro universal health care and believe in a strong military
6006720 im also for closing the borders i mean if the chinese could do it to keep out the rampaging mongols why cant we
6006721 so youre saying we mexicans are a bunch of rampaging mongrels
6006722 mongols no no thats not what i meant i was just trying to make a point
6006723 i just think affirmative action should be based on economic need not on skin color
6006724 hey youre ancestors brought mine over in chains ill take all the affirmative action i can get
6006725 come on i know you dont believe that besides my ancestors were poor irish immigrants
6006726 ah ha i knew it your ancestors made life for my ancestors a living hell stealing their jobs and making them sit in the back of the bus maybe you are a racist
6006727 look i believe in what doctor king said about judging someone by the content of their character and not by the color of their skin
6006728 can we change the subject before i jam my foot any deeper into my mouth
6006729 you should you wetback you see pool was created by and for the elite today the privileged play billiards theyve hidden their racism by making all the balls the same color but here in the south home of the rebel flag chewing tobacco and red necks
6006730 you see here in the south the number one pool game is eight ball now think about it whats the object of the game
6006731 to clear your balls from the table and then pocket the eight before your opponent does
6006732 you know a cappo thats italian for chief you know like in those nazi concentration camps where theyd bribe an inmate to do their dirty work in exchange for extra food in this case im playing for extra money

6006748 sure my blood runs with aztec heritage ah the good old days of bare breasted women human sacrifices and drug induced visions why
6006749 i had a really weird dream last night want to hear it
6006750 sure you know im very good at reading the signs and interpreting dreams
6006751 okay well in mine i was in a skiff with two other men my wife was sitting on the fantail of a yacht drinking beer while the captain tried to hit on her
6006752 yeah anyway were pulling away from the yacht when we run into a thirteen foot shark somehow were able to capture the shark and tie a long rope to its tail we drag it around the marina in between other boats until we round a dock and run through a herd of manatees
6006753 we need to drag the shark out into deeper water so we continue through the marina weaving in and out of the boats now im sitting in the bow and can see that were heading straight towards the white stern of one of the yachts we hit it punching a good size hole in it im able to push us away only to have the shark begin to drag us backward waters rushing over the stern filling up the skiff
6006754 so anyway one of the two guys im with begins bailing out the water the other guy kicks up the throttle raising the bow and we move forward again now heres the weird part
6006755 yeah so were moving between two really large yachts so large that its like were driving down a canyon we come to a spot where one of the anchor chains blocks our way so i lean forward grab the anchor chain and try to muscle the skiff around it all of a sudden i see a rattle snake slithering up the anchor chain i watch as it moves higher then when it reaches my eye level it coils and springs right toward my face man i couldnt believe it all i saw were long curved fangs like daggers sticking out of its huge white mouth then i woke up weird huh
6006756 people are operating on assumptions of what old is and what elderly patients need
6006757 we were surprised that this was a recurrence of something we saw in the late 1990s this is something we have to revisit periodically

6006761 no one ever admits they have a bias they say they know someone who does something biased
6006762 basically its difficult to get a handle on what bias is so instead of defining bias we wanted to show that people behaved differently and find a way to fix the problem
6006763 sometimes the younger doctors see a person being evaluated and it turns out to be negative and the patient is sent home
6006764 part of the problem is everybodys got aches and pains its hard to tell is that a broken hip or something else
6006765 wouldnt it be great if people who had access to the internet in far flung places and were seeing something unusual could send an email to this list we wouldnt have to wait for a public health laboratory to notify the under minister of health who would notify the minister who would notify the world health organization we would all know at once
6006766 while the british public is having to tighten its belts the government is spending taxpayers money on a completely frivolous project
6006767 this shows how detached the labour party has become from the concerns of the british people
6006768 it was a pretty light hearted petition so we gave it a light hearted answer

6006774 we decided to open our network to external bloggers so that they can also enjoy some of our network benefits including but not limited to traffic ad sales technology and networking with our great members

6006781 this is by far the most exciting cast we have in over 13 years of shooting live action movies for command amp conquer
6006782 the caliber of the performances we received both individually and collectively have really raised the storytelling bar for the franchise we are really excited that we will be delivering such a high quality production that is on par with movies and television shows
6006783 i wasnt sure what to expect when i came in to work on a video game
6006784 what i realized is red alert 3 is not just a video game its absolutely an interactive movie this is where the people at home get to move the story forward and where seeing the plot thicken is a reward for a job well done and thats really cool
6006785 i think video games are one of the new frontiers for actors and using live action is just another way to connect more easily to the gamer rather than cg or animation techniques
6006786 to be in a groundbreaking game like red alert 3 where we are using full on shooting of live actors and to be with jonathan pryce tim curry and peter stormare it was a great opportunity for a character actor like me to have some fun

6006799 we have two other projects that we are working on for christmas so we are pretty busy
6006800 the important thing is that were targeting mobile gamers so we are adapting the gameplay for mobile
6006801 we want kroll to be accessible to everybody the theme may be fantasy but we need to combine that with gameplay that is quite simple and works with the interface we have learned that you cant just throw a pc game onto mobile and expect it to work well
6006802 n gage wasnt a console it had a wider audience so for the sequel we decided to change it you cant play this kind of game with one thumb so we went with two thumb controls its working pretty well the inspiration was the nintendo game boy with the cross pad and two buttons
6006803 weve made the combos much more simple and worked a lot on the story mode
6006804 but we have other innovative features in there too like bluetooth which is working really well
6006805 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6006806 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6006807 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6006808 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6006809 let you and him fight international brigage these past two years or so but boy did the war for south ossetia bring them back
6006810 we have occasionally described the henry jackson society in the past as the
6006811 as weve seen throughout the primary season technology is playing an increasingly critical role in the electoral process microsoft will help ensure that both parties delegates are able to take full advantage of the benefits that todays technologies offer
6006812 this time around we are supplying both parties with some very innovative technology such as interactive displays portable music players and high definition video streaming
6006813 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6006814 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6006815 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6006816 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6006817 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6006818 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6006819 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6006820 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6006821 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6006822 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6006823 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6006824 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6006825 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6006826 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6006827 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6006828 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6006829 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6006830 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6006831 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6006832 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6006833 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6006834 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6006835 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6006836 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6006837 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6006838 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6006839 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6006840 who are open to doing something on the production side
6006841 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6006842 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6006843 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6006844 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6006845 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6006846 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6006847 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6006848 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6006849 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6006850 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6006851 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6006852 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6006853 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6006854 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6006855 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6006856 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6006857 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6006858 make sure to play some of reset generation s story mode tutorial before going online your online opponents will be too busy stealing your princess to coach you
6006859 combos are everything in reset generation i see most new players using their cannons exclusively to protect items dont use your cannons to disrupt your opponents combos
6006860 monster boxes can have a huge effect on the balance of power use them whenever you can and dont let your opponents monsters run free or gang up on you a single blockapede left unchecked can quickly fill the playing field with opponent combos
6006861 if there is an item that you definitely need on your next turn you can protect it by shooting both your cannon balls at it
6006862 dont forget that eggs can be tossed at an opponent even a small amount of damage to an opponent can force them to drop the princess and turn the tide in your favour
6006863 after the game starts do your best to create some combos asap without combos you wont get items and well you will lose quickly
6006864 super stuffer there are times when you might actually want to avoid making combos every time you make a combo it adds to your opponents super meter if it looks like you are about to win dont make combos unless you absolutely need to otherwise you might end up powering your opponent to a surprise victory
6006865 the monster stop youre playing hedgehog and you have a full super meter and a monster box is nearby toss the monster out in front of you so that when you hog ride the monster acts as a break this is a good way to hog ride into your castle while holding a princess
6006866 most surprising move ever using the sci fi knight sci fi mind trick an opponent into rescuing your princess guaranteed to drop jaws but not very good for your ranking
6006867 illegal filesharing is a very serious issue resulting in millions of pounds of losses to copyright owners
6006868 the damages and costs ordered by the court are significant and should act as a deterrent this shows that taking direct steps against infringers is an important and effective weapon in the battle against online piracy
6006869 oh man i wish i could kick that kind of ass
6006870 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6006871 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6006872 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6006873 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6006874 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6006875 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6006876 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6006877 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6006878 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6006879 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6006880 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6006881 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6006882 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6006883 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6006884 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6006885 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6006886 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6006887 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6006888 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6006889 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6006890 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6006891 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6006892 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6006893 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6006894 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6006895 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6006896 lo so per questo te ne parlo ho bisogno di qualcuno di cui fidarmi a occhi chiusi potresti essere tu ti do unopzione fino al dieci per cento del capitale
6006897 prendi un bicchiere avvocato alla tua salute tu hai capito tutto
6006898 quando penso a te un po ti mando a quel paese un po mi dico che avevi ragione merde lazienda fa profitti un ragioniere direbbe che un successo e invece al capolinea non ci sono pi margini per espandersi non vale la pena di fare investimenti c solo da tirare i remi in barca fare cabotaggio sopravvivere
6006899 non ce la faccio pi ci vorrebbe la grinta di un giovane ma in una azienda senza prospettive vengono solo gli smidollati quelli che lavorano per lo stipendio
6006900 vendere a chi i concorrenti stanno appollaiati su un ramo come avvoltoi aspettano perch spendere soldi per comperare una mela che cadr da sola un giorno o laltro
6006901 ma se tutto fosse andato come volevi tu cosa ci sarebbe di diverso
6006902 ah davvero supponi di essere a capo di una azienda in espansione ogni anno raddoppi il fatturato ti quoti in borsa apri filiali in tutto il mondo e allora pensi di essere libero quando mai hai trovato il tempo per godere i tuoi successi unimpresa un moloch che ti assorbe tutto ti prosciuga fino allultima goccia
6006903 robert le scelte sono libere finch non le fai ma una decisione una volta presa come un muro tu lhai costruito e tu proibisci a te stesso di passare di l
6006904 sei sempre quello di allora piovi qui gonfio del tuo successo di leccaculo internazionale e ridi di me
6006905 non rido affatto e non ho proprio niente di cui essere gonfio
6006906 perch ti ho fatto bere alla mia bottiglia non hai voluto berci allora vuoi sentirti dire che avevi ragione tu ok avevi ragione congratulazioni adesso te ne puoi andare
6006907 me ne sono andato mi sentivo colpevole di non sapere cosaltro avrei potuto fare non lo so neanche adesso
6006908 when you think about how we make decisions for cars and mortgages and how we eliminate options based on cost thats not necessarily the case for college
6006909 at some point if its going to totally put a familys finances in jeopardy rationality needs to factor in
6006910 you must make allowance for each others faults and forgive the person who offends you remember the lord forgave you so you must forgive others
6006911 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6006912 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6006913 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6006914 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6006915 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6006916 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6006917 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6006918 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6006919 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6006920 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

6007031 their extortion campaign demanding that businesses pay protection money to avoid being attacked
6007032 to control cell phone use has quickly evolved into just another extortion campaign
6007033 the cell phone service in order to stay in touch with friends family and the few government services that are available
6007034 demanded that night service be restored it was but then noting that there were several cell phone companies operating in southern afghanistan the taliban went to the different companies and offered not only protection but damage to a competitor for a price

6007047 after five plus years of criticizing amds direct connect architecture our competition has effectively ratified it by developing a technology based on the core fundamentals of our design
6007048 amd is always skating to where the puck will be to borrow a phrase from wayne gretzky nine years ago we saw that efficient processor architecture was what customers needed and we led the industry there now intel is finally arriving to the architecture game late and weve moved on to delivering a truly superior balanced platform with todays leading graphics technologies like the 790gx and the ati radeon hd 4870 x2 and our industry leading processor architectures amd is delivering computing solutions today that are designed for tomorrows graphics intensive workloads while intel is sprinting just to implement technologies like we introduced in 2003 our focus is squarely on execution weve got the strongest products weve ever had and we believe our offerings will only get better in 2h 08
6007049 when considering something like intels larrabee their attempt at entering the graphics market it is important to remember product blunders like itanium and xscale in that context larrabee makes perfect sense as intels proposed graphics solution when all you can do is x86 processors then everything looks like a problem that can be solved by x86 processing cores unfortunately early analysis by industry experts point to larrabee being too hot and too slow to be an effective graphics solution
6007050 amd is on a roll in graphics leadership from the best mainstream hd desktop and notebook chipsets to high performance graphics cards for the most demanding graphics applications today

6007073 there was this view early on in the crisis that sovereign wealth funds could save everybody investment banks did something stupid they lost money in the sub prime theyre great buys
6007074 that view neglects the point that the financial system has become very bloated in size and needed to shrink

6007083 ich bin mir sicher er w rde diese strategische option nicht schn de zur ckweisen aber mir wird st ndig vorgeworfen ich sei machtgierig
6007084 aber nicht um der macht willen sondern weil ich etwas bewegen will
6007085 in hessen waren die mehrheiten schon immer knapp ich bin mir des risikos bewusst
6007086 man guckt den leuten auf die stirn nichts ins hirn

6007090 die mannschaft ist ins tiefste dunkel gest rzt man darf verlieren aber nicht so viele spieler haben am ende den kopf verloren und wild um sich geschlagen
6007091 es ist ein gro er schmerz f r den ich keine erkl rung habe
6007092 nat rlich wird der druck gr er werden und es wird zweifel an mir als trainer geben

6007096 we hope that our installations will bring about a net cooling of the area
6007097 if the meltdown is not stopped we hope that it will at least be slowed down
6007098 they were kind enough to give me a few of the playboy bunny necklace that i wear in the film
6007099 i mean theyre not that expensive but it means a lot
6007100 any allegation that any funding weve given to any project has been misused and not used to change the lives of disadvantaged children and young people makes me concerned and very sad
6007101 we take the trust that the public puts in bbc children in need and the fact that they provide us with their finding extremely seriously and im incredibly concerned
6007102 bushs adamant stand may be peculiar to him but the willingness of republican legislators to line up with him is more significant
6007103 save the children hyperbole being trotted out by the dems this smells of a political scam where it doesnt matter how much bush had agreed to expand the program the dems would have overshot the target just to force the administration to veto and provide them a cheap avenue of rhetorical attack
6007104 theres going to come a point in time where everybodys on the list
6007105 not hesitate to act alone if necessary to exercise our right of self defense by acting pre emptively

6007109 this is an interesting merger in that the new company will be a supplier to all the big mobile companies except mot n
6007110 in a business where scale matters the complementary product portfolios contributed by the parent companies will deliver significant scale and synergies
6007111 here they ericsson are in an instant creating a business with a critical mass and a market leading position within and at the same time focusing on the core operations
6007112 this type of streamlining is of course positive and i dont think we should rule out that we will see more of this
6007113 encourage consumers to dispose of clothes which have only been worn a few times in favour of new cheap garments which themselves will also go out of fashion and be discarded within a matter of months
6007114 this festival is participated by people regardless of their financial status with equal fervour all enjoy to their hearts content
6007115 we the ao tribe used to get together and celebrate this we meet each other and in that way we co operate each other in our work having this kind of festival draws the people close to each other
6007116 inspite of all the trouble taking place i think the people have just pushed themselves forward to get together create a scene of peace and harmony among us
6007117 the opening of the redbridge centre could not have happened at a better time this being londons summer of cycling
6007118 one of my key ambitions as mayor is to see london become a real cycling city by encouraging the estimated 1 1 million londoners who own bikes but dont use them regularly to get back in the saddle
6007119 so now theres no excuse because its a superb facility and if you dont own a bike theyll lend you one just turn up and pedal
6007120 im not going back to london you cant make me ive done my time im a free man
6007121 i want to see anyone who poses a threat to our children dealt with as firmly as possible ive spoken to child protection experts and the police and they have told me that these changes will further restrict the ability of child sex offenders to harm children both here and overseas
6007122 landmarks can be semantic for instance a theatre is a cultural landmark
6007123 there are also visual landmarks with a colour and shape that makes them distinctive and structural landmarks with a strategic position on the edge of a square or at an intersection
6007124 todays police intervention was a sort of act of desperate aid for people who for the past two years have lived in very unusual conditions in a closed environment in seclusion in uncertainty where various forms of thought take shape
6007125 there are 796 of them and if neither mr obama nor mrs clinton emerges from the primary season with the 2 025 delegates necessary to secure the nomination they will in essence serve as tiebreakers that is a result both sides see as increasingly likely known as superdelegates because they are free to cast their votes at the convention as they see fit they are the object of an intensifying and potentially high stakes charm offensive by the candidates and their supporters
6007126 all efforts to find some point in napoleons career at which he turned wrong or went too far is misguided his whole character and career were fundamentally wrong he always went too far
6007127 das ist eine sehr gute idee wenn sie so clean wird und auch blake sehen kann kann es nur gut sein

6007133 alle elemente der rentenreform m ssen wirkungsgleich auf die beamten bertragen werden

6007143 the proposal which will benefit all policyholders to transfer with profits annuity policies to prudential is a further major success arising from the societys ongoing review of strategic options
6007144 the board has been very conscious of the particular difficulties faced by with profits annuitants and we are pleased to have negotiated this excellent proposition for them
6007145 they will become part of an actively managed fund which is one of the largest and strongest in the uk
6007146 work is an important social lifeline and consequently we are seeing a significant number of older people planning to work beyond state pension age either in a paid capacity or in the voluntary sector
6007147 as a generation of savers the over 55s are more likely to have this luxury of choice
6007148 signore ges ti ringrazio per il tuo amore e per essere venuto sulla terra a morire per me riconosco che fino ad oggi sono stato io a dirigere la mia vita e ho peccato contro di te adesso voglio affidarmi a te riceverti nella mia vita grazie per aver perdonato i miei peccati fai di me la persona che desideri che io sia ti ringrazio per aver risposto alla mia pregheria e per la tua presenza nella mia vita ora amen
6007149 i have observed all the local dolphins over a number of years and have watched billie occasionally performing tail walks in the years since her release sometimes in the bow wave of large ships which is an awesome sight
6007150 about five years ago another female dolphin called wave began performing the same behaviour but does so with much greater regularity than billie a third adult female dolphin has also been seen tail walking
6007151 if tail walking is a true cultural behaviour it will gradually spread through the local population probably by being adopted by youngsters
6007152 these are things that groups develop and are passed between individuals and that come to define those groups such as language or dancing and it would seem that among the port river dolphins we may have an incipient tail walking culture
6007153 this behaviour by the adelaide dolphins demonstrates their intelligence and is even more proof that these animals are unsuitable for confinement in captivity where they are unable to express natural behaviour or form normal social groups with other animals
6007154 aqu se juega una parte de la libertad del mundo aqu se libra el combate contra el terrorismo

6007156 ich kenne die melodie und man hat mir den text gegeben den werde ich mir noch ein paar mal genau anschauen
6007157 es steht fest dass ich nicht singen werde ich freue mich auf meinen job als schweizer nationaltrainer das einmal zu sein war ein gro er wunsch von mir weil mich viel mit diesem land verbindet
6007158 ich f hle mich auch als halber schweizer ich war dort 17 jahre trainer habe meine karriere dort begonnen und ich wohne an der grenze von 2004 bis 2007 als ich eine pause eingelegt habe wohnte ich in im schweizer engelberg die emotionale beziehung ist sehr eng es ist auch das gef hl wieder daheim zu sein
6007159 ich werde zwischen engelberg und l rrach pendeln das sind nur 90 minuten wenn sie so wollen ein normales fu ballspiel entfernt
6007160 das ging schnell ich war viele jahre dort und ich hatte einen sehr sch nen abschied
6007161 ein solcher abschied bleibt bis zum lebensende es ist ein gl cksfall wenn dir als trainer so etwas passiert grunds tzlich verl uft bei den bayern kein jahr ger uschlos das geh rt dort dazu
6007162 mein schlaf ist ruhiger das stimmt verantwortung hat man hier auch aber es sind eben zehn zw lf spiele und keine 60 die belastung ist eine andere man hat bessere nerven als klubtrainer kannst du eine niederlage nach drei tagen wieder vergessen machen als nationaltrainer musst du auf die chance manchmal sechs wochen warten
6007163 als klubtrainer hast du sechs wochen vorbereitungszeit vor dem zypernspiel habe ich zwei tage zun chst einmal ist das auch ein abenteuer von dem man zuerst nicht wei wie es funktioniert aber ich hatte einige zeit mich auch darauf vorzubereiten als nationaltrainer hast du eher projekte zu bearbeiten f r die du ganz andere zeitr ume zur verf gung stehen
6007164 die schweiz ist nicht ein so gro es land und qualifikationen f r gro e turniere sind keine selbstverst ndlichkeit wir haben diesmal mit auch griechenland und israel schwere gegner in der wm qualifikation die schweiz war mit k bi kuhn dreimal bei gro en turnieren dabei ich wei was von mir erwartet wird
6007165 ich habe viel vertrauen gesp rt es gibt wohl immer ein paar die auf die unsinnige idee kommen man wolle sich hier nur ausruhen ich denke meine bisherige arbeit spricht f r sich ich gehe auch an diesen job mit gro em ehrgeiz den druck mache ich mir selber dazu brauche ich keine ffentlichkeit
6007166 ich finde die schweiz hat sich gut und selbstbewusst verkauft
6007167 ich werde versuchen meine philosophie zu vermitteln eine gewinnermentalit t die spieler sollen bis zur letzten sekunde daran glauben ein spiel zu drehen
6007168 wenn sie so wollen aber ich nenne es einfach gewinnermentalit t fest steht ich werde neue spieler nominieren um eine neue konkurrenzsituation zu schaffen
6007169 neue ziele sind immer gut der job in der schweiz wird auch f r mein leben eine gro e ver nderung
6007170 was hei t hier schwierigkeiten man muss erst einmal sechs sieben spiele sehen bevor man solche urteile f llt wenn man dort nur knapp gewinnt reicht das nicht man muss immer klar gewinnen
6007171 umgebaut wurde das trainingsgel nde ja von den bayern das hatte glaube ich mit klinsmann wenig zu tun die internen umbauten entsprechen j rgens philosophie ich beobachte die ver nderungen mit gro em interesse
6007172 langsam langsam jetzt fange ich erst einmal an und wie gesagt wir haben viel vor ich freue mich jetzt zuerst einmal auf mein erstes l nderspiel und die zwei tage vorbereitung dann kommen die wm qualifikationsspiele gegen israel und luxemburg
6007173 das darf jeder sehen wie er will wir haben vor jedem gegner respekt
6007174 der krebs hat nicht gestreut sie haben alles wegbekommen und ich werde ganz sicher nicht an brustkrebs sterben

6007186 given these figures it is no surprise that regular pension saving continues to decline
6007187 they have assumed the best case for the isa and worst for the pension and this undermines the research
6007188 in a 1978 article entitled the ethics of terminal care
6007189 these four fundamental features of human worth respect for the individual inclusion in comunity concern for the body and considerations of a broader purpose are offered as ethical guidelines for terminal care
6007190 cleaving to another recognizing that the other is the bone of the bone and the flesh of the flesh that is given in common locating the mutual body as the site of the moral gesture is fundamental to ethical reflection it requires a radical rethinking of all that occurs to the other all of the yearning all of the loss is in fact my loss this responsibility for the narratives great and small for the dreams of the other for the temptations of the other for the responsibility of the other creates a mutual commandedness the encounter is intensely personal the death of the other the illness of the other her vulnerability is your own
6007191 the western culture tends to avoid serious consideration of death and avoidance behavior is readily documented

6007195 mir hat einmal das gesamte unterdeck der linie 77 applaudiert als ich neben dem bus her rannte und w hrend der fahrt aufsprang mit einer aktentasche in der hand
6007196 ich war schon als schuljunge total vernarrt in diese busse und sp ter stolz darauf selbst am steuer zu sitzen
6007197 die alten motoren wurden l ngst ausgetauscht nicht zuletzt um die busse umweltfreundlicher zu machen
6007198 das halbautomatische getriebe mit lenkstockhebel war viel sch ner als die neue automatik mit drucktasten

6007205 respetamos adem s que este prestigioso profesional se niegue a dar el nombre del abogado y a iniciar acciones legales lo importante en todo caso es recordar que actos como estos a n cuando astorga hubiese decidido iniciar acciones legales generalmente quedan impunes por falta de una ley contra la discriminaci n
6007206 en esta semana hemos conocido de brutales casos de discriminaci n a las minor as sexuales y es tiempo ya de que las autoridades comprendan la importancia de aprobar en breve y con urgencia una ley que haga frente a estos atropellos
6007207 esta no es la primera vez que personajes p blicos son asociados a conductas homosexuales sin su consentimiento o se les intenta desacreditar inhumanamente por una orientaci n sexual natural incluso en aquellos casos cuando ni siquiera hay certeza de que ciertas personas sean o gays o lesbianas
6007208 there is a clear underlying trend towards a reduced pension promise for todays workers compared with past generations
6007209 one of the main objectives of pension reforms in oecd countries has been to cut public pension expenditures and make pension systems financially sustainable in the face of population ageing
6007210 perhaps surprisingly there is little evidence of an increased pensions contribution burden in this period
6007211 todays workers will have to do more on their own to prepare for tomorrows retirement
6007212 rocketing household bills over the past few years have put a major strain on the finances of many pensioners yet up to 4

6007228 sinn fein are not interested in ripping down unionists symbols or tearing down the statue of carson we want to create an environment which reflects the nature of the assembly and our society in the 21st century
6007229 this means that we need to bring in more symbols that reflect the nationalist and republican traditions as well as other items from different cultural backgrounds
6007230 the assembly building should not reflect an image of domination of one culture by another
6007231 we need to create a more inclusive environment at stormont for staff elected members and the public
6007232 the institutions are about power sharing and the equal recognition of all traditions
6007233 yet this inventory of the symbols and emblems on display or in storage in the stormont assembly estate highlights the need for an equality shake up
6007234 clearly there is not enough particularly of the grand nature symbolism to reflect either the range of traditions that exists side by side on this island or indeed the new relationships and political dispensation
6007235 i believe that we should take advice from the equality commission who have experience of dealing with these issues at local government
6007236 i also believe there is scope for a sub committee or ad hoc committee to look at how we make progress
6007237 it is a post harvest festival and since there are bountiful crops available we play the game as a mark of celebration the winner of the game will treat the participants with traditional wine it is a festival filled with fun and enjoyment
6007238 we want to show how our forefathers used to play this game they played it during the war and we are just imitating and learning how to throw the spear and learn
6007239 this war game is the significance of the warriors and this is not in the form of competition but still while playing this game people will know who the best player is and who the best runners are

6007252 you are going to see it no matter when we release it and this worked better for us so deal with it
6007253 we dont care about you because we already have your money

6007257 my goals at the start of this year were to make the top 70 in the money list and try and win an event
6007258 it didnt look as though i would get them for while but now if i keep playing the way i am i might have a chance
6007259 hopefully i get to play two maybe three of them this year with these playoffs if you get hot at the right time you could go all the way

6007263 with company contributions at no less than those currently provided
6007264 there can be no doubt that the unions were misled over this issue and that a deliberate attempt was made to delay serious discussion until the sale was complete
6007265 this is completely unacceptable the union acted in good faith throughout the negotiations and the decision may well lead to a dispute with airwave
6007266 during the discussions the union had clearly registered its concerns that members would not know what pension arrangements would be in place in the new company
6007267 it will not pay to save for many of those who need this help most such as those women who can only afford to save a little because they are on low incomes or have broken employment records
6007268 this could damage consumer confidence and put the success of the governments pension reforms at risk
6007269 personal accounts will provide a low cost simple means of saving for retirement and with a mandatory employer contribution will offer good incentives to save
6007270 if you were above the pivotal age advice to contract out was likely to be wrong unless there was a particular reason that outweighed the likely disadvantage
6007271 we think what we are doing today strikes the right balance in targeting it personal accounts and making sure people can make enough contribution
6007272 pleased that the government has listened to our concerns we can live with this
6007273 today is a significant day in the history of pensions and should be recognised as such
6007274 we are particularly pleased to see that ministers have held fast to their rejection of the call made by some employers to introduce a waiting period before new employees could claim an employer contribution
6007275 it has only paid out 4m so far although 125 000 people have been robbed of their pensions
6007276 the government said it had put in place laws which would make employer pension schemes completely safe and ensure that the employer had put enough money in to fund the pensions

6007280 pending an international mechanism in south ossetia russian peacekeeping forces will implement additional security measures

6007284 piri is an outstanding rugby player and to have him play in new zealand is fantastic for us
6007285 he has represented new zealand at the highest level and he has been an influential player for his province and franchise as well
6007286 we are delighted that rugby will continue to benefit from his talent and experience
6007287 piri has a major role to play with both the hurricanes and the vodafone wellington lions
6007288 at the age of just 24 he has already earned an astonishing 56 caps for the hurricanes 41 for the vodafone wellington lions and 22 for the all blacks with plenty more to come
6007289 i cant say anything concrete since i dont really know myself the situation
6007290 everything is still being discussed maybe spartak have already made a decision but i havent decided one way or the other
6007291 moreover the transfer to england which everyone is talking about would be a big problem for my family as we have a young child so we need to discuss it properly
6007292 i dont know because i have never been at a foreign club you need to try something first in order to know
6007293 on the one hand its easier as a pair but on the other alone the situation forces you to get used to new conditions quicker both language and life
6007294 everything will depend on what kind of offer will be made to the club and to me my move to a top club definitely would reflect well on the image of spartak
6007295 in this particular instance weve not been able to uncover the source of the infection or any break in practice or procedure
6007296 because its unusual to have both events in a short amount of time we feel the need to do the review

6007300 some insurance company sipps can operate by paying a quite substantial commission upfront which is deducted from the customers investment fund
6007301 but this is generally done by agreement between the customer and the adviser
6007302 advice given to transfer into a sipp is suitable reflects the customers needs priorities and circumstances and is not influenced by commission payments
6007303 think long and hard about it and look at other forms of savings besides pension schemes
6007304 it does get to me i have to say im not saying im angry about it every day but when i start to think about it i have to stop
6007305 by this time id hopefully have been going on a couple of holidays a year im not saying big holidays but a weekend here and maybe a week somewhere else its just sort of week to week now really
6007306 when richardsons first closed down the first thing was id applied for early retirement to get early retirement you had to be over 60 and i had just turned 60
6007307 so i thought ill still try and get early retirement then i was told that when a firm goes into liquidation the pension scheme is frozen and there is no early retirement so that was the first blow
6007308 then eventually we were told that when the pension scheme was wound up the money to wind it up had come from the scheme itself so in those circumstances we were told we would be lucky to get 25 of our pensions
6007309 first of all i said ive five years to try and survive until my pension comes but then i said what do i do now i havent even a pension to look forward to i tried to apply for jobs i dont know how many i applied for but ive no qualifications
6007310 those 27 years in richardsons were specialised work if you like and theres no other similar factory i could have worked in
6007311 im still not sure how much im getting id of course like 100 of it but weve been told we should get about 80 which will equate to about 125 each week

6007315 i know valencia because weve done several tests here last winter but now were racing in the city on a new track im sure it will be a great atmosphere
6007316 ive seen the new track only from the position of an on board camera and it seems to be very fast for a street circuit i always love to drive on new tracks and i am always very quick to know them i cant wait to race at valencia
6007317 i hope ill have a trouble free weekend to try to set up the car the best way possible especially for the qualifying lap the qualifying will be extremely important although i think that there are some possibilities on the track to overtake

6007319 there were some races where things didnt go well but for one reason or the other i was able to collect some precious points

6007327 i had no idea it would be on the world stage
6007328 she had a phenomenal work ethic whatever the task may be she worked like crazy

6007341 what about my own contract situation i am just happy playing my football but if anything like that comes about ill be delighted
6007342 ive got this season and two more years left im happy really happy with how things are going happy here at aston villa

6007347 we are here to safeguard the savings of the 12 million people who are members of eligible defined benefit occupational pension schemes
6007348 the payments we will now make show we are doing just that and those affected can be reassured that their income every month comes from a known trusted and stable source
6007349 we had no idea that things were going so wrong with the company and it was a big worry when it all collapsed
6007350 at that stage we did not know whether i would get my pension or not
6007351 to have invested in my pension for 26 and lost it all would have been a huge blow
6007352 it sends out an important message of reassurance to more than 100 000 scheme members currently in assessment and to scheme members set to come through our doors in the future that they can look forward to security in retirement

6007359 i feel like its better not for us to dwell on that type of thing it could only go wrong
6007360 weve all been playing in bands for a very long time with little or no success depending on how you define that but the fact is that we went into this with only one ambition to have a good time and for us being able to still do that is really all thats important
6007361 we do like the thought of trying to be the best band in america
6007362 i mean who really knows who the best band is i dont thats for sure so for us striving to be really good at what we do and trying to have a good time thats the fun part everything else is just a little beyond us
6007363 on a good night we move more alcohol than most bands do in a week
6007364 when we first started out our audiences were maybe a little reflection of us you know people in their later 20s early 30s and predominately dudes guys who buy records and watch sports and a smattering of angry girlfriends
6007365 i think as the bands audience has grown weve actually expanded younger and there are a lot more girls coming to the shows and a lot of girls making their presence more upfront and thats just amazing
6007366 one of the coolest things i see now is fathers and sons coming to the show together
6007367 were kind of a classic rock band and people who grew up in the 70s and 80s even can probably relate to us as much as a 21 year old kid now theres also a really interesting sense of community with the fans theres a particular group called the unified scene who wear matching t shirts and form these bonds through the shows and i never thought wed see that
6007368 its really exciting to think about where this band has been and where were going
6007369 when we started we wanted to play a show and drink some beer and then last summer we opened for the rolling stones and played glastonbury and we opened for the stooges in croatia this band has really taken us around the world and its allowed all of us to see so much im pretty much amazed on a daily basis

6007399 der hat gesagt wenn wir jemand bringen der mehr zahlt als die t rken dann verkauft er das haus an denjenigen
6007400 es ist nicht richtig dass hier t rken eine moschee errichten es sind sterreichische staatsb rger die das haus kaufen wollen es gibt bereits einen vorvertrag mit einem t rkischen kulturverein es wird auch nichts umgebaut sondern der verein will im keller einen gebetsraum machen in die wohnung im ersten stock soll eine familie einziehen das sind sehr angenehme leute die momentan in der stadt sind aber deren mietvertrag dort ausl uft

6007413 hes made the england selectors notice him and to make the initial squad for the champions trophy was a fantastic effort
6007414 the goal was to get him through to the end of the season and we almost got there but if you had asked me at the start of the season id have settled for what weve had from simon during the past four months

6007422 there was a question mark last year about apple that maybe it had taken its eye off the ball by concentrating on the iphone but now the iphone and ipod and mac are nicely aligned
6007423 most of apples windows based competition is suffering a bit from vista
6007424 complaints about vista are generating complaints about the computer makers
6007425 people know there have been some service and product quality problems but apple has an almost teflon like quality its problems dont really seem to matter to consumers
6007426 most lose it slowly like dell has which took a while and we see companies improve but apples extreme volatility is almost like its stock price
6007427 apple will be very difficult to catch but i dont think that these results where theres a 10 point difference will hold
6007428 my guess is that they will regroup at some point and come back

6007450 theres been lots of speculation every day and weve been linked with hundreds of players and i dont think well be signing all of them
6007451 ive no comment to make on speculation if we sign any decent players well release a statement but theres no point me talking about players who might or might not be coming to the football club
6007452 weve made good progress over the last day or two and i hope we have some news over the next 48 hours
6007453 its out of my hands weve made some great offers for players and good deals with clubs im quite relaxed about it
6007454 if players want to come and we can take them to another level fantastic but if they want to stay at the clubs theyre at good luck to them its not a major problem
6007455 im not really looking to let any players go but if an offer comes in for one or two of my players like every other manager ive got to balance the books
6007456 ive brought lots of players in and if i feel theres an offer that we think is a good offer obviously id consider it
6007457 this study will potentially demonstrate that it is the regimen of administration of birth control pills rather than their specific formulation that results in successful treatment of pmdd
6007458 if we can eliminate the hormone cycling we should eliminate the pmdd symptoms
6007459 theyre regulators of mood and emotion so if you can eliminate the metabolites that have been implicated in pmdd you may create a huge benefit for women with pmdd
6007460 we believe this trial will help us understand the underlying physiology which will allow for the development of a range of possible new treatments
6007461 id gain weight my face would be puffy i had horrible cramps and that would get me mentally down the symptoms changed as i matured and had children it gradually became more emotional now it also affects my mental acuity and i can still get down sometimes
6007462 the impairment and reduction in quality of life for women with pmdd during their premenstrual phase is equivalent to people with major depression anxiety disorder and even post traumatic stress disorder
6007463 if we can show that continuous low dose contraceptives are effective that opens up another option that may have a better risk benefit profile than ssris
6007464 many women in our previous studies felt better knowing they were contributing to furthering our knowledge about this disorder and informing subsequent treatment options
6007465 we can give them a gold standard diagnosis if they do have pmdd and if they have something else we can help them find treatment for it
6007466 i know what to do and where to go i have all the information and i know help is there theres such a peace of mind from that
6007467 the more we understand the better we can treat it and the better for everyone
6007468 there is so much lost productivity in women with pmdd just think how much more a woman could accomplish if she didnt have to lose so much of herself and her energy every month
6007469 moms conventional wisdom of eating fruits and vegetables to lead a healthy life has evolved into more scientific fact finding research during the last four decades due to advances in science
6007470 studies are showing the importance of fruits vegetables and nuts in reducing the risk of cancer and cardiovascular diseases
6007471 it is befitting that the society is focusing more on health and preventing diseases
6007472 while we continue to consume various healthy foods several challenges of toxicity bioavailability of certain bioactive compounds and food drug interactions are yet to be understood
6007473 this technique is really the first time that cancer surgeons can see structures that are otherwise invisible providing true image guided surgery

6007482 we dont pass on the entire burden onto the consumers every time the atf prices go up so it is highly unlikely that we will reduce the airfares this month but it also depends on the quantum of atf price reduction
6007483 national multi commodity exchange nmce had proposed to appoint bandhoypadhyay on behalf of fmc as an alternate director but the proposal has been rejected on technical grounds

6007507 todays event would not have been possible without the strong support of the german chancellor her excellency angela merkel and her government
6007508 from the time i discussed the issue of the partnership with her in june 2007 up till this moment she has remained steadfast in the pursuit of its actualisation
6007509 it is evident that the original objective of the partnership which is to address nigerias energy challenge while guaranteeing germany short and long term energy security has been properly addressed
6007510 while assuring you of the readiness of all relevant federal government functionaries not only to buy into but also to provide the requisite impetus for the process i wish to congratulate all who have contributed to evolving this partnership for a job well done

6007539 men who underwent tonsillectomy alone bled significantly more than women 11 2 percent and 5 4 percent respectively
6007540 further investigation of this relationship is needed with stratification of patients by the number of cigarettes smoked and attention to the length of time before and or after surgery that patients refrain from smoking
6007541 severe diabetes mellitus is more likely to be associated with chronic hyperglycemia high blood glucose which in turn increases the likelihood of cerebral microvascular disease and may contribute to neuronal damage brain atrophy and cognitive impairment
6007542 our findings suggest that diabetes mellitus duration and severity as measured by type of treatment and the presence of diabetes mellitus complications may be important in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment in subjects with diabetes mellitus
6007543 in contrast late onset of diabetes mellitus short duration of diabetes mellitus or well controlled diabetes mellitus may have a lesser effect
6007544 its getting harder and harder to believe that these cells are immunoprivileged
6007545 in fact the rejection of these cells confirms our suspicions that they do cause an immune response
6007546 we all want to know whats going to happen if you transplant these stem cells into a person
6007547 based on these results we believe that transplanting these cells into humans would also cause an immune response
6007548 thats the beauty of this kind of noninvasive imaging system
6007549 it allows us to assess the response of one animal to a variety of conditions and gives us much more valuable information
6007550 a lot of research efforts are devoted to the basic science of stem cells
6007551 this work is focused on the immediate practicalities of actually using these cells therapeutically
6007552 this study will potentially demonstrate that it is the regimen of administration of birth control pills rather than their specific formulation that results in successful treatment of pmdd
6007553 if we can eliminate the hormone cycling we should eliminate the pmdd symptoms
6007554 theyre regulators of mood and emotion so if you can eliminate the metabolites that have been implicated in pmdd you may create a huge benefit for women with pmdd

6007568 basic travel records can quite literally help frontline officers to connect the dots
6007569 our study underscores the high rate of poor quality and inadequate sleep in adolescence coupled with the risk of developing high blood pressure and other health problems
6007570 we also found that a low sleep efficiency may be more consistently associated with pre hypertension than a shorter sleep period
6007571 although the overall frequency of sleep insufficiency in children is unknown our studys prevalence of 26 percent may be under estimated due to the exclusion of children with known sleep disorders and other illnesses
6007572 part of the problem is the technological invasion of the bedroom with computers cell phones and music
6007573 there are teens who text message or listen to music all night compounded by early school hours adolescents need nine hours of sleep parents should optimize sleep quality for their family with regular sleep and wake times and bedrooms should be kept quiet dark and conducive to sleep
6007574 these groups already are known to be at higher risk for hypertension and other adverse outcomes
6007575 their high prevalence of poor sleep quality and deprivation could be due to disruptive home environments and neighborhoods as well as unrecognized psychological and medical problems
6007576 meanwhile pediatricians should view sleep quality and patterns as an intervenable health concern
6007577 our data underscores the need to monitor quality and quantity of sleep as part of a childs overall health strategy
6007578 this is the first study to comprehensively look at a large population of infected persons to study the long term effects of west nile virus
6007579 we found that both physical and mental functions as well as mood and fatigue seemed to return to normal in about one year
6007580 this discovery may eventually lead to enhanced understanding of psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia obsessive compulsive disorder and attention deficit disorder all conditions in which a persons ability to remember and change such rules is impaired
6007581 this indicates that different parts of our brains store different kinds of memories and information
6007582 provides clues about how the human brain accomplishes complex goal directed behaviors that require remembering and changing abstract rules an ability that is disrupted in many mental illnesses
6007583 and we were awakened to the fact that infectious diseases like tuberculosis really had never left

6007591 given the ability of rhodactis sp to rapidly reproduce and completely smother reefs managers are now facing the possibility that even with removal of the ship sheer reproductive capacity of r howesii may continue to fuel its spread along the western reef shelf of palmyra
6007592 carl woese and his colleagues years ago established that protein translation had to be well developed when the evolution of modern cells started
6007593 so the evolution of cells and the evolution of translation are really linked to one another
6007594 to be a molecular signature a sequence has to be common to all members of a single domain of life but not another
6007595 until the 2000s when these structures became available you werent able to correlate where these signatures were with what was touching them in 3 d space
6007596 so nobody had ever done this sort of analysis before
6007597 the ramifications of this work are it gives you a much better way to probe how this universal machinery changes from one organism to another
6007598 in that the ribosome constitutes the core of the cellular translation mechanism which is the sine qua non of gene expression which is the essence of life as we know it these findings constitute a major step in understanding the evolution of life which is still a journey of a thousand miles
6007599 we found that mosquitoes can smell deet and they stay away from it
6007600 deet doesnt mask the smell of the host or jam the insects senses mosquitoes dont like it because it smells bad to them
6007601 for decades we were told that deet warded off mosquito bites because it blocked insect response to lactic acid from the host the key stimulus for blood feeding
6007602 dr leal and co workers escaped the key stimulus over simplification to show that mosquito responses like our own result from a balancing of various positive and negative factors all impinging on a tiny brain more capable than most people think of sophisticated decision making
6007603 one of the great attributes of science is that over time it is self correcting
6007604 i was so delighted when i first encountered the neuron that detects deet a synthetic compound
6007605 i couldnt believe my eyes because it goes against conventional wisdom so i repeated the experiment over and over until we discussed the findings in the lab
6007606 despite the fact that deet is the industry standard mosquito repellent relatively little is known about how it actually works
6007607 previous studies have suggested a masking or binding with host emanations understanding the mode of action is especially important because deet is used as the standard against which all other tentative replacement repellents are compared
6007608 in the future this new knowledge can be incorporated into developing new repellents and may be in control strategies for culex quinquefasciatus and other mosquitoes
6007609 presents as a very logical basis to help us understand how deet is perceived by the mosquitoes and this work provides an excellent explanation to link physiological processing within the mosquito to the macroscopic behavioral response that we observe in laboratory bioassays with this repellent
6007610 we always believed mobile would take off to the mainstream that there would be eventually be more robust devices better discovery and improved access

6007619 in a series of eye movement studies we showed that social experience has an impact on how people look at faces specifically we noticed a striking difference in eye movements in westerners and east asian observers we found that westerners tend to look at specific features on an individuals face such as the eyes and mouth whereas east asian observers tend to focus on the nose or the centre of the face which allows a more general view of all the features one possible cause of this could be that direct or excessive eye contact may be considered rude in east asian cultures
6007620 by disproving the long held assumption that face processing is universally achieved we have highlighted that the external environment including the society in which we develop is very influential in basic human mechanisms and caution should be taken when generalizing findings to the entire human population
6007621 to evaluate the effects of homocysteine lowering treatment with folic acid plus vitamin b12 on mortality and cardiovascular events
6007622 mean average plasma total homocysteine concentration was reduced by 30 percent after 1 year of treatment in the groups receiving folic acid and vitamin b12
6007623 during a median midpoint 38 months of follow up the primary end point was experienced by a total of 422 participants 13 7 percent 219 participants 14 2 percent receiving folic acid vitamin b12 vs 203 13 1 percent not receiving such treatment and 200 participants 13 0 percent receiving vitamin b6 vs 222 14 3 percent not receiving vitamin b6
6007624 we could not detect any preventive effect of intervention with folic acid plus vitamin b12 or with vitamin b6 on mortality or major cardiovascular events among patients with stable coronary artery disease undergoing intensive conventional treatment we found a numerically lower incidence of stroke and higher incidence of cancer in the groups receiving folic acid but these observations were not statistically significant
6007625 our findings do not support the use of b vitamins as secondary prevention in patients with coronary artery disease
6007626 prevention strategies often focus on modifiable risk factors for colonization and aspiration and can successfully reduce ventilator associated pneumonia rates but no single strategy completely eliminates ventilator associated pneumonia
6007627 adherence to prevention guidelines is variable due to costs and lack of education resources and leadership
6007628 the results of this large randomized multicenter study demonstrated that the silver coated endotracheal tube significantly reduced the incidence of microbiologically confirmed ventilator associated pneumonia and had its greatest benefit during the peak time of ventilator associated pneumonia occurrence without any notable adverse events
6007629 the silver coated endotracheal tube appears to offer a unique approach because it is the first intervention that becomes user dependent after intubation requiring no further action by the clinician
6007630 based on the results of this trial should clinicians reconsider guidelines for ventilator associated pneumonia prevention and use a silver coated endotracheal tube in all patients requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation in the icu
6007631 the answer is probably yes for the subset of patients at very high risk of developing early onset ventilator associated pneumonia such as neurologically impaired patients or trauma patients because the greatest effect of the intervention appeared to occur during the first 10 days of mechanical ventilation and was clinically relevant with minimal effect on clinician workload
6007632 important uncertainties exist regarding the exact benefit of silver coated endotracheal tubes
6007633 consequently silver coated tubes should not be viewed as the definitive answer for ventilator associated pneumonia prevention and until additional data confirm the clinical effectiveness and cost benefit of these devices their issue should be restricted to high risk patients treated in icus with benchmark value based infection rates that remain above institutional goals despite implementation of a comprehensive strategy of usual preventive measures to prevent ventilator associated pneumonia
6007634 developing strategies to improve the prediction and diagnoses of dementia has paramount therapeutic and public health implications
6007635 when neuropsychological tests are used for diagnostic purposes an individuals level of performance on specific tests is measured against healthy normative samples to determine cognitive impairment however this approach does not take into account intra individual variability in cognitive function
6007636 there were 61 cases of incident dementia 6 8 percent identified during the follow up period mean average 3 3 years
6007637 on the basis of the consensus clinical diagnostic procedures 47 participants developed incident dementia of the alzheimer type and 18 participants developed incident vascular dementia during the study 128 individuals died as expected for the age of this cohort of these 18 had developed incident dementia
6007638 in summary within person across neuropsychological test variability was associated with development of dementia independently of performance of the neuropsychological tests this finding needs to be replicated in different populations before it is applied in a clinical setting
6007639 postoperative ileus inability of the intestines to pass contents is regarded as an inevitable response to the trauma of abdominal surgery and is a major contributing factor to postoperative pain and discomfort associated with abdominal distension nausea vomiting and cramping pain
6007640 postoperative length of hospital stay was assessed in four trials comprising 134 patients
6007641 this was also reduced in the chewing gum group by longer than one day however this result was not statistically significant
6007642 we feel that the current evidence suggests that gum chewing following abdominal surgery offers significant benefits in reducing the time to resolution of ileus however the studies are insufficiently powered to identify a significant benefit in length of stay
6007643 the potential benefits to individual patients in health economics terms are such that a well designed large scale blinded randomized controlled trial with a placebo arm is warranted to answer the question of whether gum chewing can significantly reduce the length of stay after abdominal surgery or whether it merely represents a placebo effect

6007645 the potential role of arsenic in diabetes development is supported by experimental and mechanistic evidence
6007646 from a public health perspective confirmation of a role for arsenic in diabetes development would add to the concerns posed by the carcinogenic cardiovascular developmental and reproductive effects of inorganic arsenic in drinking water and could substantially modify risk assessment and risk benefit analyses estimating the consequences of arsenic exposure
6007647 given widespread exposure to inorganic arsenic from drinking water worldwide elucidating the contribution of arsenic to the diabetes epidemic is a public health research priority with potential implications for the prevention and control of diabetes
6007648 stemming the pandemic of type 2 diabetes is a public health priority and will require a multifaceted approach this must include improving the understanding of the etiology of diabetes and identifying modifiable factors that can be incorporated into prevention strategies
6007649 to date this approach has focused on medication and lifestyle modification but the role of environmental exposures must also be considered
6007650 while many questions remain about the role of arsenic in diabetogenesis they can only be answered by additional research
6007651 in the meantime arsenic exposure from drinking water is a widespread environmental pollutant that affects millions of individuals around the world it is prudent to minimize arsenic exposure while its effect on metabolic diseases continues to be researched

6007669 fresh water is crucial to human survival and well being yet in poor countries more than a billion people have no access to safe water supplies and more than 2 billion lack basic sanitation facilities

6007671 here in california we are facing one of our worse droughts in two decades this is an immediate reminder about our vulnerability to business as usual in the west and its apparent the era of cheap water and wasteful practices is closing

6007673 what the freshwater initiative allows us to do is to pull people together in new ways to work on critical problems associated with fresh water
6007674 a common theme among the planning grants is the gathering of multidisciplinary expertise within and beyond stanford to encourage wide ranging thinking about water problems and the development of research agendas targeting specific solutions
6007675 these grants will facilitate the formation of new partnerships among people inside and outside of stanford partnerships that are needed to deal with the complexity of the issues associated with fresh water

6007678 there are times when you want to allow non compete clauses and times that you want to allow labor mobility
6007679 now we have a structure to evaluate the two forces involved
6007680 look we have a very successful market amp environment that doesnt restrict innovation as long as ndas non disclosure agreements and nsas non solicitation agreements are maintained its called california and it works very well california entrepreneurs have more rights than those in ma wa and other states is that fair is that healthy
6007681 how is locking up employees better for the market as a whole and how is it better for the ecosystem
6007682 startups challenge big companies which creates competition competition creates new ideas new markets new technologies and innovation without competition we dont have an open market

6007687 having so many offensive weapons really helps if one or two guys are struggling we all have confidence that someone else will pick up the slack
6007688 he is an intelligent consistent player that rarely gives up any soft goals
6007689 no one is untouchable the fact someone is captain does not make him undroppable
6007690 felipe has learnt a lot about terry in the last few weeks
6007691 he knows how much the england captaincy means to him thats why he spoke with capello
6007692 anyone would want a player of steve finnans calibre in their team
6007693 its great to have him back in the squad hes a top defender hes great going forward comfortable on the ball and has lots of experience

6007702 laat alstublieft het project nog anderhalf tot twee jaar doorgaan er is nog zoveel te leren
6007703 het is moeilijk ik zou willen zeggen dat we het door laten gaan maar dat kan ik niet in mijn eentje beslissen dat is in de eerste plaats aan de bengalese overheid zelf
6007704 het is sociaal cultureel niet acceptabel dat vrouwen buiten de deur gaan werken dat was het althans
6007705 als je kijkt wat ik nu doe dan is dat exact wat ik toen al voor ogen had
6007706 ik besloot dat ik met onze milieukennis wilde helpen voorkomen dat ze in ontwikkelingslanden dezelfde milieuschade aanrichten als wij vroeger in de ontwikkelde landen
6007707 toen zag ik hoe het werk op een ambassade eraan toe ging dat beviel me enorm na een jaar heb ik gesolliciteerd bij buitenlandse zaken en ben ik officieel in dienst gekomen in 2002
6007708 mijn vriend geeft heel veel op voor de mogelijkheid om hier samen te zijn
6007709 ik ben hier nu vier keer geweest en toen heb ik het wilhelmus gezongen nu wil ik wel eens weten of jullie het al kennen
6007710 hm ik zie dat het er nog niet helemaal in zit bij jullie
6007711 we hadden een hele slechte beurt gemaakt als we het niet hadden gedaan
6007712 when im president there will be a whole lot more like this not only here in the gulf but also off of our east and west coasts
6007713 we need to drill offshore we need to do it now if i were president i would call the members of congress back into session and tell them get back to work
6007714 opposes new drilling he said it wont solve our problem and that its quote not real hes wrong and the american people know it
6007715 like everybody else we are trying to see if we can sign people but the hardest thing at the moment is to get somebody to say yes
6007716 im hopeful one or two of the injured will be back in contention for sundays game at manchester city and so well see but weve got two weeks left before the window shuts and it will probably go right to the end for us
6007717 ive been in that position where youve not win it
6007718 youre hungry and determined and you want to win it simple as that
6007719 weve got to match their determination their hunger and their desire weve got players at the club whove tasted success over the last couple of years and want more
6007720 were all disappointed we didnt win as every team wants to get off to a winning start but we did okay
6007721 obviously carlos tevez was not there on sunday which was disappointing and wayne rooney missed a bit of pre season
6007722 the future of joaquin is to be at valencia as he is a valencia player and has a contract with the club
6007723 but if an offer arrives that the club is interested in joaquin will have to listen and also vice versa
6007724 however he came to valencia with a wage ceiling and a big dream which continues and hopefully he still has the fans affection
6007725 people have been unjust with joaquin he is not only interested in money because if he was he would now be in england or italy
6007726 everyone forgets ryan is still a young lad thats why he went to the olympics and if he adapts to the premier league i think he can be one of the best players in it
6007727 he is very excited he has always dreamed of playing in europe for a major club
6007728 nathan is an exciting player with a lot of potential he can take defenders on and is good on the ball he can score goals he has featured for the reserves in pre season and has done well
6007729 when he plays for the under 18 team he needs to be the best player every week and he knows that he has still got a lot to learn about the game but he is hungry and he wants to do well
6007730 wir wollen szenen aus dem kolosseum wiederbeleben aus dem alten rom mit gladiatoren und julius caesar
6007731 when people are hurting they need biblical answers not platitudes here the editors and authors have thoroughly combed the scriptures to give us the answers we need in tough times this book should help both those who are suffering and those called upon to comfort and encourage others in their suffering
6007732 the skeptic chides if god is good he is not god if god is god he is not good with scripture to answer the pain of real life questions and with real life pain to question scripture these theologians address the hardest questions with honesty tenderness and deep truth
6007733 those who read this book will thank the gifted team of authors for their careful biblical theological philosophical and ethical engagement with the problem of suffering and evil this timely book addresses these crucial and challenging issues with clarity conviction and pastoral sensitivity readers will be strengthened edified and encouraged i highly recommend this most important book
6007734 morgan and peterson have assembled a fine community of biblical scholars and theologians all committed to christ and the church to address the problem of suffering there are no easy answers to this problem but there are plenty of wrong answers misunderstandings and confusion this book this community will point you in the right direction
6007735 this volume should be warmly embraced by readers anxious to receive realistic good news from the bible on this perennially important subject the writers are biblical pastoral reflective and honest i am grateful for their helpful and theologically rich analysis
6007736 chapter by chapter the authors root and ground their reflections in scripture modeling how to move from biblical exposition to a biblical theology the reflections are not only theoretical and necessary but also practically engaging there is much wisdom in this work and it is my prayer that it will become must reading for every serious christian who wants to learn afresh how to handle gods word rightly for todays church and to proclaim the gospel powerfully to todays world
6007737 the problem of evil is probably the most difficult problem in all of theology and for many atheists it is the achilles heel of the theistic worldview
6007738 deale was previously with aston villa and we had to fight off a lot of clubs to bring him here thankfully he chose the right club in liverpool our goalkeeping coach billy stewart rates him very highly so hopefully he can do well for us this season
6007739 if i could go and buy a good right winger now i would do if i had the money i would buy shaun wright phillips but thats out of the question now i havent got that sort of money
6007740 so ill try to go and find someone like kanu

6007752 i always speak with my staff and ask different questions
6007753 i had a chat with stuart pearce and ray clemence because i prefer to see both sides of everything but the last decision is mine always
6007754 i could only choose once i knew all the players so it was very important to let people try
6007755 one player might be good another might be not so good i had to look for myself
6007756 you hear little whispers and given the form rio has been in and what manchester united have achieved i did think he would get it
6007757 it was a bit nerve wracking and i was actually standing next to rio when fabio told us all after training

6007761 ill sit here and say we have to qualify for the world cup and nothing more simple as that
6007762 ive personally learned a few things from the last campaign and ill not be talking about winning the world cup or anything like that
6007763 lets forget all that stuff lets concentrate on qualifying for the world cup in two years time it is in the hands of the players to do that
6007764 weve got the manager and the players to move forward but lets not focus on winning anything we just need to qualify for this world cup and have to concentrate on that
6007765 in the short of space of time weve had with the manager he has stressed about having less anxiety and more confidence and weve done that

6007767 what government should be focused on is raising the incomes and the aspirations and the opportunities for the millions of people who are stuck on low incomes and that is where this government has failed not because they are bad people not because they dont have noble ambitions but because their measure which is entirely reliant on the state which is about redistribution has failed failed on their own terms
6007768 our education system is failing to spread opportunity our welfare system is keeping people out of work our tax system makes it extremely difficult for those on low incomes to get off those low incomes because those marginal tax rates are so high
6007769 labour has failed it has created a more unfair society and i think there is a real opportunity for the conservative party now to lead this debate

6007828 i have observed all the local dolphins over a number of years and have watched billie occasionally performing tail walks in the years since her release sometimes in the bow wave of large ships which is an awesome sight
6007829 about five years ago another female dolphin called wave began performing the same behaviour but does so with much greater regularity than billie a third adult female dolphin has also been seen tail walking
6007830 if tail walking is a true cultural behaviour it will gradually spread through the local population probably by being adopted by youngsters
6007831 these are things that groups develop and are passed between individuals and that come to define those groups such as language or dancing and it would seem that among the port river dolphins we may have an incipient tail walking culture

6007837 thats great a burning club how can we do that
6007838 would there be a leg back and a leg forward

6007840 we dont have good turns on the yeti his shape has always free floated a bit

6007843 once you forward me the approved front and side technical drawings we can get our sculptor going hell take 2 3 weeks depending on revisions
6007844 we should get started with the packaging early i know im always fancying up shit but i really like a nice package maybe we do something where we play with ice and have him captured in it ya know
6007845 well lets get moving on the drawing right away youll talk to ridd
6007846 this is a shaft of very bright light that cuts through any economic gloom
6007847 that both broadcast and online tv platforms are growing simultaneously underlines how they fulfil different needs for viewers and that they can co exist and indeed promote each other
6007848 first of all in terms of the amount of money spent by advertisers on catch up tv it is so small that it doesnt divert from broadcast tv money the other reason is that in terms of the time spent using online tv services it is actually very small
6007849 there is an apparent paradox or dilemma around how audiences can be up and ad revenues down but one reason that explains it is because demand for tv advertising is flat
6007850 this means there has been an increase in the supply of ads in the market and that means prices dropping you could say that eyeballs have never been cheaper in the last twenty years
6007851 clients are looking at cutting costs not expanding in this market
6007852 so it is actually not that great news that commercial impacts are up as this means that prices are down
6007853 this is an interesting merger in that the new company will be a supplier to all the big mobile companies except motorola nyse news
6007854 in a business where scale matters the complementary product portfolios contributed by the parent companies will deliver significant scale and synergies
6007855 here they ericsson are in an instant creating a business with a critical mass and a market leading position within mobile platforms and at the same time focusing on the core operations
6007856 this type of streamlining is of course positive and i dont think we should rule out that we will see more of this

6007886 we have always said funding towards the 2012 games would be a combination of lottery public and private funding
6007887 to give a guarantee for the full four years would be to say we are not going to have any private funding success i am absolutely confident we will there is no panic and there is no downgrading of our aspirations for 2012 we all have a vested interest in having the strongest team in london

6008089 now we havent heard back and i think the prime ministers department is yet to wake up to the powers of the senate
6008090 it would be better for the government to have responded long ago to the greens request and to have come up with a proposal
6008091 its 12 years since labor was in office and many of the ministers are not practised with making informative approaches to the senate
6008092 but we do have a mandate of our own as well
6008093 the selectors are comfortable this move will maintain the competitive edge for the australian side and provide a wonderful opportunity for brett geeves to join the australian group for the first time

6008099 chaput is one of the most respected leaders of the catholic church in america
6008100 his record is a strong commitment to social and economic justice and the principles of the catholic faith hes also a strong patriot
6008101 pro life democrats who are proud catholics like myself feel this is an insult to our values the party should be aware there are strong pro life people who are politically successful
6008102 im happy to see they are having prayer at their sessions and they have a right to choose whom they want to do that
6008103 hopefully they will know being catholic is more foundational to their identity than anything else
6008104 render unto caesar serving the nation by living our catholic beliefs in political life
6008105 to convince people they should not be embarrassed at being catholic and not buy the supposedly american notion that people should shelve their faith when they enter the public square
6008106 i am tired of people telling religious folks to be quiet in the public square because of constitutional questions of separation of church and state
6008107 i hope this encourages people to become confident and active

6008109 the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out at dawn to hire laborers for his vineyard after agreeing with them for the usual daily wage he sent them into his vineyard going out about nine o clock he saw others standing idle in the marketplace and he said to them you too go into my vineyard and i will give you what is just so they went off and he went out again around noon and around three o clock and did likewise going out about five o clock he found others standing around and said to them why do you stand here idle all day they answered because no one has hired us he said to them you too go into my vineyard when it was evening the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman summon the laborers and give them their pay beginning with the last and ending with the first when those who had started about five o clock came each received the usual daily wage so when the first came they thought that they would receive more but each of them also got the usual wage and on receiving it they grumbled against the landowner saying these last ones worked only one hour and you have made them equal to us who bore the day s burden and the heat he said to one of them in reply my friend i am not cheating you did you not agree with me for the usual daily wage take what is yours and go what if i wish to give this last one the same as you or am i not free to do as i wish with my own money are you envious because i am generous thus the last will be first and the first will be last

6008270 as a hosted it services provider cobweb works hard to keep our environmental impact to a minimum we also help our customers to reduce their own environmental footprint by reducing the need to maintain energy hungry servers on their premises
6008271 we were extremely pleased to receive our iso 14001 accreditation but we do not intend to rest on our laurels we will continue to look at reducing our own carbon footprint and encouraging our customers to join us in a variety of green community initiatives

6008276 sms provides an easy to use mobile solution that doesnt require long wait times or interactive voice response systems to better serve mobile customers and save money organizations with call centers should take advantage of text messaging

6008283 database archiving often fails to get the attention it needs compared to other critical activities related to production databases and data warehouses
6008284 an archival system becomes critical when you need to access archived information in response to a legal summons customer service issue security investigation or technical issue the value of archiving grows considerably as it becomes easier to access the archived data
6008285 with legal demands for access growing conventional approaches to database archiving are increasingly being found lacking they focus on lifting and shifting inactive data from production databases to improve application performance without considering how to optimize the way archived data is stored get your archiving right and you reduce storage costs and guarantee simple future proofed access get it wrong and at worst you could face prison
6008286 why database archiving should be part of your dbms strategy
6008287 it managers need to achieve a balance between the compliance demands for retention and the business demand for economical storage and retrieval current database management system technology is optimised for transactional processing data warehouses are optimised for analytics but both fail to adequately address archiving needs worse still the lines between archive stores and backup which have very different drivers and requirements are all too often blurred
6008288 forresters research clearly illustrates the need for the new generation of archive stores these deliver both massive reductions in storage footprints through data compression together with the security immutability and point in time query capability that enables quick simple and unimpeachable fulfilment of regulatory obligations

6008315 sometimes i dont like people to see the man behind the curtain i dont like them to know that something wasnt awesome before they saw it
6008316 you know the things we had to tweak the things we had to cut that is inevitable
6008317 but now i dont think it is just us the whole world is so much about seeing behind the curtain and seeing how things are made and how they work and the extended cut and what we could have done and what we didnt do and the alternate ending and you just you kind of take it as part and parcel at the beginning

6008320 there was clearly an agenda behind making the programme designed to make christians look obsessed with peoples sex lives and intent on imposing christian behaviour on everyone else christian behaviour is only possible after a spiritual transformation we were encouraged to take part on the understanding that we were dealing with a group of people who genuinely wanted to embrace christianity but that was clearly not the case

6008325 were actually projecting this year that the north pole may be free of ice for the first time in history
6008326 this summers forecast and unusual early melting events all around the arctic serve as a dire warning of how quickly the polar regions are being affected by climate change
6008327 if norways average temperature this year equals that in 2007 the ice cap in the arctic will all melt away which is highly possible judging from current conditions
6008328 as you can see ice has grown in nearly every direction since last summer with a large increase in the area north of siberia also note that the area around the northwest passage west of greenland has seen a significant increase in ice some of the islands in the canadian archipelago are surrounded by more ice than they were during the summer of 1980
6008329 the arctic did not experience the meltdowns forecast by nsidc and the norwegian polar year secretariat it didnt even come close additionally some current graphs and press releases from nsidc seem less than conservative

6008336 the original was built in 1847 in quebec but this one was built about five years ago in kerry
6008337 in the 1840s it would have carried maybe 200 emigrants on each journey these would have been whole families and people in very poor circumstances
6008338 the bunks would have been very close together they would really be packed in like sardines and if the weather was right they would take turns coming on deck and getting some fresh air
6008339 as you can imagine it could get pretty fetid down there
6008340 the emigrants that came onto this ship were fed because that was included in their deal
6008341 no one ever died on this ship in fact its actually plus one because one woman had a child on board which is unique i imagine
6008342 and the trainees get a feel of what a famine ship was like and also the feel of a sailing ship
6008343 its a great opportunity and anyone who has taken part has always been very happy with it
6008344 were one of very few actual wooden sailing ships many of them now have steel hulls which are very efficient but this is one of very few such ships left

6008349 i was a bit afraid it would actually turn the ship away but it was anchored down

6008371 in respect of a local government which is a body politic of a state government
6008372 our union always thought the idea that local councils could be defined as corporations and so rope in all local government workers under the yoke of the hated work choices laws was questionable

6008477 the fashion police was always a running joke now its a reality in many communities

6008479 do i like the look not particularly do people have the right to wear it yes absolutely
6008480 im not looking for trouble im looking for dialogue im looking for all those who believe in freedom and who can argue with that
6008481 for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so
6008482 emotional incompetence often stems from habits learned early in life these automatic habits are set in place as a normal part of living as experience shapes the brain when habits are strong the underlying neural connections become the brains default option what a person does automatically and spontaneously often with little or no awareness that a menu of possible responses is available
6008483 the desire to be led by a real person demands that we know something of a leaders human foibles and shortcomings
6008484 knowing which weakness to reveal and when is often a highly honed art closely linked to the ability to sense the requirements of different situations
6008485 this is the seventh year of the merchant city festival which has seen it flourish into one of the most exciting and vibrant multi arts platforms in scotland
6008486 this has enabled audiences from far and wide to get a real taste of what is happening in scottish arts and culture
6008487 our programme encompasses scotlands national companies and selected programmes from the magners glasgow international comedy festival the national review of live art and bafta scotland
6008488 from mainland europe we also showcase selections from acclaimed festivals in france spain and austria
6008489 this is really the biggest paradigm shift in innovation since the industrial revolution
6008490 for a couple hundred years or so manufacturers have been really imperfect at understanding peoples needs now people get to decide what they want for themselves
6008491 what weve done is compressed this time using the internet
6008492 its almost less risky to have most talented actors on your stage than to try to do it yourself
6008493 in sport we bow to the numbers and worship the immediate but thats unfairly out of context you dont measure jesse owens against runners 70 years later who have improved equipment training diet its like saying napoleon was a lousy general because he didnt know how to deploy air power
6008494 i can see the peaks i can see trees im surrounded by beauty
6008495 its where i wanted to raise my children its safe and ever since ive been back home its been very difficult to find a place to live
6008496 i was aware it was much more expensive but i was a little deer caught in headlights when we actually moved there
6008497 i wasnt joking when i said well to even enter the real estate market here in flagstaff i would need to be paid twice what i was getting about 100 000
6008498 the key is if we do good architecture beautiful homes that are still affordable you can have something that would be an example demonstration to the community of whats possible
6008499 youd be lucky to get an apartment thats been remodeled and called a townhome
6008500 but im happy with what ive bought but who knows if ill ever be able to move anywhere near flag
6008501 as the very prime places become unaffordable to anybody but the very rich
6008502 people start saying well whats the next prettiest place where do we get the next prettiest view or whats the next prettiest lake that we can afford
6008503 so there is a constant sort of sprawl if you will going on in many of these areas
6008504 when we moved here and had friends come out with us they just thought we were out of our heads
6008505 downtown was largely abandoned and like a lot of these route 66 towns it had been turned over to drunk bars so at 1 oclock at night it was like night of the living dead
6008506 they closed the bars people staggered out there were fights in the streets intoxicated street people everywhere
6008507 i think most americans are kind of groundless because we move all the time were not attached to a place and theres something really compelling about this particular place and its become our home
6008508 ill be taking nearly 50 000 steps its going to wear on your muscles quite a bit more youre gonna be much more fatigued in a shorter period of time
6008509 many of the athletes and surprisingly some of the chinese athletes said this course is going to be very very difficult
6008510 its going to be very hard on the athletes who are already out there struggling for up to four hours
6008511 with elite athletes that are pushing themselves to the edge they will be prone to developing heel pain arch strain mid foot strain as people come forward forefoot pain
6008512 that continued stress over 30 miles may result in the development of a stress fracture
6008513 if one athlete is hurt because of something we knew about beforehand and we didnt put a remedy then we are responsible
6008514 as we told some of the walkers youll never have this much money spent on a walking event in history this is quite a show
6008515 but also traps have gone up significantly buoys rope theyre all made of oil products

6008520 this is incredible because in the past cuba was an important exporter of food

6008522 and i think opportunities should come we have to be patient i have bet on cuba and on the future of cuba and thats why im here we are simply waiting

6008563 ill get him in a headlock for you miss field and cut off his air so hell open his mouth
6008564 i have to marvel at how similar animals and humans can be neither group likes to be forced into anything and try as i might i cant seem to convince him were trudging toward freedom
6008565 well i reckon i could knee him in the chest to make him let go
6008566 your antics are going to get us kicked off the wagon train simon
6008567 he leadeth me beside the still waters he restoreth my soul
6008568 ill take on your watch tonight like we agreed but hickorys getting antsy about having you and your aunt in your own wagon you were last in the row and last to set up camp tonight
6008569 same as every day on this trail i warned you gals i didnt want to take on two women with no menfolk to shoulder the night watches wagons and livestock you know the law of the trail pull your weight or be left behind
6008570 i havent completely mastered the art of unhitching the oxen
6008571 but mr sprouse makes sure our watches arent shirked and you know it
6008572 no call for a man with his own wagon and responsibilities to shoulder yours
6008573 i dont mind taking the extra watch in exchange for their cooking
6008574 youre lagging behind as it is not being able to control your animals is one more hassle to endanger the train one rampaging ox can set off a stampede
6008575 well be ready to pull out at dawn same as everyone else
6008576 let me slice a piece for you to have now while the stew finishes
6008577 when we reach the mountains things will go more slowly
6008578 yep snow can make us lose days get off the trail have so many delays food runs out and animals freeze everythings harder once you hit the rockies
6008579 i hear the mountains are littered with furniture and heirlooms abandoned by travelers so they can get free of a snow bank or make it up a steep pass
6008580 after that rough river crossing we already lost several items
6008581 so we probably wont need to leave anything else behind
6008582 for all those reasons you have to be careful not to get on the trail bosss bad side
6008583 we wont make it without him and hes dead serious about leaving behind anyone who causes problems
6008584 ill clean up and join you in a few moments
6008585 those forceps i ordered should be coming in any day now
6008586 ill make you a rinse of witch hazel to clean it out be sure to drink a lot of water and use the rinse after you eat anything
6008587 though taking things from the ground and putting them in your mouth doesnt help either
6008588 the more you chew the worse itll get keep on and youll see more sores until they spread down your throat and you cant speak
6008589 young and untouched ill give ya a good time sir
6008590 i know a lady who runs a boardinghouse and is in need of some help

6008611 hal pertama yang penting untuk dipertimbangkan adalah mengenai ada tidaknya sertifikat dari laboratorium permata
6008612 untuk permata dibutuhkan minimal lima tahun untuk menunggu agar harga permata menjadi berlipat ganda
6008613 sebagai contoh permata berukuran sepuluh karat kini sangat sulit didapatkan permata semacam ini sangat potensial untuk diinvestasikan
6008614 meskipun berukuran kecil sebuah permata bisa memiliki harga jual tinggi jika memiliki desain yang cantik dan elegan
6008615 o presidente da rep blica decidiu devolver hoje assembleia da rep blica o decreto n 232 x que aprova o regime jur dico do div rcio solicitando que o mesmo seja objecto de nova aprecia o com fundamento na desprotec o do c njuge que se encontre em situa o mais fraca geralmente a mulher bem como dos filhos menores a que na pr tica pode conduzir o diploma conforme explica na mensagem enviada aos deputados
6008616 importa n o abstrair por completo da realidade da vida matrimonial no portugal contempor neo onde subsistem m ltiplas situa es em que um dos c njuges se encontra numa posi o mais d bil n o devendo a lei por ac o ou por omiss o agravar essa fragilidade
6008617 para n o agravar a desprotec o da parte mais fraca o legislador devia ponderar em que medida n o seria prefer vel manter se o regime do div rcio culposo
6008618 ainda poss vel afirmar com algum grau de certeza que o desaparecimento da culpa como causa de div rcio n o far diminuir a litigiosidade conjugal e p s conjugal existindo boas raz es para crer que se ir processar exactamente o inverso
6008619 na verdade no m nimo singular que um c njuge que viole sistematicamente os deveres conjugais previstos na lei possa de forma unilateral e sem mais obter o div rcio e sobretudo possa retirar da vantagens aos mais diversos n veis incluindo patrimonial
6008620 por exemplo numa situa o de viol ncia dom stica em que o marido agride a mulher ao longo dos anos uma realidade que n o rara em portugal poss vel aquele obter o div rcio independentemente da vontade da v tima de maus tratos
6008621 mais ainda o marido apesar de ter praticado reiteradamente actos de viol ncia conjugal pode exigir do outro o pagamento de montantes financeiros

6008640 es gibt tats chlich so etwas wie das vergessene china
6008641 ich vermute dass wieder einmal die landbev lkerung darunter leidet
6008642 die chinesischen bauern waren schon immer darauf angewiesen brunnen zu graben
6008643 die bauern leben buchst blich von der hand in den mund
6008644 die wasserfrage ist meiner meinung nach das gr te problem nordchinas
6008645 die bauern haben das land ja nur gepachtet eigentum konnten und k nnen sie am vergesellschafteten land nicht erwerben
6008646 wenn ein industriekomplex oder auch eine ferienanlage gebaut werden sollen m ssen die bauern ihr land eben abgeben
6008647 die vergesellschaftung des landes ist das einzige berbleibsel des sozialismus
6008648 currently the hospitals use a standard test to work out how far the cancer has progressed and then they use this to determine the treatment the patient should receive however we are potentially able to more accurately predict who would benefit from chemotherapy
6008649 we now aim to carry out more work in this area to develop a prognostic tool which we hope will eventually be for widespread use by the health services in the treatment of bowel cancer
6008650 we have a very high number of patients with bowel cancer in the north east of england in particular we know the best treatment for very early and very late disease but there are still a lot of unknowns in between these two extremes
6008651 chemotherapy can be very useful but can have a number of side effects so we only want to use it where we think theres a good chance it will help this test will help us determine that
6008652 there is a desperate need for more effective treatments for bowel cancer the problem is identifying which cancers need which treatments this discovery may show us the way to do that and help save a lot of lives

6008654 hey mr howard remember when we had a water fight with total strangers on the highway during a traffic jam while going to arkansas
6008655 given the fragility of african agriculture and perpetual famine risks with millions of lives at stake msv is actually one of the most important plant pathogens worldwide
6008656 we wanted to learn more about how the virus emerged and spread so we can develop new ways to fight the diseases it causes
6008657 we found that the maize adapted virus infects a greater variety of grasses than any of the other msv strains
6008658 the virus appears to be spreading around africa faster than the other strains too when we compared the genomes of 11 different strains of msv we discovered that lots of genes had been exchanged between the strains in a process called recombination we also found that every msv that causes severe disease in maize has descended from an ancestral virus that was the recombinant offspring of two relatively harmless wild grass infecting viruses this chance recombination event could be the reason msv has become such a serious problem
6008659 understanding the chain of events that trigger the emergence of novel pathogens is a major goal of epidemiologists worldwide
6008660 there is a lot of circumstantial evidence suggesting how evolutionary processes like recombination might trigger the emergence of a pathogen but there are actually very few well documented examples of this having occurred
6008661 knowing that maize adapted msvs are unusually mobile i hope will prompt scientists to test msv resistance genes against the large bank of virus strains that we have catalogued from across africa
6008662 we are currently testing various resistance strategies some in an advanced stage of development using many of the viruses weve sampled complex genetic strategies like stacking resistance genes and targeting different virus components that cannot be simultaneously exchanged by recombination might ultimately be the only way to control the disease

6008679 it was really hard getting here im happy i stuck to my guns and believed in myself
6008680 id have never forgiven myself if i had not kept on working
6008681 yes i did winning the world championships is not luck its down to my hard work
6008682 when it comes to it i can really work and focus my coach always says all you train for is three days and if you cannot concentrate and focus your mind on those three days then what is all the training for
6008683 thats all i train for throughout the year i hope it is something other athletes can learn from
6008684 im always a positive person no matter what things will always turn out for the best i believe im destined for great things and thats what keeps me going i just get my head down and work
6008685 shes level headed and surrounded by good people she will keep her feet on the ground
6008686 she has had her trials and tribulations and she knows how to treat it

6008709 its the toughest situation to be put in and its the one every bullpen guy should crave
6008710 its the one i crave i made a very below average pitch to an above average hitter and i just paid for it
6008711 that was a key situation for this game we understand that we are playing well right now
6008712 at this point we have no relationship and i dont see that changing
6008713 its just gotten to a point where i think lines were crossed
6008714 if you ask me coaches should be coaches management should be management and i dont think those lines should be crossed but when you cross those lines you put yourself in postiion for things like this to happen

6008839 wir haben uns beim beschleunigen verbessert und nat rlich an den vorder und hinterreifen von bridgestone gearbeitet
6008840 ich bin mit dem test zufrieden weil ich meine rundenzeit aus dem rennen verbessern konnte
6008841 wir haben haupts chlich am setup gearbeitet um eine bessere balance zu finden am wochenende hatten wir gerade einmal zwei stunden um das motorrad kennen zu lernen also haben wir heute vormittag einige verschiedene l sungen am heck ausprobiert und sobald wir mit dem basis setup zufrieden waren haben wir einige reifen getestet und uns f r den besten weg entschieden
6008842 wir haben uns im vergleich zum rennen stark verbessert trotzdem d rfen wir nicht vergessen dass wir noch weit weg sind wir d rfen nicht aufgeben

6008885 wir waren in ungarn gut dabei das auto hat sich gut angef hlt und wir haben gezeigt dass wir uns noch immer weiterentwickeln
6008886 wir werden hart k mpfen um in der konstrukteurswertung vierter zu werden es war vor allem wichtig f r uns noch vor der sommerpause ein gutes resultat einzufahren das tut der stimmung im team gut und das hei t dass wir motiviert nach valencia gehen k nnen
6008887 es ist immer etwas besonderes f r mich wenn ich vor meinen landsleuten fahren darf ich freue mich wirklich darauf in barcelona hatten wir ein starkes rennen bis zu dem moment wo ich aufgeben musste aber ich hoffe dass ich diesmal ein gutes resultat einfahren kann denn die strecke ist f r alle neu
6008888 es wird f r mich und das team sehr interessant werden die mannschaft hat in den letzten monaten hart an den vorbereitungen f r dieses rennen gearbeitet f r die fahrer ist diese neue strecke die chance um zu zeigen wozu man in der lage ist aber ich mache mir keine illusionen alle fahrer werden wieder schnell sein wir m ssen einfach unser bestes tun
6008889 es stimmt ich mag stra enkurse sie sind einfach immer wieder eine besondere herausforderung das gef hl das man im cockpit hat ist wahnsinn
6008890 ich bin ziemlich gl cklich dar ber dass ich in ungarn punkte einfahren konnte das war wichtig f r das team und f r mich alles in allem war es ein sehr positives wochenende f r uns

6008892 if you photographers are looking for brad pitt im not the guy

6008894 its a fast track im ready to go well see thursday i just want to win whatever time i do i will be happy
6008895 i knew what i could do the races i lost i didnt execute the right way thats all ive got to do is execute and ill be fine
6008896 were here at the games its time to show down and throw down
6008897 the matchup between me and him theres other athletes out there who can run just as fast as we can as you saw in the first round looks like its going to be a fast final no matter who makes it in there
6008898 i dont call him and say you want to go here or there
6008899 but the respect is there we know each others talent i know hes a great athlete he knows im coming he knows im great neither of us are poor sportsmen and both of us are american so love and respect is there
6008900 weve been running ever since we came here many years ago
6008901 now the whole world wanna know how we running so they say there must be something in the air down there in jamaica that make jamaicans run like the wind
6008902 quarrie winning gold in the 200 in the 1976 olympics and silver in the 100 was a catapult for a lot of kids who thought if i work hard i can be like don quarrie
6008903 now youre going to have more kids being spurred on to be the next usain bolt
6008904 no organisation will ever be able to claim it has 100 of staff crb checked
6008905 this is due to natural turnover and the length of time the process takes
6008906 we have taken on board these findings by taking immediate and decisive action and we can reassure residents that vulnerable children in surrey are not unsafe
6008907 russian citizens are proud that russia came to the defense of the weaker one that it came to the defense of its compatriots that it stopped bloodshed

6008911 we believe the company could achieve significant operating cost savings
6008912 though it may be challenged to meet its financial targets of 300 million in ebitda in 2009 and positive free cash flow
6008913 until additional information becomes available regarding the ultimate capitalization and the effect of cost saving plans and growth initiatives on secured and unsecured recovery at sirius and xm
6008914 firstly there needs to be an institutional and governance framework to ensure smooth transparent and effective decisions on the conduct of monetary policy and other central bank policies including the mode of operation of the gcc central bank inflation should be the priority item on the policy agenda there is need for a change in monetary policy towards inflation targeting with monetary policy geared to maintaining inflation within an announced target range the gcc countries will need to invest in building their statistical capacity in order to provide harmonized comparable economic and financial data to support the gmu and the gulf common market the gmu if it is to be achieved and serve its purpose needs to be supported by investments in financial infrastructure including legal and regulatory payment systems and the development and linkage of money markets and capital markets to ensure a uniform interest rate and the swift transfer of funds throughout the gcc
6008915 ich finde es vor allem spannend zu sehen welche fahrer auf einer neuen strecke am besten zurecht kommen
6008916 ein neuer kurs gibt jedem fahrer die chance zu zeigen was wirklich in ihm steckt
6008917 das wird einigen fahrern schwierigkeiten bereiten denn ein fehler endet meistens mit verlorenen r dern
6008918 mclaren und bmw waren in montreal und melbourne sehr stark sie haben f r mich auch in valencia gute chancen
6008919 wenn ich ein rennen fahre dann will ich es auch gewinnen es macht nie besonderen spa nur f nfter oder gar sechster zu werden selbst der dritte platz f hlt sich f r mich nicht mehr besonders gut an
6008920 wer denkt dass ich unmotiviert oder m de bin liegt falsch
6008921 noch ist nichts verloren aber wir m ssen konstant bessere ergebnisse abliefern
6008922 mein ziel ist es am ende der saison einen punkt mehr zu haben als meine rivalen
6008923 wenn es nicht so hei wird sollte das ferrari helfen
6008924 wie in montreal braucht man hier auch ein bisschen gl ck hoffentlich wird es f r mich nicht genauso ausgehen wie in kanada
6008925 wir beginnen gerade die produktionsphase der hauptkomponenten f r das 2009er auto
6008926 ferrari hat die f higkeiten und ressourcen um am neuen auto zu arbeiten ohne auch nur f r eine sekunde bei der entwicklung des f2008 zur ckstecken zu m ssen
6008927 hoffentlich werden wir die ersten sein die ihren namen auf einen valencia siegerpokal schreiben d rfen
6008928 ich mache keine vorhersagen das rennen in ungarn hat gezeigt wie unw gbar die formel 1 ist
6008929 ich werde alles daf r geben dass dies so bleibt
6008930 ich will in diesem jahr noch mehr rennen gewinnen und regelm ig spitzenpl tze einfahren
6008931 in der ersten saisonh lfte gelang mir das ab und zu jetzt glaube ich dass mir das fter gelingen kann und darauf freue ich mich

6008935 what were concerned about is the chance that someone might half consciously check the independent box and then vote the straight democratic party elections observer who has seen the ballot the elections office acknowledges that voters could make that mistake but they believe the instructions on the ballot will guide voters through the process in addition voting machines will return ballots with overvotes and voters will be allowed to redo their selections before they leave the polling place most people believe they are independent with a small i
6008936 that is going to confuse some people and cause a lot of votes to be lost
6008937 our fundraising has been slow which kind of goes hand in hand for this time of year
6008938 im not surprised if were where we are by the end of september then i will be concerned
6008939 the question is reaching as many people as we can
6008940 its the legislators who will be deciding who the delegates are
6008941 they will be the ones who decide what questions get raised in the convention and if anything happens at all
6008942 the state constitution works and theres already a procedure in place to amend it without holding a taxpayer funded convention
6008943 harusnya kamu jangan terlalu memanjakannya supaya dia nggak sakit banget kalau nanti kalian berpisah
6008944 harusnya kamu tidak takut mati sebab mati adalah keniscayaan buat yang hidup mati hanya satu fase hidup yang lain meski kedengaran mengerikan toh kamu bisa belajar tentang apa apa yang kamu yakini bisa menjadi bekal kamu sesudah mati nanti dan itu tidak berarti harus menyiksa diri kamu dan menyia nyiakan hidup yang dianugerahkannya dengan membayangkan memikirkan bagaimana rasanya menjadi mati tuhan tidak memberikan kamu hidup untuk membuat kamu tersiksa memikirkan mati dan menyia nyiakan hidup itu sendiri jika kamu berani memutuskan untuk mencintai dan bersama dengan orang yang kamu cintai harusnya kamu tidak takut berpisah sebab berpisah adalah keniscayaan buat yang bersama meski kedengarannya menyakitkan toh kamu bisa belajar tentang apa apa yang kamu yakini bisa menjadi bekal kamu sesudah berpisah nanti takdir yang membelitkan hidup dengan mati adalah takdir yang sama yang membelitkan bersama dengan berpisah tidak hanya belitan kata tapi belitan makna dan itu tidak berarti harus menyiksa diri kamu dan menyia nyiakan kebersamaan yang dianugerahkannya dengan membayangkan memikirkan bagaimana rasanya berpisah tuhan tidak membiarkan kamu bersama untuk membuat kamu tersiksa memikirkan bepisah dan menyia nyiakan kebersamaan itu sendiri
6008945 lihat aku percaya tuhan hanya beri yang terbaik aku tidak peduli dengan mati itu urusan nanti kini aku hanya perlu menjalani hidup yang terbaik lihat aku juga tidak peduli dengan urusan berpisah itu urusan nanti kini aku melakukan yang terbaik sepanjang masih bersama total menjalani hidup akan membuatku puas ketika mati total mengisi kebersamaan dengan hal hal yang berarti akan membuatku puas menebarkan bakti
6008946 alles spricht ber valencia ich bin vor der sommerpause schon dort gewesen und im training der formel 3 sogar schon eineinhalb stunden auf der strecke gefahren was ich dort gesehen und befahren habe gef llt mir sehr gut
6008947 der kurs bietet mehr als nur einen wechsel aus ganz langsamen kurven und geraden die zudem oft keine echten geraden sind sondern einen leichten knick haben das rennen sollte also interessant werden
6008948 die br cke ist ein bisschen eng beim anbremsen und einlenken wenn man dort einen fehler macht liegt man sofort in der mauer oder gleich im wasser
6008949 perfekt ist keine rennstrecke auch in valencia gibt es ein paar kritische stellen aber das geh rt zum motorsport dazu gerade bei stra enkursen kann man keine h user oder br cken abrei en

6008962 el sujeto normalizado y que vive conforme a la ley est acechado por el espectro de un doble por un sujeto que materializa la voluntad de transgredir la ley con un placer perverso por eso el club de la lucha dif cilmente es una respuesta

6008985 we know that during ramadan many patients change the times they take their medicines or even the number of doses they take each day without first seeking medical advice
6008986 spending a few minutes discussing their plans with a pharmacist can identify potential problems and discuss possible solutions
6008987 we encourage all our regular customers to have a medicine check but with ramadan approaching they are particularly useful for people intending to fast

6009030 this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone
6009031 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defense site that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of a long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6009032 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 per cent
6009033 both sides have achieved their goals this is a great success for poland
6009034 for that reason no one who has good intentions toward us and toward the western world should be afraid of it
6009035 the idea was for virgin megastores to create something special that would garner attention and showcase the great films that warner bros has produced over the past 85 years
6009036 weve created the largest in store marketing design that weve ever done for a partner which includes a 40x20 foot in store billboard with an epson projection screen in the middle of it we have utilized a huge part of our times square megastore to help promote the anniversary of one of the top studios in the world its been a fantastic opportunity to work with a partner in such a creative large pop up store environment
6009037 virgin megastores have offered us a larger than life eye catching and interactive design to reintroduce great classics to a new generation of filmgoers
6009038 they came to us with this creative concept that truly will help us raise the visibility of our studios anniversary and the worlds largest library of film
6009039 our clients were incensed by the level of illegal downloading in the first 14 days since topware interactive released dream pinball 3d it sold 800 legitimate copies but was illegally downloaded 12 000 times hopefully people will think twice if they risk being taken to court
6009040 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
6009041 a police officer of seven years on medical leave labelled as a hero for being wounded in the line of duty got up in front of the world and told the world of how he and mr dyer uncovered this creature
6009042 on august 16 the freezer containing the alleged corpse arrived with the searching for bigfoot team
6009043 the ice was being thawed slowly without aid to prevent any decomposition of the alleged corpse we estimated that the freezer and its contents weighed over 1 500lbs and it would take several days or longer to thaw completely
6009044 the following day we were up early to discover that some hair was now exposed i extracted some from the alleged corpse examined it and had some concerns
6009045 we began an expedited melting process within one hour we were able to see the partially exposed head i was able to feel that it seemed mostly firm but unusually hollow in one small section this was yet another ominous sign
6009046 within the next hour of thaw a break appeared up near the feet area as the team and i began examining this area near the feet i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
6009047 later that day we were informed that mr whitton and mr dyer had admitted it was a costume

6009065 we are against the agreement between unmik and eulex because it violates un security council resolution 1244 and international law
6009066 the serbian government does not accept the reconfiguration of unmik nor the agreement with eulex

6009072 i think i speak on behalf of everyone in this room when i say i dont believe i have received an answer to my question is the international olympic committee ioc embarrassed by the way the chinese authorities are treating the journalists

6009074 the press briefing used to be the place you unfortunately had to go
6009075 you just have to understand we have our own style of democracy and you have to respect the countrys system
6009076 mr wang let me pick up from where we left off two days ago
6009077 how many applications for protests were filed and how many permits were granted
6009078 changing commercial nature and importance of tif and the general economic crisis that has negatively affected the car market in greece
6009079 a first recommendation deals with the existance of a clause in unilever hellass contracts with eight supermarkets forbidding imports over the same period of time in 2000 2003
6009080 on the positive side we have an increase in exports and the increase in net travel and transport receipts despite this the gap widened due to the huge increase in oil costs by about 50 percent and the increase in imports excluding shipping and oil
6009081 this decision shows the determination of the ioc to broaden the fight against doping to those behind athletes
6009082 there is always a market for historical novels in serbia
6009083 serbia is the only country where the book has actually been sold
6009084 its the first of its kind search engine for our community its not a website a search engine it is a place where we can come and find anything that we currently get from google yahoo and msn you can now find it at a place thats made for us by us its a hot new product we have all the jobs in the world we crawl the world wide web for jobs and cutting edge news not just black news but the latest news
6009085 were on a promotional tour we started in chicago went to nashville atlanta cincinnati l a things are good god is good
6009086 we can spread a rumor in a second its time to spread some good news
6009087 and the good news is we finally have our own search engine im pleased to say at the end of our second full operating month we had 800 000 unique visitors so business is good but we need more of em
6009088 the notion came upon me that anybody can search but i was having great difficulty finding things that matter to us
6009089 youd like to think things like cancer are race neutral but cancer is black or white how we get it the things that impact how black people deal with the treatment regimen all that is different i looked for it but there is really nothing that spoke to how black men deal with it so i said gosh it would be great if we could merge all the stuff from the national cancer society the national institute of health all the right places the authorities but also get that information that is specifically relevant to black people because then we are making a difference knowledge is power i really believe that
6009090 google has much of the information that we have but its on page 50 its on page 100 its on page 1 000 what we do is elevate the black results to the first three pages which differentiates us
6009091 everyone thought what we would simply do is take a term like comedy and prefix black or african american but you find out very quickly that black comedy on a search engine does not give you martin lawrence and eddie murphy it gives you dark humor so its not as simple as prefixing black and african american to your search terms there is a real algorithm
6009092 it is the first time the african american community has a legitimate technology play a search engine
6009093 i liked it because it was easy to spell and the action words rush for more information and you drive the web instead of searching the web
6009094 our first angle was to found a business and finding a name was the last thing we did we launched the company in april and didnt figure out our name until february because the idea was to figure out what our community wants we had focus groups i found that black folks wanted something they didnt want a black search engine they wanted a search engine for the black community so rushmoredrive is a search tool at its core complemented by features like jobs and news
6009095 alright maam ill be more than glad to help you with that what seems to be the problem
6009096 maam it appears that everything is working just fine from both ends what exactly is happening when you try to call out from your phone
6009097 absolutely nothing jesus are you stupid i already told you that
6009098 right lets try this turn your phone off and then back on maybe you just need to reset it
6009099 this is very strange i cant imagine why it would not be working try this for me dial a number out and lets see if you get an error message now that the phone has been reset
6009100 you stupid little b there is no f ing dial tone
6009101 how can i dial a number if i dont have a dial tone
6009102 maam the phone youre using is wireless its not going to have a dial tone

6009112 i recognized that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being
6009113 i feel now at 53 i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
6009114 i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
6009115 for that reason no one who has good intentions toward us and toward the western world should be afraid of it
6009116 this storm is going to be with us for a while thats obvious now it looks like it could be a boomerang storm
6009117 its very seldom were hoping for a hurricane but we are
6009118 i know people hate drought but when youre talking about a tropical cyclone relieving drought conditions be careful what you wish for
6009119 our biggest concern is complacency jacksonville has a history of being shielded from storm systems while we dont want anyone to panic we want everyone in the area to take this storm seriously
6009120 i just came in from the fields everything is burning up
6009121 if a storm is brewing down there just send it up i 26

6009125 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
6009126 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
6009127 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
6009128 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
6009129 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them you can send them home and ill paddle them or you can have me come out to the school and we can both paddle them
6009130 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
6009131 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time
6009132 we teach our children that violence is wrong yet corporal punishment teaches children that violence is a way to solve problems
6009133 it perpetuates a cycle of child abuse it teaches children to hit someone smaller and weaker when angry
6009134 the fire from jet fuel does not burn hot enough to produce the physical evidence that hes produced
6009135 so when youve got science that the hypothesis doesnt explain evidence then the hypothesis doesnt stand anymore it doesnt mean theres a new hypothesis youve validated it just means the governments explanation of the jet fuel fire is not a sufficient explanation to explain the evidence of these spheres these microscopic spheres that steven jones has proved existed within the w t c dust

6009248 yes dragon age origins will be coming to consoles in the near future yes
6009249 revolutionise multi terrain racing with the largest environment ever created in race gaming
6009250 we can confirm that the game has indeed passed final certification with microsoft on friday the 15th of august on our first try no less that means the game is done it is now in the hands of microsoft at this time we cannot give you details on release date or points cost as we do not have that information theres plenty of really cool stuff in this new update to a classic title
6009251 weve been lucky enough to make legacy of kain eternal darkness too human and if you look at all of those theyre all really different
6009252 the next game that were going to announce not including the sequels to the trilogy its nothing like anything else weve ever made before
6009253 seriously yes were still here and working hard on getting alan wake for you to enjoy sure weve been in development for a long time and if everything had gone perfectly smoothly there probably would be a game out for you guys to play already but designing a completely new game can be hard and sometimes you need to take a detour to find the best route forward
6009254 we want to entertain you guys in the best possible way and our team is putting in every effort possible in order for that to happen that is the way remedy wants to do things im sure you will enjoy alan wake when were done
6009255 a huge inspiration the wmd happens when youre starting to lose youve got something called defcon one and defcon one is the last five minutes of the game which is the last lap of mario kart when the guy whos in second place gets the red shell the red shell concept here is giving the guy whos losing a wmd because of the ability to spike him up those two things can turn the tide of war so youve got this tug of war at the end of the game which is really really fun
6009256 at its heart a strategy game you have a battlefield the pitch
6009257 great pc games but fundamentally theyre not suited to consoles they werent built with consoles in mind
6009258 if you enjoyed those this ones gonna blow you away
6009259 i love la but london watch out im coming to town and bringing my fast paced life with me ive decided to look for a new bff across the pond
6009260 i need a best friend who is hot who can keep up with me and most of all who is real and wont be a backstabber
6009261 im not leaving london until i find that amazing girl or guy who can meet the challenges of being my british bestie
6009262 a separate and more cumbersome voting procedure for a whole group of edison residents based solely on their religion
6009263 study guides online i dont think they are a good idea students can get things wrong and alot of the time and this can mess up a students understanding of the book whats wrong with discussing a book with the class you still get the same benifits without the uncertainty of not know whether what you are typing is right or not
6009264 with a book for example it would be hard to trust anything written by a bunch of year 10 students about a book they probably havent even read so why would we write a study guide about it you would have to trust everything the writter says where as when you learn by discussing it as a class you get more active and you get more out of the experience by learning what other people have to say
6009265 in my opinion technology is fun but learning things from a qualified teacher may be better than from year 10 students online

6009269 translating darwishs poetry was a dream of beauty of art with the glimmer that art will lead to cultural and mutual respect among peoples and in making the translations i focused as much on the strange in the poems as on the familiar and the universal
6009270 to savour the solid and carefully crafted building blocks of darwishs bold and delicate imagery and the echoes of his sound patterns
6009271 darwish has long been an eloquent voice for palestinian identity aspirations and rights but his poetry is never reducible to politics and this volume above all communicates darwishs mighty artistic presence at this utterly mature period of his poetic career
6009272 this is a very good idea if she can get clean and still see blake it can only be good

6009274 mit diesem links schwenk er ffnet wiefelsp tz eine sinnlose debatte wohl um von anderen vers umnissen abzulenken anders als die rentenversicherung werden die versorgungssysteme l ngst vom umlageverfahren auf kapitaldeckung umgestellt das schafft nicht nur mehr sicherheit f r die betroffenen sondern auch eine nachhaltige entlastung f r die haushalte von bund l ndern und kommunen indem man immer mehr besch ftigtengruppen in die rentenversicherung zwingt l st man kein einziges ihrer strukturellen probleme
6009275 auch der erwartung von unions fraktions vize wolfgang bosbach dass alle elemente der rentenreform wirkungsgleich auf die pensionen bertragen werden sollen wird bereits seit jahren rechnung getragen und ist vom dbb akzeptierte praxis
6009276 das prinzip der wirkungsgleichheit war schon 2004 im rahmen der reform und modernisierung des beamtendienstrechts ausdr cklich gegenstand einer vereinbarung zwischen dem damaligen bundesinnenminister otto schily ver di chef frank bsirske und uns da gibt es nichts nachzubessern

6009280 leipzig ist in diesen tagen das gravitationszentrum der europ ischen spieleindustrie die branche schaut nach leipzig wartet gespannt auf die signale die von der wichtigsten messe des jahres f r den deutschen und den europ ischen markt ausgehen
6009281 die leipziger games convention setzt somit ihre rasante erfolgsgeschichte fort seit ihrer premiere 2002 w chst die messe von jahr zu jahr sowohl die zahlen der aussteller als auch die der besucher und der vermieteten fl chen sind gestiegen
6009282 keine andere messe hat den messestandort deutschland in den vergangenen jahren so schnell in einer branche verankert wie die games convention
6009283 das engagement des verbandes f r die etablierung einer neuen deutschen branchenmesse zur kenntnis zu nehmen

6009295 its a concern that kids will become so obsessed with these games that the concept of playing a real guitar will be far too much effort for them and that will lead to less bands starting up
6009296 es ist zwar neu dass man l nger vor dem video oder vor dem computer sitzt aber das hat offensichtlich keine auswirkungen auf den generellen energieverbrauch

6009305 im gro en und ganzen gibt es mehrere verschiedene dimensionen in denen videospiele effekte auf menschen aus ben k nnen
6009306 ein pauschalurteil ber videospiele kann deshalb nicht abgegeben werden sie sind weder gut noch schlecht
6009307 videospiele k nnen ein m chtiges erziehungs und trainingswerkzeug sein und effekte nach sich ziehen die f r uns sehr berraschend sind
6009308 un bersichtliche tarifangebote komplizierte vertr ge lange dienstwege und k ndigungsfristen sollen dem kunden dabei erspart bleiben
6009309 unser ziel ist es dem kunden ein produkt anzubieten mit dem er auf einfachstem weg telefonkosten sparen kann
6009310 vor allem kleinere lokale bankeninstitute die w hrend der krise falsch aufgestellt gewesen sind geraten unter druck und m ssen unter umst nden sogar insolvenz anmelden in diesem zusammenhang kann es f r kleine banken wichtig werden gespr che mit gr eren instituten zu suchen
6009311 kleinere banken k nnen dies erheblich weniger tun und sind im fall der f lle eher auf kooperationen mit gr eren partnern angewiesen um nicht bankrott zu gehen
6009312 this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone
6009313 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defense site that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of a long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6009314 both sides have achieved their goals this is a great success for poland
6009315 se i comportamenti che adotta in ossequio alla sua responsabilit sociale riducono il reddito degli azionisti dellimpresa il manager sta spendendo i loro quattrini se le sue azioni fanno aumentare il prezzo al consumo il dirigente sta spendendo i soldi dei consumatori se le sue decisioni comportano una riduzione del salario dei dipendenti dellazienda egli sta spendendo i soldi dei lavoratori
6009316 il dibattito sulla responsabilit sociale dimpresa affascinante anche perch riconosce implicitamente il fallimento delle istituzioni pubbliche nel perseguire finalit socialmente condivise e cerca di porre tali fini in capo alle imprese
6009317 ma se questo dibattito ammette implicitamente come le imprese siano pi efficaci nel creare ricchezza e benessere di qualsiasi altra istituzione il fatto che esse adottino responsabilit sociali in conflitto con lobiettivo di creare valore per gli azionisti rischia di snaturarle indebolendone lefficienza e danneggiando anche dipendenti e consumatori

6009326 es gibt keine verhandlungen mit der deutschen bank mehr vor allem die vorstellungen ber den preis klafften zu weit auseinander
6009327 it begleitet uns ein leben lang und ist die basis f r wirtschaftliches wachstum sie schafft in den n chsten vier jahren weltweit etwa 7 1 millionen neue arbeitspl tze microsoft f rdert daher das auseinandersetzen mit software und deren m glichkeiten schon an den schulen und hochschulen dreamspark gibt studierenden mehr m glichkeiten und flexibilit t in ihrer ausbildung
6009328 egal ob es um spiele entwicklung das erstellen von webseiten oder das l sen von programmieraufgaben f r die uni geht unsere entwicklungs und design software ist nun f r studierende kostenlos zu beziehen und damit noch einfacher nutzbar
6009329 mir als wissenschaftsminister ist es ein besonderes anliegen junge menschen f r den vorbehaltslosen umgang mit moderner technologie zu begeistern die wissenschaftliche arbeit als auch die innovation an unseren hochschulen kann mit dem richtigen einsatz von vertiefenden it kenntnissen noch kreativere leistungen erbringen in der lehre und in der forschung aber auch f r sterreichs unternehmen die den mangel an qualifiziertem technikernachwuchs oft beklagen ist das ein wichtiges signal
6009330 moderne technologie und entsprechende software ist aus keiner wissenschaft und aus keinem studienalltag mehr wegzudenken wir begr en daher die microsoft initiative die vielen unserer studierenden die m glichkeit bietet sich weitere it qualifikationen anzueignen
6009331 das wird sich negativ auf die spielqualit t auswirken das volksgut wird mehr und mehr leiden bis am ende der deutsche profi fu ball auf griechischem niveau angekommen ist er wurde dann kaputt gesch tzt

6009333 die 20 vereine der englischen premier league strichen in der abgelaufenen spielzeit allein 1 2 mrd euro an tv geldern ein
6009334 die argumente des kartellamtes sind sehr konstruiert und anma end wer bitte definiert denn dass eine zusammenfassung im free tv vor 20 uhr verbraucherfreundlicher ist als eine sp tere zusammenfassung der erstligaspiele
6009335 dieses ergebnis war eine gro e berraschung f r uns
6009336 insgesamt zwei speziell ausgebildete hunde unterst tzen das artenschutzteam jetzt
6009337 wir haben vor gut einem jahr dem deutschen zoll unser konzept vorgestellte damals h tte ich nicht vermutet dass bereits im sommer 2008 in frankfurt artenschutzsp rhunde auf patrouille gehen
6009338 wir haben es hierbei mit einer sehr gut organisierten schmuggelmafia zu tun
6009339 das problem dabei ist dass nicht nur die arten durch derartigen handel gef hrdet werden sondern dass zudem ein enormer ansturm auf die einheimischen zoos losbricht denn in denen werden die eingeschmuggelten tiere dann betreut
6009340 sie k nnen selbst objekte mit geringem eigengeruch wahrnehmen und sind daher ideal f r die schnelle kontrolle von gep ckst cken postsendungen oder ganzen containern
6009341 es ist mir ein pers nliches anliegen den artenschmuggel zu bek mpfen und so zum berleben bedrohter tier und pflanzenarten beizutragen
6009342 derzeit ist es noch schwer zu sagen welches ziel der hersteller mit diesem ger t verfolgt als zielgruppe kommen jedenfalls privatkunden in frage jedoch denke ich nicht dass das handy als konkurrent zum iphone sowie zu den blackberrys positioniert wird

6009345 die probleme im finanzsektor sind weiterhin folgen der subprime krise obgleich direkter oder indirekter art f r die banken ist es angesichts der dadurch ausgel sten finanzkrise schwierig sich zu refinanzieren
6009346 die plattform ist f r die n chsten server cpu generationen vorbereitet und kommt sowohl mit shanghai als auch mit dessen nachfolger zurecht
6009347 schlie lich brachte der hersteller seit einf hrung des opteron 2003 keine all in one l sung mehr an den start

6009354 wenn es richtig gemacht wird kann abwasser ohne weiteres zur bew sserung verwendet werden
6009355 die wesentlichste frage ist und bleibt nat rlich welche substanzen sich im abwasser befinden dabei ist es entscheidend ob es sich um haushaltsabw sser oder um industrieabw sser handelt
6009356 in den usa darf frischgem se beispielsweise nicht mit solchen abw ssern bew ssert werden
6009357 in jedem fall sollte die ausbildung und information zu abwasser f r bew sserung verbessert und in entwicklungsl ndern st rker unterst tzt werden da je nach abwasser art der behandlung und anbaukulturen die gesundheitsrisiken stark variieren
6009358 a good teacher is the best tool for a good education
6009359 there is hardly an african head of state that doesnt know how to spell wimax
6009360 we dont focus as hard as we should on education we dont focus as hard as we should on incentivising innovation
6009361 while there was a small month on month increase in activity it represented a notable decline from a year ago this continues the weaker picture seen in june and points towards the more subdued levels of lending we are likely to see in the second half of 2008
6009362 to see it in real life and that it exists its just unbelievable it really is
6009363 hes done 40 years of service to this state getting money for the state for stuff we absolutely need hes a great man
6009364 this indictment thing you go to washington d c and if anybody can throw the first stone id like to meet them
6009365 has done so much for the state and it took time to build up the seniority to be able to do it why throw that away
6009366 theres a definite attitude of wanting a change to the point where a lot of people dont care what it is just make a change get them out we hear that on both sides of the aisle republican and democrat
6009367 we could lose this could become a blue state obama could take this state
6009368 can you imagine if sen stevens is spending the final five weeks of this campaign in a federal courthouse facing felony corruption charges and every night the news is covering it hes going to lose 2 to 1 in november
6009369 people are i dont know if disgusted is the right word but with the appearance that you can do these things and think youre going to get away with it
6009370 and the other thing is it seems like theyve all sold out for very little money and thats kind of embarrassing
6009371 if the election were held tomorrow i think ted stevens would beat me
6009372 this is what our democracys all about people go up and say i have a better dream i think i can represent the people a little bit better then the american people get to choose
6009373 what hes said is i think i have some experience i have seniority youve blessed me with that seniority and now theres more things we can do together in terms of an economic future for alaska
6009374 alaskans two years ago really began to take back the government as a people alaskans were disgusted with backroom negotiations a lack of transparency in public processes and just a lack of ethics and character in government

6009376 microsoft flight simulator 2004 cant run under a remote desktop session and will now quit
6009377 but also traps have gone up significantly buoys rope theyre all made of oil products
6009378 and our catch price is a little bit lower than it was last year
6009379 we put stronger emphasis on other seafoods on black angus steaks and our italian meals
6009380 we want to sell a wider variety of foods to appeal to a wider audience the lobster entrees used to be close to 40 percent of sales of our meals and now its in the high 20s
6009381 this is really the biggest paradigm shift in innovation since the industrial revolution
6009382 for a couple hundred years or so manufacturers have been really imperfect at understanding peoples needs now people get to decide what they want for themselves
6009383 what weve done is compressed this time using the internet
6009384 its almost less risky to have most talented actors on your stage than to try to do it yourself
6009385 las vacaciones que te mereces con toda la calidad en espa a
6009386 contrato con el csc saxo hasta el 31 de diciembre de 2008

6009389 i can see the peaks i can see trees im surrounded by beauty
6009390 its where i wanted to raise my children its safe and ever since ive been back home its been very difficult to find a place to live
6009391 i was aware it was much more expensive but i was a little deer caught in headlights when we actually moved there
6009392 i wasnt joking when i said well to even enter the real estate market here in flagstaff i would need to be paid twice what i was getting about 100 000
6009393 the key is if we do good architecture beautiful homes that are still affordable you can have something that would be an example demonstration to the community of whats possible
6009394 youd be lucky to get an apartment thats been remodeled and called a townhome
6009395 but im happy with what ive bought but who knows if ill ever be able to move anywhere near flag
6009396 as the very prime places become unaffordable to anybody but the very rich
6009397 people start saying well whats the next prettiest place where do we get the next prettiest view or whats the next prettiest lake that we can afford
6009398 so there is a constant sort of sprawl if you will going on in many of these areas
6009399 when we moved here and had friends come out with us they just thought we were out of our heads
6009400 downtown was largely abandoned and like a lot of these route 66 towns it had been turned over to drunk bars so at 1 oclock at night it was like night of the living dead
6009401 they closed the bars people staggered out there were fights in the streets intoxicated street people everywhere

6009610 help us to protect our brand by deleting the definition of
6009611 receiving the body and blood of christ unworthily is a sacrilege
6009612 if it is done deliberately in mortal sin it is a sacrilege
6009613 public officials who with knowledge and consent uphold actions that are against the divine and eternal moral law for example if they support abortion which entails the taking of innocent and defenseless human lives a person who commits sin in this way should be publicly admonished in such a way as to not receive communion until he or she has reformed his life
6009614 if a person who has been admonished persists in public mortal sin and attempts to receive communion the minister of the eucharist has the obligation to deny it to him why above all for the salvation of that person preventing him from committing a sacrilege
6009615 we must avoid giving people the impression that one can be in a state of mortal sin and receive the eucharist
6009616 secondly there could be another form of scandal consisting of leading people to think that the public act that this person is doing which until now everyone believed was a serious sin is really not that serious if the church allows him or her to receive communion
6009617 if we have a public figure who is openly and deliberately upholding abortion rights and receiving the eucharist what will the average person think he or she could come to believe that it up to a certain point it is okay to do away with an innocent life in the mothers womb
6009618 it is not with the intention of interfering in public life but rather in the spiritual state of the politician or public official who if catholic should follow the divine law in the public sphere as well
6009619 therefore it is simply ridiculous and wrong to try to silence a pastor accusing him of interfering in politics so that he cannot do good to the soul of a member of his flock
6009620 analyzed the political and social situation that the country is experiencing we have agreed unanimously to ratify our pronouncement on the 28th of july
6009621 has been exposed to public opinion in a clear and exact way by our representatives especially by monsenor antonio arregui
6009622 we recall that we are making this declaration because it is always and everywhere the role of the church to proclaim moral principles including those referring to the social order as well as giving its judgment on any and all matters relating to humanity to the extent to which they are required by the fundamental rights of the human person or the salvation of souls catechism of the catholic church par
6009623 the modus vivendi signed by the holy see and the government of ecuador february 14 1937 asks the ecuadorian clergy to stay out of political parties and political contests art 4

6009627 we have had no communication with the vessel so far the distress call was relayed through another ship but the tanker has been confirmed seized by pirates
6009628 this is the fourth hijacking in a month we call upon the un and the international community to take immediate steps to stop the worsening situation
6009629 parts of the walls have fallen off the fence is destroyed cars are buried under the rubble
6009630 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6009631 this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone
6009632 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defense site that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of a long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6009633 when you think about how we make decisions for cars and mortgages and how we eliminate options based on cost thats not necessarily the case for college
6009634 at some point if its going to totally put a familys finances in jeopardy rationality needs to factor in
6009635 ill be damned if im going into this game not believing we can win and everybodys got to feel the same
6009636 the first thing ive tried to do over the last 48 hours is show my team how we can win and to leave the meeting last night with the belief that we can win
6009637 the game plan would have to be played perfectly but to just say yeah weve got the possibility of doing this yeah we can do it
6009638 you could make a movie on this if we won this game its david and goliath its rocky

6009644 beckhams story is a modern day fairytale of heroes villains love manchester united and what it means to lead your country
6009645 his rise from obscurity to international stardom his universally acknowledged gifts as a supreme sportsman and his hollywood lifestyle all have the elements of an aspirational fable
6009646 with football and celebrity now firmly established as new secular western religions the theatre of dreams is set within a cheering football stadium the modern day church the music is powerful gospel like rock to establish clearly football and manchester united as a religion
6009647 with half the world supporting united and the rest worshipping beckham a musical about the iconic life of the beckhams would be certain to attract huge attention

6009651 i understand most people are accustomed to not seeing a lot of clothing on the beach or in the water
6009652 we dont want to look like freaks or stick out like sore thumbs for being so covered up on the beach but i wanted to help make water activity accessible to muslim women
6009653 they say you dont truly miss something or know how much it meant to you until its gone or taken away from you and i have missed it
6009654 im just looking forward to taking this step by step and doing these games and then we can see afterwards where things lie
6009655 i feel very very fit but i still have a long way to go
6009656 i think that will come with match practice and in the next three weeks i am looking forward to getting back to a certain level that is comparable to where i was in the past
6009657 since joining us as a trialist mark has proven to be an exceptional role model for not only the younger members of our playing group but also our senior players
6009658 whether i allow hits or i allow walks i always think that the important thing is not to allow the runners to score
6009659 thats the way i thought last year and its still the same this year i think id like to reach 15 wins every year if possible
6009660 he finds a way to win thats all you can ask from a starting pitcher
6009661 hes not giving in and we know that sometimes its frustrating but it keeps you on your toes

6009669 water intrusion is a major issue and its a reoccuring issue
6009670 thats a lot of peoples favorite solution but it turns out to be very expensive and you can actually make yourself worse off
6009671 i continue to be baffled as to why the sheriff should be held harmless and none of the commissions priorities and programs should be held harmless if we are going to spread that pain we should spread it across all constitutional officers
6009672 last year when we had those drastic cuts you got cut the least based upon last minute theatrics right here in this room the sheriff once again took less of the pain than anyone else
6009673 we did share some of the pain it was 3 2 million
6009674 you must think there is one heck of a slush fund over there to absorb these costs there is no extra room to cut we would have to cut people its been explained in here its not theatrics
6009675 i have said several times now that if the way to get this done was over several years i would be agreeable two would be an admirable goal
6009676 the commissions findings state that the lack of runway capacity is a main reason for what it calls the current poor standards of service and the lack of resilience at times of disruption which results in regular delays
6009677 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa the commission risks delaying
6009678 comprehensive report into the market power of the baa monopoly and fully endorse its findings
6009679 competition works monopolies dont baas monopoly control over the london airports has been highly detrimental to competition and consumers
6009680 baa has long ignored the needs of its airline users and the travelling public and provided inefficient gold plated facilities encouraged by an ineffectual regulator the civil aviation authority
6009681 focus must be on ensuring that the current regulation of baas london airports is strengthened
6009682 the competition commission has provisionally found that there are competition problems at each of baas seven uk airports heathrow gatwick stansted and southampton in england and edinburgh glasgow and aberdeen in scotland with adverse consequences for passengers and airlines
6009683 a principal cause is their common ownership by baa there are also competition problems arising from the planning system aspects of government policy and the system of regulation
6009684 the cc is now seeking views on which two of baas three london airports should be sold and similarly which of edinburgh or glasgow airports should be sold
6009685 beginning to walk but by no means were they running
6009686 if that was a u s brigade it would not have gone into combat
6009687 from what ive heard a lot of the 4th brigade was hit pretty hard
6009688 some of the soldiers seemed really grateful for the things we taught them
6009689 come from the hills of georgia and some of them sign for their paycheck with an x
6009690 overall goal is to bring georgia up to nato standards
6009691 i know specifically that bravo company im sure and i hope from what i did for them that theyre better off than they would have been if this happened four weeks ago
6009692 im not saying that were suffering here with the 1 million thread count sheets or checking out the local females at the pool
6009693 but if our job now is to sit here and put down roots in the couch id rather do it at home
6009694 last years le petit elegance represented an exciting and new type of fundraising event for breast cancer research when we talked with the american le mans drivers team owners and fans we realized that everyone regardless of age gender or interest is affected by breast cancer
6009695 not only does this annual event allow emory to connect with a new audience but thanks to the generosity of don and nancy panoz and the american le mans series family every dollar raised from le petit elegance 2008 will be used for breast cancer research at emory
6009696 not many chefs get to do this and i was lucky its a great team we have here
6009697 but then it was just because i was old enough to get a job
6009698 i got to cook at johns island club in florida wigwam in arizona and the american club in wisconsin
6009699 and this is just a few it was a great way to cook for fine resorts and learn regional cooking and well everything
6009700 you just have to love cooking to do this job
6009701 its a long day usually beginning at 7 a m and im here until 6 or 7 p m six days a week in summer
6009702 we try to make it very local and very seasonal
6009703 yesterday we had a haddock sandwich that was really popular
6009704 and keep it simple this is what we specialize in here
6009705 when we do go out i like sake in portsmouth
6009706 we have two young daughters so we like to get chinese takeaway i like asia in dover and china palace in rochester
6009707 keep it simple do what seems to work the best
6009708 when you mix too many ingredients together its just not going to come out as a clean tasting product
6009709 this is a great place for me now and i love it
6009710 i love that our kitchen has access to the customers a bit and our clientele are varied and appreciative it makes a big difference

6009743 international growth is one of our key strategic priorities and that includes boosting our ability to create programming for specific local audiences around the world
6009744 this acquisition will jump start our efforts in the very important uk market carnival has a great track record and we are excited about helping this first class operation become even more successful
6009745 carnival is a highly respected tv production operation and we are delighted to welcome them into the nbc universal fold
6009746 we feel this deal will prove an excellent strategic fit and present abundant international growth opportunities into the future
6009747 i am excited to bring the company into the global brand that is nbc universal under this groundbreaking deal which offers great strategic opportunities for carnival and all the talent who work with us
6009748 as a unique production model in the uk i believe we will have so much to bring to our broadcaster relationships and the creative community equally as a production base for nbc universal outside of north america we will be an important asset for our new parent
6009749 i dont need anti virus software ill just be careful id never fall for an internet phishing scam i can spot a bogus deal from a mile off
6009750 he felt like he had a layer of security but he probably never counted on a turtle with a tracking device leading us to that location and finding the field
6009751 maar alleen al het feit dat de commissaris een luisterend oor heeft is geweldig
6009752 hij wilde van alles weten bijvoorbeeld hoe de communicatie tussen gemeente en gebruikers is en hoe de financiering is geregeld we hebben hem natuurlijk verteld wat onze angst is dat het klinker verhaal een financieel debacle wordt in onze ogen hij heeft vier a4tjes volgeschreven
6009753 we hebben aangegeven dat de winschoter politiek nipt met zeven stemmen voor en zes tegen het plan heeft aangenomen
6009754 we have a duty to entertain if we can but i also have a duty to win games
6009755 weve been a bit loose defensively last year we had a good record and thats something we need to look at
6009756 weve got players who can provide some exciting football going forward but we have to get the balance right
6009757 greg abbott and i are a bit concerned about the fact that weve conceded four goals and weve been trying to put that to rights in training this week
6009758 were not always going to be able to get three or four goals each time we concede two so weve got to stop making that difficult for ourselves
6009759 but ive always said i will judge a striker on the days they dont score
6009760 the goals are obvious to see danny graham did a good job alongside danny carlton at bristol rovers and carlton did a good job alongside danny graham against crewe
6009761 im happy with that partnership and the players seem to be positive with it
6009762 muxtape will be unavailable for a brief period while we sort out a problem with the riaa
6009763 quite often august is our wettest month here three years ago wed cut half our wheat in july but then took the whole of august to finish and four years ago we didnt begin wheat until the august bank holiday
6009764 i also had 11 years farming in the scottish borders where we often didnt start wheat until september
6009765 it was a good yield and gave us a good crop of straw the suzuka went down a bit but it still yielded and ive sold all except 50t for feed at 130 t
6009766 but it was then all downhill and we ended up with our five year average
6009767 but that was more to do with fields than varieties we had two quite badly hit by pigeons i was very pleased with the grace
6009768 my biggest concern is for the hagberg in the soissons which has done very well at 3 4t acre adjusted to 15 moisture someones coming today to test what weve done so far its a nice sample with a bushel weight of 80kg hl
6009769 we started cutting last monday at 22 moisture and by saturday afternoon it was down to 16
6009770 but im a bit worried about the oakley sprouting so well probably cut that first opico mobile driers with gas burners ive been getting gas at 32p litre its definitely better value than diesel at the moment some years ago diesel was only half the price of gas
6009771 after an hour of upheaval the pilot announced they would take everybody and their cases but that we would have to defuel at newcastle and refuel at verona
6009772 we all had to go back to the departure lounge but once there the newcastle ground staff came and said either 70 people would have to remain with their cases or everybody goes with no luggage and it will be sent on
6009773 they said we had five minutes to decide as the cabin crew were nearly out of flying time
6009774 loyalty ought to be something the government earns through performance not through reciting a pledge
6009775 we argued that the hoa was not being reasonable in restricting smoking in our own unit nowhere on the premises not in the parking lot or on our patio
6009776 i dont know who saw what where his great great great great grandma ran over in the hood or something went down
6009777 thats not the only way but its certainly one way great great great great grandma pulled one of them studs up outta the barn come here for a second you know they go out and work in the yard you know back in the day something like that
6009778 during the slave period the slave owner would breed his big black with his big woman so that he would have a big black kid thats where it all started
6009779 men are being demonized in the media for a long time now i think probably this is just societys reaction they think wed better start tightening up on everything its getting to the stage when all men are viewed with distrust
6009780 it was only to teach my son a lesson hes been going through life doing things and getting away with it
6009781 were asking people if theyre going to have these fantasies please dont make it so public move these sexual fantasies to other professions
6009782 everybody is scared its not normal to not be scared
6009783 but im not scared as much now i have letters and other things from people telling me how ive helped so many people in numerous ways that makes me feel good
6009784 i just want to say thanks to the people for keeping me going
6009785 all them little cards and stuff i got keeps me going day by day to know im going downhill a little bit it doesnt bother me because ive helped so many people since ive helped so many people this is easier to handle
6009786 we would get things almost every day from people all over the country
6009787 people would sometimes call too just wanting to talk to him
6009788 some wanted to come meet him it was amazing i guess he touched so many people
6009789 there is just so much these days with the internet and web sites and blogs but this was a story about a kid who was just so real that it grabs you
6009790 i know pittsburgh is probably all concerned about what the steelers are going to be like this fall and how maybe the penguins couldve done things differently in the stanley cup but this kids story was just so different
6009791 the story that the post gazette did started the fire for this kid if maybe i threw another log on to help get it going more then great because it deserved to be a bonfire
6009792 you never know what life might bring you you might have a few sniffles and think its not a big thing then you go to the doctor the next day and they tell you that you have a 10 pound tumor in your stomach
6009793 it makes you realize how short life is and how unfair it can be
6009794 i think whats cool is that even with what he had he chose to make the best of it and touch a lot of lives that he wouldnt have if this hadnt happened to him he got the bad end of the deal but he touched a lot of people for sure he touched the 25 people in here
6009795 their manager joe maddon called and said he saw the story on john on espn and he was just in his hotel room in tears
6009796 he said he just wanted to meet john coach maddon has really become touched by john and his message
6009797 it was a good time because we both got to experience it and it felt like something not just for me but something he enjoyed as well
6009798 now john had no idea about these madonna and a rod rumors about an affair and john goes so wheres your wife i couldnt believe it but a rod just said she was in florida at their other home with their kids
6009799 then john asked him if his wife worked john wasnt trying to be smart he was just curious he told john that she didnt work but that she had a psychology degree
6009800 the first time she was here john said i know why youre here
6009801 his attitude and messages i think changed how some people looked at their lives he changed how i went about life
6009802 i feel like a piece of my heart is gone now the thing ill miss most is his smile he had a smile that could light up a room
6009803 if i can help someone else going through this then that would make me feel good
6009804 i could see people having some beers and hopefully remembering how i always tried my best no matter what i was doing thats my message just for people to always do their best no matter what theyre doing or how stupid it might seem and no matter what there will always be a reward no matter how small it is
6009805 i just love google theyre soooo cute and cuddly and adorable and awesome
6009806 i googled him on the well known website google com and he seems pretty interesting
6009807 to use the google search engine to find information about as a person on the world wide web
6009808 i googled him on yahoo and he seems pretty interesting
6009809 stingray still being attached to irwins bloodstained trademark khaki shirt
6009810 its a sad commentary about the level of fear in our society that a movie about a group of courageous entertainers who were blacklisted for exercising their right of free speech is now itself being blacklisted by corporate america the idea that anyone should be penalized for criticizing the president is sad and profoundly un american

6009892 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative

6009952 the idea was for virgin megastores to create something special that would garner attention and showcase the great films that warner bros has produced over the past 85 years
6009953 weve created the largest in store marketing design that weve ever done for a partner which includes a 40x20 foot in store billboard with an epson projection screen in the middle of it we have utilized a huge part of our times square megastore to help promote the anniversary of one of the top studios in the world its been a fantastic opportunity to work with a partner in such a creative large pop up store environment
6009954 virgin megastores have offered us a larger than life eye catching and interactive design to reintroduce great classics to a new generation of filmgoers
6009955 they came to us with this creative concept that truly will help us raise the visibility of our studios anniversary and the worlds largest library of film
6009956 that one might almost miss it to strip a statue of its color is actually to disfigure it
6009957 call them gaudy call them garish his scrupulous color reconstructions made their debut in 2003 at the glyptothek museum in munich which is devoted to greek and roman statuary
6009958 white marble has been the norm ever since the renaissance when classical antiquities first began to emerge from the earth
6009959 by the early 19th century the systematic excavation of ancient greek and roman sites was bringing forth great numbers of statues and there were scholars on hand to document the scattered traces of their multicolored surfaces
6009960 the whiter the body is the more beautiful it is as well
6009961 color contributes to beauty but it is not beauty color should have a minor part in the consideration of beauty because it is not color but structure that constitutes its essence
6009962 its reasonable to assume that the painting on the figures was at least as sophisticated as the figures themselves
6009963 the competition commissions findings should be assessed in the light of the urgent need for new airport capacity and a modern regulatory framework as well as the need which we recognise for improved service from the airport operator
6009964 the commissions findings state that the lack of runway capacity is a main reason for what it calls the current poor standards of service and the lack of resilience at times of disruption which results in regular delays
6009965 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa but also for a review of the governments air transport white paper the commission risks delaying that delivery of new runways and making better customer service less not more likely
6009966 we will be seeking urgent clarification from the government of how it believes this reports findings can be reconciled with the air transport policy it established in 2003 and its current review of economic regulation
6009967 we note that this is not the end of the competition commission process and we will continue to point out to the commission the many areas where we believe its analysis is flawed and its remedies would be disproportionate and counter productive
6009968 just as the government is about to make the decisions that could lead to the first full length runways being built in the south east since the second world war the commission risks creating uncertainty delay and confusion at exactly the wrong time
6009969 the commission report is what we have been waiting for an honest and unbiased assessment of our airports they have said what everyone knows that our airports arent working and that baa and regulation arent working
6009970 but lets not kid ourselves into thinking that the break up of baa will automatically result in a better deal for the travelling public simply selling a monopoly airport from one greedy highly indebted capitalist to another will benefit no one part from the dealmakers in the city
6009971 gatwick will be sold to the highest bidder who will probably be highly indebted like ferrovial and like ferrovial will be expecting uk consumers to pick up the bill
6009972 purpose renew confidence of the local populace that their lives are returning to normal
6009973 its really money well spent when you look at the thrill that its given these kids

6009981 working with itv2 through the acquisition of the us series and simultaneously working with them on the commission of the uk version has been remarkable
6009982 it speaks to the incredible international star power of paris hilton that we can engage a broadcaster such as itv2 in the commission of this format prior to the launch of the original programme
6009983 paris hilton is a worldwide phenomenon and itv2 is the perfect channel for her to make her first ever uk show prospective new best friends should form an orderly queue
6009984 this is an innovative way to take an exciting us format and bring it to world wide audiences
6009985 paris is an international star probably the best known personality in the world for her to do this show in the uk is a huge coup
6009986 this has been an amazing relationship i love her energy her wit and her drive to be the best in everything she does
6009987 a package of tailored business solutions that is based on analytics is essential if an enterprise is to retain customers namely an understanding of the customers intentions and analyzing the customer experience are often ignored as part of many crm initiatives but they cannot be avoided understanding and managing the customers intentions expectations and experience is the next generation in crm and providing such a package is a key element of achieving this goal
6009988 we are excited to announce the availability of our new packaged solutions to our customers the packages are based on extensive in market field work with tier 1 global companies that have been using our interaction analytics solution to solve critical business challenges with great success
6009989 lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity
6009990 while we accept that constraints on runway capacity in the south east will limit the scope for the benefits of competition in the short term we believe that separate owners would be more active than baa in exploiting existing opportunities
6009991 just as the government is about to make the decisions that could lead to the first full length runways being built in the south east since the second world war the commission risks creating uncertainty delay and confusion at exactly the wrong time
6009992 in scotland the commission has apparently ignored the evidence presented by baa and supported by numerous respected third party organisations that clearly demonstrates that serve separate markets and therefore do not and would not compete regardless of ownership
6009993 probably opening day and the opening day of deer season are about the only times i get butterflies

6009995 many service providers know that google apps exists and that it can assist their businesses but are unaware on how to effectively migrate thousands of customers into google apps without disruption
6009996 this is the issue we are solving for service organizations once their customers are migrated we tie their management system to google to automate customer administration tasks such as adds deletes suspends and password changes
6009997 we have spent the last quarter enhancing our unique provisioning platform
6009998 to date we have successfully migrated over 120 000 internet customers from numerous domains into google apps our technical expertise and 10 years of experience in assisting service organizations and affinity groups with internet solutions is what makes ikano very unique
6009999 a healthy demand environment and smooth execution led to strong revenue growth in the second quarter
