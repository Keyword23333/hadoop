8780000 i wasnt about to do this on my own but my wife finally made me check out some levitra online from your company a couple years ago its absolutely changed our life together your company is always prompt and professional and levitra works every time thank you
8780001 i dont need it all the time depending on how well i stay in shape and take care of myself but when i do need it levitra always works and your company has always treated me well and saved me the trouble of running all over town to get a prescription filled i cant see myself dealing with anyone but you
8780002 it gets hard sometimes yeah wed be lying if we said it didnt
8780003 but you try not to let years past affect year present its a different team than we had last year a different team than we had five years ago so you try to look at it that way
8780004 that is something i have tried to pay close attention to because it has been an issue consistently enough where it is not just bad luck
8780005 i dont know there is one specific reason because each year there has probably been something different
8780006 one year we didnt hit one year we didnt pitch one year we got hurt it could be all sorts of different reasons but i would say the two main ones would be depth and scheduling
8780007 we are going to play no matter what but i think there is something to be said for every pitch every out means something something even more than for us probably
8780008 not that we take anything lightly or for granted i dont want that to come across that way and i dont think anybody would see it that way its just the nature of sports
8780009 a lot of these guys who were here last year are back this year
8780010 i think last year a lot of guys had a hard time mentally preparing themselves for games or for coming to the park its not that you dont give your all its more of a mental thing than anything i think the guys who were here last year no one wants to go through that again
8780011 guys are aware what has happened around here and are doing everything they can to not only to make it better but to make it as best as it possibly can be
8780012 you just try to build up the depth in the areas that are going to be the most meaningful when you are making that finishing kick for the season
8780013 that means hes going to be coming out of a

8780016 what do you need to be the best concentration discipline most of all a dream
8780017 wars and elections are both too big and too small to matter in the long run the daily work that goes on it adds up
8780018 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8780019 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8780020 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8780021 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8780022 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8780023 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8780024 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8780025 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8780026 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8780027 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8780028 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8780029 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done

8780031 i have a much higher i q than you do
8780032 i have a much higher i q than you do
8780033 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed i live like a recluse no one knows i exist
8780034 i have a much higher i q than you do
8780035 people of every creed and colour from every walk of life
8780036 is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8780037 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8780038 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8780039 i get it i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
8780040 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8780041 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8780042 america we are better than these eight years we are a better country than this
8780043 im all for efficiency the problem is no one in management has come and spoken to me or my immediate boss about how we can achieve that
8780044 it has just been this blanket email go out and what that causes is hysteria and for people to be scared
8780045 we dont want to see a media thats being able to be stood over by big business or the government
8780046 comcast has confirmed that all residential customers will be subject to a
8780047 in australia we pay 500 a day for 10 mb up and down transfer you should be happy with the restrictions your isp is placing on you
8780048 i just wanted to thank you your mention of hdhomerun was the first time i had seen a box which can handle qam signals had i heard about this a month ago i might be using it right now instead of the box from cox
8780049 off topic and bizarrely ungrammatical comments made by people with nothing to say who adopt a disgruntled pose in an attempt to appear experienced but who merely succeed in making themselves look humorless and confused
8780050 who write that stupid code hmm let me see the subversion oopps its me
8780051 but as technology closes more gaps so this evolving threat is never going away the reliance more and more on you people and your experience and your expertise and your professionalism becomes more and more a factor
8780052 its a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect
8780053 now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world class education because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy michelle and i are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education and i will not settle for an america where some kids dont have that chance
8780054 individual responsibility and mutual responsibility thats the essence of americas promise
8780055 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are here to restore that legacy
8780056 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8780057 hey thats the black guy who almost got to be president
8780058 this guy is going to be the first great president weve had in a long time
8780059 some of them are reading now yep so i would like to see them reading wll so they can go into second grade and working together as a class
8780060 among the most professional creative and progressive police officers employed by any city in the united states
8780061 despite a city and county criminal justice system that is strained by shrinking county resources poor coordination and redundancy in a fractured criminal justice system
8780062 i have prepared a snapshot of the state of the portland police bureau and a series of recommendations designed to deliver a sustainable framework to ensure that front line officers receive the support they need to do their jobs
8780063 has been diluted after many years and varying degrees of commitment by subsequent leadership in the police bureau
8780064 results in a decision making process that lacks street officer input and an
8780065 over years of discussion little progress has been made in establishing common ground between the two sides on this issue
8780066 even the perception of racial profiling is a problem for the city
8780067 involves a limited amount of input from either the community or front line staff from within the bureau
8780068 this is in part due to the tradition of police bureau leadership emerging from the ranks with little or no formal exposure to public budgeting
8780069 they could be separated from and protected from their pimps and then diverted into specific treatment programs to begin the process of breaking down the cycle of prostitution
8780070 the police bureau was sharing information with the mayor to give a response i understand he is in the process of doing that the chiefs feedback will be wrapped into the mayors response
8780071 overall i am concerned with the tone and depth of any report that makes such sweeping statements about a number of important issues including such difficult to quantify issues as morale
8780072 are at odds with the recommendations of the sub committees that assisted preparing in the report and that committee notes seem to indicate that certain findings were requested or assumed before any research began
8780073 first you have to know with no fear that someday you are going to die until you know that you are useless
8780074 the mccain campaign is hoping to have 15 000 people at the ohio rally roughly five times the size of his largest crowd to date
8780075 i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character

8780077 how we think about licenses is getting a bit more nuanced
8780078 eclipse is an important lively and healthy project with an enormous plug in and developer community that uses an otherwise duplicative license they arent interested in using the bsd or other open source licenses that are readily combinable with epl code
8780079 we have decided that after nearly 2 years of operation that it was time to add the epl and serve these open source developers
8780080 like the time in denver when alex jones blah blah blah etc etc etc
8780081 even if we planned to name a starter we couldnt right now
8780082 let me be very clear you are the ones who built this campaign and barack wants you to be the first to know who will join him in leading our movement for change
8780083 the inadequacy of the sms technical infrastructure to support large scale marketing campaigns
8780084 it sends the chill bumps because you cant help but be ignited excited and delighted that this is happening
8780085 i think dr king would be smiling from ear to ear but i think there would be a sober reflection a sober moment bring to mind the suffering and the blood that had been shed in order to get there
8780086 the mere fact that we are having this conversation suggests how far we have to go
8780087 it is the best that the ankle has felt since i injured it
8780088 the last time we play the red sox in this yankee stadium and the battles weve been through this should end like this
8780089 no one likes to deal with the losing and were losing right now and we feel were better than this but at some point you are what your record is until you prove otherwise
8780090 we havent performed the bottom line is were not getting what we need to from everybody that we expected
8780091 theres been blowouts theres been close games weve won close games weve lost
8780092 theres been some heartbreaking moments and theres been some pretty joyful moments
8780093 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8780094 just shows us where we need to direct our disaster preparedness effort
8780095 the findings in this report will aid public health and emergency preparedness efforts and may help reduce the mortality burden in future natural disasters
8780096 section ill bet you didnt know that an enormous collection of cropped off pics of female olympic athlete a es qualified as satire these days
8780097 on your way out dont let the door bang you on the ass
8780098 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8780099 i came across two little black marsh fly puparia and kept them in jam jars on my desk expecting that adult marsh flies might hatch but what emerged were two different species of parasitic wasp
8780100 when we finally discovered that one of these insects had never been recorded before the question then was what to call this creature
8780101 after resisting the temptation to name it after someone i know who really wants to be named after a parasite we settled on naming it mesoleptus hibernica in honour of the country where it was discovered
8780102 pad will take total responsibility for security at government house so we have asked all police to handover to us
8780103 there are no longer any police inside and senior police will today meet to respond to this action
8780104 because of the over the top charges especially the charge of treason
8780105 wir treffen uns in einem entscheidenden moment einem moment in dem sich unser land im krieg befindet unsere wirtschaft in aufruhr ist und das amerikanische versprechen wieder einmal bedroht ist
8780106 amerika wir sind besser als in diesen letzten acht jahren wir sind ein besseres land als dieses
8780107 am 4 november m ssen wir aufstehen und sagen acht sind genug
8780108 in den vergangenen jahren ist diese krankheit wieder h ufiger geworden die tendenz ist steigend wohl auch bedingt durch verst rkten reisetourismus
8780109 die bertragung erfolgt ber eine tr pfcheninfektion haupts chlich durch anhusten eine bertragung durch gegenst nde ist nicht m glich
8780110 der fall soll nicht bertrieben aber auch nicht verharmlost werden wir nehmen das nicht auf die leichte schulter
8780111 an examination of first love family dynamics and the american dream

8780118 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8780119 but if there is serious injury you are to take life for life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot burn for burn wound for wound bruise for bruise
8780120 clearly you are a letter from christ prepared by us it is written not with pen and ink but with the spirit of the living god it is carved not on stone but on human hearts
8780121 who you are is so strong that i cannot hear a word you are saying
8780122 preach the gospel at all times use words only when necessary
8780123 why am i discouraged why so sad i will put my hope in god i will praise him again my savior and my god
8780124 blessed are those who are generous because they feed the poor
8780125 god was punishing him as such job was severely criticized as being a liar when he said he loved god
8780126 the lord the lord god merciful and gracious longsuffering and abounding in goodness and truth 7 keeping mercy for thousands forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin by no means clearing the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and the childrens children to the third and the fourth generation
8780127 merciful and gracious longsuffering and abounding in goodness and truth keeping mercy for thousands forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin
8780128 it was possible for four generations to live around the aged head of the family because of the close ties of a patriarchal family the influence of the patriarch good or evil affected all generations under his control
8780129 it is in prayer in the exercise of the faith that i have in fellowship with the living god that faith can increase faith can only live by feeding on what is divine on god himself
8780130 if you even you had only known on this day what would bring you peace but now it is hidden from your eyes
8780131 israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the gentiles has come in
8780132 now the lord is the spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is freedom
8780133 those who make them will be like them and so will all who trust in them
8780134 if only i had someone who would listen to me and try to see my side
8780135 you have said it in my hearing i have heard your very words
8780136 clearly you are a letter from christ prepared by us it is written not with pen and ink but with the spirit of the living god it is carved not on stone but on human hearts
8780137 why am i discouraged why so sad i will put my hope in god i will praise him again my savior and my god
8780138 lord i give up my mind for your mind my thoughts for your thoughts my way for your way my will for your way
8780139 and starting monday all of my friends are going to appear on television
8780140 when john mccain was sitting in a prison in hanoi bill clinton was writing letters to his rotc
8780141 go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet twenty first century challenges with a 20th century bureaucracy
8780142 it should help us not hurt us it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every american whos willing to work
8780143 yes government must lead on energy independence but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient
8780144 yes we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair but we must also admit that programs alone cant replace parents that government cant turn off the television and make a child do her homework that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need
8780145 i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8780146 because if you need two gos to get it to that stage well i think my kids could come up with a better design than that in one afternoon
8780147 i think that the intent was to have more turnover and certainly it has done that
8780148 i dont feel as though the season the regular season has anywhere near the same impact that it had and so that could be a good thing because now we dont have to play as many events if we dont want to
8780149 if the greens were fine we wouldnt be doing this work
8780150 but since were doing this work we think it will be a better course
8780151 even if they were to move the green back to exactly what it used to be we could do it
8780152 i think the usga just made a mistake in 98 putting the hole there if we meet somewhere in the middle on the slope we can have that green the same speed as the others
8780153 but two short par 3s just doesnt work in this day and age
8780154 i am currently looking to replace my desktop pc with a high spec laptop portability isnt a concern as it will spend most of its life on a desk here are a couple of things i am looking for biggest screen possible plenty of hdd space plenty of ram and plenty of ghzs cheaper is better but my budget is up to around 3 000
8780155 portability isnt a concern as it will spend most of its life on a desk
8780156 saturday and sunday is when it really turns into something really neat the whole fairgrounds comes alive i term it as the largest motorsport event in the upper midwest its just going to be a great event minot will be flowing with cars and people around it should be just wonderful
8780157 we believe that into the period of 2009 youll start to see economic growth picking up
8780158 if you go with the forecasts which were released by the reserve bank in august you see growth by the june quarter 2009 improving to two and a quarter and then by the end of next year to two and a half
8780159 id much rather be up front about that with the australian people rather than pretending that its any different
8780160 its a big challenge and its been a big challenge frankly since day one
8780161 australia is not immune to whats going on around the world the key thing is what youre doing about it and our plan in response to that is to first of all make sure that we dont put further upwards pressure on inflation interest rates thats our 22 billion surplus
8780162 secondly to make sure were investing in the countrys long term productivity growth thats what were talking about the eduction revolution
8780163 thats the third part of our economic strategy for the future but its going to be tough i dont want to mislead people
8780164 det h rer ingen steder hjemme at gennemf re s danne aktioner
8780165 vi har efter min mening ikke politisk tv i danmark
8780166 jag blev fruktansv rt uppr rd n r jag s g flaggan den r en v ldig provokation h nger man ut en svensk flagga p det s ttet ovanf r flyktingfamiljens l genhet s finns det en inneb rd i det s ger thord wid n fastighetsf rvaltare hos br cke kommun i huset d r flyktingfamiljen noori bodde finns 29 l genheter
8780167 kommunens tolkassistent kristian guzman blir verraskad n r p ber ttar om flaggan p balkongen oj den har jag inte sett
8780168 go to work send your kids to school follow fashion act normal walk on the pavements watch t v save for your old age obey the law repeat after me i am free
8780169 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8780170 we are very excited to add these five players to our roster in addition to the players we signed last fall
8780171 this is a very big class with nine true freshmen a sophomore transfer and a junior transfer with the nine returnees we have back we feel like we have assembled a team that will compete for a conference championships and an ncaa regional berth
8780172 emily will bring a year of division i experience to the mound as well as at the plate
8780173 she played at creighton and got great experience playing in the missouri valley conference emily can swing the bat and play first base as well we are excited she is here and we are looking forward to watching her play
8780174 kristin is a hard hitting catcher that will come in and make an immediate impact on our program
8780175 kristin has the ability to change a game anytime she is at the plate and as a catcher she has a great arm and runs the defense well behind the plate
8780176 she has two years of experience playing in the big 12 conference with oklahoma state and we look for her to come in and add leadership and power to our lineup
8780177 jordan is a catcher that hits for power and can also play the corners
8780178 she is a strong kid that loves to play the game she will add some power to our lineup and will be able to play several different positions we like her versatility
8780179 samantha is a power hitter that can play both corners and can pitch if needed
8780180 she swings a big stick and we look for her to add power to our lineup as well
8780181 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8780182 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000
8780183 john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies all over again
8780184 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man
8780185 if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8780186 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve experienced in the history of humankind
8780187 not only in the heat of this election but in the aftermath as we put his agenda to work for our country
8780188 has taught him something that career politicians often overlook that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance
8780189 the fact that we can come out here and sit on her bench
8780190 it feels like there is a piece of her thats back with us
8780191 never forget never forget and sadly a lot of americans have forgotten what happened 7 years ago
8780192 i think that soon students know that we may have a barack obama hall on howard university campus
8780193 it shows that no matter your creed your color or anything you have an opportunity to make it here in america
8780194 it shows that the sacrifices of those who have come before us have certainly not gone in vain
8780195 i got phone calls all through the night from people with whom we worked in this movement in africa in the middle east in latin america saying really put me on that love train
8780196 im just so pleased that we have this excitement not only here but around the world
8780197 we had been searching 40 years for a generation of technically competent and spiritually mature young people who would o on their watch what we did on ours
8780198 i think hes going to surprise everyone hes constantly consistently done very very well
8780199 this is going to be his major speech that brings it all together to say this is why you should vote for senator obama
8780200 the bar has certainly been set so i wish him good luck
8780201 the work currently being performed to finalise the full year result and prior period adjustments arising out of a re assessment of accounting treatments is substantially concluded and will be finalised as soon as possible
8780202 parents should feel reassured that current events have no effect on the day to day running of our centres
8780203 we appreciate the significant role our services play in the lives of all of our families and the provision of a safe educational and fun environment for the children remains our number one priority
8780204 a dion government would sit down with the provincial government and engage both the government of nova scotia and nova scotia power in a constructive discussion on how to help nova scotia make the green shift and we would invest in it
8780205 this is really what i would call quite predictable from mr brison he states a position then it changes he pouts and then he goes personal and attacks people as hes doing now with the premier
8780206 as australias largest home loan provider it makes good strategic sense to look at alternative investments in this industry that will continue to bring benefits to shareholders and consumers
8780207 the australian mortgage and housing industries are the backbone of the economy and the purchase of a home remains the largest single investment made by many consumers
8780208 as this market continues to develop a strategic investment in one of the market leading providers in this industry is a natural fit for the group
8780209 the work currently being performed to finalise the full year results and prior period adjustments arising out of a reassessment of accounting treatments is substantially concluded
8780210 that gdp surprised on the upside the market wasnt expecting that
8780211 there was some rebound in the us dollar coupled with oil dropping that added to the sell off in the aussie
8780212 current economic turbulence and changes reinforce the importance of continued investment in our brands experience of our management and sound fiscal management
8780213 within the 2009 financial year a minimum of 15 new complexes for our brands will open

8780222 i have a clause in my contract that states that when it comes to physicality that i have the right to veto with creative anything that i dont feel is safe that is warranted or anything else
8780223 for instance while john cena was filming the upcoming feature 12 rounds he was out for three months and business was excellent
8780224 i think the key point to be made here is that every one of these people signed contracts acknowledging they were independent contractors they contractually agreed that they would take care of their own health benefits and all the rest of that stuff the irs has never challenged the treatment of our wrestlers and they have audited the company several times
8780225 this lawsuit kind of came out of the blue in one sense but levy threatened us years ago and i think i know who is really behind the whole thing
8780226 none of these things make them an employee wrestlers are not like normal office workers they dont go to the corporate headquarters and they dont have any corporate duties their basic duty is to show up and perform as a highly skilled professional thats what theyre paid to do as far as i know in the entire history of the wrestling business wrestlers have always been treated as independent contractors theyre free to sign a contract like everybody is and free not to sign a contract like everybody is when those contracts are over they are free to go wherever they want to and they do they go to tna and they went wcw

8780237 i didnt know what to expect coming out of the break but weve had great energy in practice the last three days since i got back from china
8780238 were sending a message to people that its time to get down to business
8780239 its nice to have it but it wasnt a focus coming in
8780240 we can either get better or we could fold our tents
8780241 everyone gets whipped during the season at some point and we got ours tonight
8780242 i was a little tired in the first half and couldnt get in the groove
8780243 i got going after my first shot in the second half thats when everything got flowing for me
8780244 our turnovers we only had 10 assists and not knocking down shots was the telltale story for us
8780245 we wanted to limit their touches and strengths and make them play our game
8780246 shes such a big target in the paint we did not want her to post up that deep
8780247 it is always a great game with the new york liberty
8780248 it looked like a game that everyone had a month off
8780249 to me the layoffs are not an excuse we just didnt play well
8780250 we just turned the ball over too much thats a key stat
8780251 she was walking she was weight bearing and she did a little bit of rehab
8780252 we think its a great idea because this intersection sees 100 000 pedestrians a day
8780253 this will increase effectiveness and give a greater priority to pedestrians it will make crossing the street faster more efficient and safer for pedestrians
8780254 ive seen this before in washington dc 15 to 20 years ago
8780255 crisscrossing diagonally both ways somebodys got to give way or theyll collide
8780256 theres too many lights for a driver to look at theres already too many lights to begin with at this intersection with all the flashing ads
8780257 its crazy but its awesome it reminds me of some parts of paris or new york where people are just walking everywhere
8780258 i think its good because you dont have to waste your time crossing twice
8780259 what difference will one minute really make in your life
8780260 i think its stupid because its not busy enough for a crisscross and its worse for traffic
8780261 its definitely better for pedestrians but its not needed it might save you a minute
8780262 this is one of the few unique places in toronto where pedestrians are number one
8780263 altough theres also an additional 28 seconds for cars allowing them 80 seconds instead of 60
8780264 we waited and crossed the old way because it was easier
8780265 once you get the rhythm of it it makes sense but i didnt want to take the chance
8780266 walk sign is on for all crossing walk sign is on for all crossing
8780267 any time the city can do something to enhance public or pedestrian safety its a step in the right direction
8780268 barnes made the people so happy theyre dancing in the streets

8780277 abortion and euthanasia have become preeminent threats to human life and dignity because they directly attack life itself the most fundamental good and the condition of all others abortion the deliberate killing of a human being before birth is never morally acceptable and must always be opposed
8780278 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to undermine that right the democratic party also strongly supports access to affordable family planning services and comprehensive age appropriate sex education which empower people to make informed choices and live healthy lives we also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby reduce the need for abortions the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
8780279 and senator st augustine said three months we dont know the point is it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
8780280 grave moral evil the churchs moral teaching never justified or permitted abortion at any stage of development
8780281 that is why the enforcement operation is in progress to help reinforce that
8780282 that is not safe to have a little one crossing that street reedy creek road
8780283 its the first down and were on the one yard line
8780284 just because im brown doesnt mean that i wont bomb the shit out of other brown people
8780285 the answer the future depends on who the we is
8780286 if people conceptualise this anti war as a left movement then you automatically cut yourself off from 65 of the 70 percent of people who oppose the war
8780287 we need organisations willing to take on a focus on skills building you talk about the campaign planning tool power mapping for a campaign and some people have no idea what that is
8780288 its the same people running the meetings or the same people are part of a few overlapping organisations there are no stepping stones no mentorship no room to grow into involvement
8780289 sometimes if you work with one group you risk alienating a wing of your organisational core
8780290 i feel great but whether they let me kick or not is up to them
8780291 i feel like i could do it but feeling it and doing it are two different things i havent touched a ball in three weeks
8780292 of course they had to take about 30 x rays
8780293 by the time i got out of the x ray room i was fine

8780295 no person is too big or too small to accomplish something
8780296 that i can succeed in my dreams if i try my best
8780297 that same kid said when obama defeated hillary good so i have a chance so i can become the first woman president
8780298 i want to hear him talk about how far weve come as a country because it seems theyre really not trying to make race a big issue but its a big deal
8780299 i want to hear an inspirational speech with some specifics to get his critics off his back so we can move forward and he gets a bump in the polls and hopefully hell go on to become president
8780300 he could stop the war he could do a lot of things
8780301 he should probably address the economy mostly because gas is a lot of money its a lot of things and the gas tax is just going to keep rising and rising
8780302 chamllionaire the horror flick x go hard x the greatest x roll call reloaded
8780303 john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8780304 he said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong
8780305 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8780306 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8780307 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8780308 and today as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration even after we learned that iraq has a 79 billion surplus while were wallowing in deficits john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8780309 if john mccain wants to follow george bush with more tough talk and bad strategy that is his choice but it is not the change we need
8780310 how good is carolyn bivens grasp of the game and business she is charged with running
8780311 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it its a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create american jobs look out for american workers and play by the rules of the road i will make certain those health care companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws so that your pensions are protected ahead of ceo bonuses

8780362 station owners have to value whats in their tanks based on what the replacement costs are whats it going to cost them to buy off the rack basically
8780363 so when that price goes up theyre going to start raising the price at the pump although its usually a short term thing

8780387 to me theres not a better quarterback in the nfc i really believe that
8780388 when the play breaks down or doesnt go exactly according to plan we wanted to make sure he doesnt panic and that he makes a good decision even if its throwing the ball away
8780389 last year he might have thrown it up for grabs now hes moving around in the pocket and looking for another chance
8780390 looking back at that occurrence for the first and last time it was a missed call
8780391 and it was not because doug eddings an umpire with 10 years experience and 10 before that in the minor leagues didnt know the application of the rule but just that in the moment in applying the rule he saw something he thought was more than it turned out to be
8780392 he raced at a time when racing was extremely dangerous and got through it all without a serious injury
8780393 he had an extraordinary mechanical sense he was very much in tune with the car
8780394 i as well as all employees of ferrari are extremely saddened by the news of the passing of phil hill a man and a champion who gave so much to ferrari
8780395 phil and i have always kept in touch throughout the years and i know i will miss his passion and love for ferrari very much
8780396 and he knew it off the top of his head he was extremely intelligent and well rounded he was an opera expert and very well read he was very sophisticated
8780397 phil was a very special guy and had a love for the automotive age
8780398 he was always a potential winner when he sat in a race car he was both a competitor and a close friend and a fellow i could look up to
8780399 every time he touches the ball he has a chance to score
8780400 i have more experience out there i know more and im confident
8780401 he knows what to do in blitz coverages he and i are definitely on the same page so were excited about that
8780402 hes a great playmaker for us its all about getting the ball in his hands as many different ways as we can whether its handing him the ball throwing screens throwing downfield hell go get it
8780403 theyve all shown me they can kick in the big ten and win for us
8780404 we win eight of 10 games but you really dont know why
8780405 you have to show you can win everything so when it comes to the postseason you can win
8780406 you want to win the series but there are more games you have to win i think were getting there
8780407 now that were in the middle of everything i havent even thought about it i never thought of myself as a quick fix when i got traded here from the angels anything can happen theres still a lot of time we have to see where were going and where we stand at the end of the season
8780408 you have to get on base and let the other guys drive you in you have to bunt you have to move people over its all the same thing im really comfortable i dont see it like a challenge every day
8780409 before it was in my head it was a challenge
8780410 i was asked that question specifically after the sweep and i said they arent going anywhere
8780411 it reminds me of 1978 when i played on a yankees team that swept boston on controversial columnist jay mariotti resigns from chicago sun times
8780412 ich akzeptiere die nominierung zum pr sidentschaftskandidaten in tiefer dankbarkeit und gro er bescheidenheit

8780418 after this long campaign so many of us know this man
8780419 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know why else would he define middle class as someone making under five million dollars a year
8780420 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8780421 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8780422 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8780423 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
8780424 i love this country and so do you john mccain the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first

8780429 he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8780430 we should be able to agree that everyone should be able to visit their loved ones in the hospital and live their lives free from something i got a head rush at this point
8780431 if john mccain wants to argue about who has the temperament and the judgement to be commander in chief that is an argument i welcome
8780432 he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives

8780457 an open content distribution system that will help end users find purchase download and install various types of content on their android powered devices
8780458 we chose the term market rather than store because we feel that developers should have an open and unobstructed environment to make their content available
8780459 content can debut in the marketplace after only three simple steps register as a merchant upload and describe your content and publish it we also intend to provide developers with a useful dashboard and analytics to help drive their business and ultimately improve their offerings

8780465 while there is no disguising the seriousness of the situation for the centro group we are making incremental steps towards stabilisation in a difficult environment centro chief executive glenn rufran said
8780466 our fundamental task remains to secure long term debt restructuring and we will continue to work with our lending groups to achieve this goal
8780467 maintaining the underlying value of the business has been a major focus of the management team mr rufran said
8780468 the headline loss of 2055 million does not reflect the operating performance of the group for the past financial year
8780469 after adding back the above items to the headline result the underlying earnings are 242 million
8780470 our tenants are heavily weighted toward necessity orientated retailers such as supermarkets and discount stores and it is these retailers that continue to perform solidly when economic conditions start to slow mr rufrano said
8780471 the level of development activity has slowed with the current development program being 194 million centro said
8780472 this new business model means allco will be a fiduciary manager of investment funds in aviation shipping and private equity he said
8780473 we will cease our principal investment activities sell remaining non core assets and in the future only use the balance sheet to co invest in our managed funds
8780474 this new structure is a major departure from our previous operations in which the group was heavily reliant on debt and as a result was exposed to the global credit crisis and deteriorating financial markets mr clarke said
8780475 with its previous complex structure allco had entered some non core businesses that were dependent on the ongoing availability of corporate funding
8780476 they were either unprofitable in the new economic environment or required significant capital to achieve profitable scale he said
8780477 we have determined that capital is better deployed in our three core asset classes which fit our funds management model
8780478 unfortunately this has required the departure of many talented employees to date and will see a further reduction in headcount by up to 50 per cent by the end of june 2009 as we accelerate our restructuring program he said
8780479 the reconstruction of the group is progressing however the business remains in a fragile position and the continued market weakness is making the task difficult mr clarke said
8780480 we are committed to creating a leaner and simpler to understand company with realistic growth opportunities
8780481 we plan to continue to diversify and broaden our fleet with greater exposure to the growth segments particularly in high margin niche areas like lpg and offshore supply mr clarke said
8780482 the work currently being performed to finalise the full year results and prior period adjustments arising out of a reassessment of accounting treatments is substantially concluded the company said
8780483 we had the us market up with the trifecta of indexes all up over one per cent he said
8780484 working with nsquared ensures that cxc will have a huge technology advantage over any potential competitors

8780494 what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
8780495 that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
8780496 in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is youre on your own
8780497 out of work tough luck no health care the market will fix it born into poverty pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you dont have boots youre on your own
8780498 protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education
8780499 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution
8780500 we will keep our promise to every young american if you commit to serving your community or your country we will make sure you can afford a college education
8780501 i want my daughters to have the exact same opportunities as your sons
8780502 its time for us to change america and thats why im running for president
8780503 we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight
8780504 what does it say about your judgment when you think has been right more than 90 percent of the time
8780505 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8780506 who made a case for change as only he can make it
8780507 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8780508 one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8780509 has the good judgement to know that we should not risk the lives of our brave soldiers in the wrong war
8780510 like another son of illinois he has spoken to a divided people about the better angeles of our nature
8780511 when we talk about an open convention this is what democrats meant
8780512 were here for the millions of americans whove been knocked down to show that were going to get back up as a nation
8780513 youll be happy to know that im looking forward to voting for barack obama in november
8780514 so i learned at an early age to value freedom and the ideals of american
8780515 we shall nobly save or meanly lose the last best hope of the earth
8780516 let us restore the hope and bring the change that our nation needs
8780517 our cohesiveness as a nation is strained by multiple crises in finance and credit energy and health care
8780518 on the killing fields of picketts charge our country came of age and assured for all time that our nation would survive as one
8780519 after they wrecked our economy its time for a change
8780520 after they abandoned the search for the terrorists who attacked us and redeployed the troops to invade a nation that did not attack us its time for a change
8780521 powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
8780522 it is that common which barack obama exemplifies heart and soul that enables us as americans to speak with moral authority to all of the people of the world
8780523 the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8780524 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
8780525 sea levels are rising fires are raging storms are stronger
8780526 take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him
8780527 we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families and we would not be denying the wed be solving it
8780528 barack obama and joe biden believe we must fight the terrorists not where we imagine them to be but where we know them to be
8780529 we must lead a global effort to secure loose nuclear materials not where we imagine them to be but where we know them to be
8780530 i have a question for you is anybody here going to miss dick cheney
8780531 to put american workers first and rebuild the middle class with a president who supports unions and the rights of workers to organize
8780532 my fellow delegates are you ready to take our country back lets do it
8780533 strive for better schools economic justice and smarter foreign policies
8780534 arent we all tired of a washington that doesnt have any faith in us
8780535 we need to put our faith into action to elect a president who will put middle class americans first again
8780536 its fitting that the change we need in washington starts here in the rocky mountain west we look to our mountains and prairies our wide open skies and we see the limitless possibility that is america
8780537 we will march as we never have before to elect the next sen barack obama
8780538 on this day exactly 45 years ago my father stood on the national mall in the shadow of and proclaimed i have a dream
8780539 you know we are all children of the dream and he is here in all of our hearts and minds
8780540 let us give our nation a leader who has heard this clarion call and will help us achieve the change we still need
8780541 on that day his words and his example inspired an entire generation of young and old rich and poor
8780542 for the past eight years weve had two oilmen in the white house and where has it gotten us
8780543 record prices at the gas pump heating oil costs going through the roof oil companies reaping record profits while american families struggle to put gas in the tank
8780544 i say solar here solar now wind here wind now
8780545 we need to stop paying lip service to health care reform and just pass it we need to protect a womens right to choose and access to affordable family planning and health care and we need to bring our troops home
8780546 we say today we will not be satisfied with four more years of the same under
8780547 we need to stop talking about ending the and just do it
8780548 if god doesnt live in colorado ill bet thats where he spends most of his time
8780549 its about a set of american ideals that offer hope and unity and the promise of change
8780550 its about binding people together with common goals shared visions and the pioneering spirit that defines all of america
8780551 were thrilled to have this magnificent crowd here with us tonight
8780552 in america great leaders have always seized the chance for change
8780553 tonight no matter where you come from or the language you speak i am asking you elect barack obama president because he will fight for us
8780554 down to earth knows more about foreign policy than anybody else in the senate
8780555 this is the last one ill be able to go to i feel all right i woke up breathing this morning
8780556 we want to get the whole experience of the whole day this is a minor inconvenience
8780557 we knew it was going to take a while but we didnt think it would be this long
8780558 everythings good real peaceful protesters are following what they said they would do
8780559 its not just about the last 7 years its about moving forward resuming our role in world leadership
8780560 i want the sun the waiting in line the whole experience im standing in line for my grandchildren
8780561 im 77 been waiting all my life for this so standing in line here doesnt bother me at all
8780562 that theres peace here harmony and order and that whats going on here radiates
8780563 this isnt like just a football game its a historical moment something you can take to your grave knowing you were part of history
8780564 millimeter wave technology another form of body imaging technology uses non ionizing electromagnetic waves to generate an image based on the energy reflected from the body
8780565 creates an image that looks like a chalk outline of the passenger with threats outlined but does not reveal facial features
8780566 the smartcheck systems installed at jfk lax and phoenix sky harbor cannot store export print or transmit images
8780567 to date approximately 90 percent of passengers have opted for screening using smartcheck rather than undergoing a pat down
8780568 millimeter wave technology pinpoints objects made of any material including liquids rubber wire plastic and metal to quickly and easily locate weapons contraband and other threats concealed under an individuals clothing
8780569 the portals detect concealed and hidden objects such as metallic and non metallic weapons and virtually all known explosives and other contraband in seconds
8780570 the images generated through millimeter wave are lower resolution than that of x ray backscatter and as a result privacy may be less of a concern for the traveling public
8780571 first this technology produces strikingly graphic images of passengers bodies those images reveal not only our private body parts but also intimate medical details like colostomy bags that degree of examination amounts to a significant and for some people humiliating assault on the essential dignity of passengers that citizens in a free nation should not have to tolerate
8780572 second we question the supposed voluntary nature of this scan tsas assumption that the people who
8780573 is equal to 15 minutes of exposure to natural background radiation on a sunny day

8780578 the fracture and reservoir diagnostics business has been a high growth business for us and we believe the future potential of this business is reflected in the value we received for these assets
8780579 we recently announced a 21 percent increase in our quarterly dividend the approval of a 70 million capacity expansion at our facility in toomsboro georgia and now the authorization to repurchase up to 2 0 million shares of the companys common stock these actions clearly demonstrate our confidence in our ability to grow our business and generate cash
8780580 the inability to compel the attendance of the witnesses is a serious if not fatal blow to the defense in the removal proceedings
8780581 youll have to do the best you can we dont have subpoena power theres no argument about that
8780582 i dont have the time to write three to four blog posts a week
8780583 i have clients that demand my attention i feel like i will be left out in the cold if i ignore a network for a couple of days
8780584 instead of being african american we can be american now
8780585 this is a civil rights moment that gives us the groundwork for whats to come
8780586 most people who have a sense of history think hes going to invoke the memory of martin luther king
8780587 a lot of us who can remember those incidents will look at obamas acceptance of the nomination as a deciding moment for the country
8780588 african americans are looking at this in a historical context and realizing the great strides were making
8780589 we all have biases no one could truthfully say otherwise but as in any profession if you are good at what you do and take your job seriously you check your biases at the door no matter whether you are black or white
8780590 to me saying all african american journalists think alike is just as insulting if not more so than saying they all look alike
8780591 i believe in his ideals and his proposals to lead this nation
8780592 the cbcf applauds reg weavers long standing commitment to improving the u s education system
8780593 he has been a passionate advocate for quality education and for providing solutions to problems that plague inner city and other schools that serve the poor and minorities
8780594 my generation is forever indebted to trailblazers like augustus gus hawkins
8780595 where barriers existed he tore them down when history was made he was at the forefront similarly reg weaver has earned his place in history as a critical voice on public education in this country and abroad during his six year tenure at the national education association
8780596 reg weaver led a groundbreaking organizational transformation effort designed to improve the quality of public schools

8780604 kontroversi yang berlegar di sekitar ned mempersoalkan tentang kebijaksanaan dalam memberikan arahan kepada pertubuhan yang seakan akan organisasi persendirian untuk menentukan keberkesanan dasar luar yang bebas dibawah kepalsuan
8780605 penyokong ned menegakkan pendirian bahawa sebuah organisasi persendirian adalah perlu untuk mengatasi kekangan yang membataskan aktiviti aktiviti sebuah agensi kerajaan namun begitu mereka menegaskan bahawa pembayar cukai rakyat amerika memberikan pembiayaan penuh untuk inisiatif ini
8780606 pengkritik ned memberikan tumpuan kepada percanggahan semulajadi yang berlaku dalam sebuah organisasi yang dibiayai oleh awam yang ditugaskan untuk melaksanakan dasar luar negara satu kuasa yang diberikan kepada kerajaan persekutuan di dalam perlembagaan yang masih belum dikekecualikan daripada semua kawalan politik dan pentadbiran
8780607 dalam analisis terakhir pembiayaan ini merangkumi aspek yang paling negatif dalam bantuan persendirian dan bantuan rasmi luar negara bahaya yang terselindung akibat daripada pengagihan kuasa pusat kepada peringkat bawahan dalam usaha dasar luar negara digabungkan pula dengan tekanan bahawa amerika syarikat sedang cuba untuk membuat percaturan di seluruh dunia

8780613 as australias largest home loan provider it makes good strategic sense to look at alternative investments in this industry that will continue to bring benefits to shareholders and consumers mr norris said
8780614 the australian mortgage and housing industries are the backbone of the economy and the purchase of a home remains the largest single investment made by many consumers
8780615 as this market continues to develop a strategic investment in one of the market leading providers in this industry is a natural fit for the group he added
8780616 current economic turbulence and changes reinforce the importance of continued investment in our brands experience of our management and sound fiscal management chairman gerry harvey said today
8780617 within the 2009 financial year a minimum of 15 new complexes for our brands will open

8780623 the dsp i did was to accomplish three goals one is to reduce the dynamic range without making it sound compressed very low ratio of 1 25 to 1 the second to apply eq in order to partially compensate for the lf rolloff of the mics used and finally i used the c4 processor to reduce pa or source hiss from space that was brought up in level by the use of rcl

8780630 ive been criticized for saying he inspires me to hell with my critics
8780631 i would have had no trouble voting for a guilty verdict we werent trying to send a message about the war or trying to take the moral high ground the government just didnt make a case there was nothing there
8780632 at the end of five years will we have broken the mold not much seems to be bubbling up that is inspiring or substantive
8780633 the security is very good and we are conducting training and joint operations with the coalition forces
8780634 weve sent a company to each checkpoint to train and live with the coalition forces
8780635 the forces out in wasit right now will be a professional force the iraqis can be proud of
8780636 i say that based on what ive seen this isf do theyre positive professional and they want to do a good job
8780637 we controlled the border between the two provinces and weve been very successful at preventing smugglers from entering into wasit
8780638 having the isf at the checkpoints will not degrade any operation they are conducting
8780639 it will create a more flexible and professional force as we conduct joint operations from the checkpoints to other areas
8780640 the rigorous studies clearly show red light cameras dont work

8780642 el inicio de la vida no se puede modificar por decreto o sentencia
8780643 eso lo podemos reclamar como sociedad los ministros debieron exponer hasta agotar todos los puntos para convencer a todos de por qu avalaron la norma con todos los puntos hasta el extremo ltimo que se necesite para convencer al ltimo y al m s convencido eso me parece que no lo vimos
8780644 tiene que ver fundamentalmente con el sentido educativo de las leyes las leyes deben promover determinados valores y en este caso el valor que nosotros hemos intentado promover en distintos foros es el valor supremo de la vida
8780645 si el congreso de la uni n dijera que la tierra es cuadrada la tierra ser a cuadrada si la suprema corte de justicia de la naci n confirmara como constitucional el planteamiento hecho por el congreso de la uni n respecto de que la tierra es cuadrada la tierra ser a cuadrada
8780646 puede la asamblea legislativa del distrito federal decir que el aborto no es aborto y que a partir de que as lo apruebe dentro de su seno el aborto deja de ser tal para convertirse en una interrupci n legal del embarazo puede definir el inicio del embarazo es posible que un congreso o un tribunal modifique la realidad o decreto o sentencia yo creo que no

8780650 el equipo dirigente de la instituci n ha argumentado por muchos a os que la auditor a de los rganos fiscalizadores lesiona o vulnera la autonom a universitaria

8780657 you cant blame an operator who was educated in the 1980s if they get 1980s results from 2008 systems
8780658 much of our initial efforts in energy efficiency have been in design
8780659 but the vast majority of buildings that will exist in 2030 also exist today so its also important that ashrae look at reducing energy in existing buildings through operational improvements and education
8780660 as education improves the long term drop off in building performance isnt quite as prominent
8780661 not only do you have great information on the building you have a permanent record of how systems are supposed to function
8780662 high performance needs to be all inclusive we cant improve buildings unless we can measure them
8780663 we need to decide as an industry what the performance metrics are for a high performance building
8780664 we wanted to take things from a holistic viewpoint and not just look at a couple of attributes
8780665 as an industry weve been doing it the other way forever its going to take a huge change of mind set
8780666 in an assembly plant it might be widgets per hour in a hospital it might be patient hours
8780667 you can make one little change in productivity and youre talking about very large dollar amounts
8780668 energy is obviously getting more and more expensive but if we can start measuring the productivity and output of the building were going to be surprised by the improvements we can make in the built environment
8780669 is it leed silver leed gold thirty nine points or 23 there still isnt a quantifiable measurement of what green is
8780670 there is no question we had unanimity that energy is the number one thing we do measure
8780671 the first paradigm we have to get around is that we have to spend more money to get an efficient building you dont
8780672 you just have to put more emphasis in the design that efficiency is important
8780673 develop and establish performance metrics and verification methods for high performance buildings systems and products that provide sustainability
8780674 we have all these meters and complex ways to measure energy but folks forget or they dont want to measure
8780675 what are the key metrics and measurements how do we simplify this to make it as easy as brushing your teeth in the morning
8780676 i think that everyone who gets into this realizes that the measurement and verification of energy targets is not well implemented out there
8780677 most owners or even federal agencies dont meter or submeter their buildings very well understanding where the energy is being used is difficult
8780678 it wasnt that we were trying to cover anything up we had a certain point in time that we needed the task force to deliver an assessment to the hill
8780679 we were comfortable doing that and comfortable with the recommendations pointing out some of the specific attributes and other actions that needed to be followed up on
8780680 still we have to worry about the hurricanes effect on this market
8780681 even if the damage from the approaching storm is fractional it could still be significant
8780682 the environment of sparse capacity means that every barrel of oil lost to the marketplace will be felt particularly as the northern hemispheres winter is just around the corner
8780683 he did tell me that there was gossip around the city gym that rene and gordon were faggots

8780689 while the directors believe it is probable that the mill project will proceed to completion the financing structure is yet to be finalised
8780690 and gunns cannot state with certainty that such a structure will be achievable nor can it provide an assurance that the mill project will proceed
8780691 discussions with potential debt providers are at various stages certain debt providers have indicated agreement in principle to facility terms with other debt providers discussions are ongoing
8780692 in addition gunns is continuing its discussions with a number of potential equity parties including industry participants who have expressed interest in making a direct equity investment in the mill project
8780693 it is gunns current intention that a joint venture equity partner will be invited to take up to a 50 per cent interest in the mill project however whether this eventuates will depend on the outcome of negotiations
8780694 the process with potential equity parties will take a period of time to work through and gunns does not expect the financing plan to be finalised before the first quarter of 2009 with principal construction activities unlikely to commence before then

8780711 our people just dont want their children to be fish in a bowl
8780712 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8780713 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8780714 now let there be no doubt the republican nominee john mccain has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect and next week well also hear about those occasions when hes broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 of the time sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 905 of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8780715 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8780716 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8780717 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8780718 i thought he voted with bush 95 of the time

8780747 if we look at your average medieval town or your average greek polis most are about the scale of those we find in this part of the amazon

8780749 some of the practices that these folks hammered may provide alternative forms of understanding how to do low level sustainable development today
8780750 these are not cities but this is urbanism built around towns
8780751 if you find it in europe its a city if you find it somewhere else it has to be something else
8780752 they have quite remarkable planning and self organization more so than many classical examples of what people would call urbanism
8780753 this throws a wrench in all the models suggesting we are looking at primordial biodiversity

8780786 isnt well schooled and prepared to be president of the united states
8780787 you have got people encouraged to buy a block of land way out of the city and they are having to travel for three hours a day to commute thats not sustainable
8780788 people there live in town houses or terrace houses the houses are never one storey and you have got the population that lives closer to the city
8780789 we have to curtail land subdivisions at the extremities of the city the other option is to put in some very fast trains to regional centres somewhere like geelong could be an attractive destination for working and living
8780790 the population is still growing and theres a demand for these properties
8780791 its near impossible to dictate to the market what should happen the thing thats keeping victorias economy very competitive compared to the mining states is we are very competitive in housing
8780792 we try really hard not to put elderly people in chairs
8780793 its awful its the worst its been for years were powerless to do anything
8780794 staff are being pushed to the limits it is a bottleneck it is a shambles and it is only going to get worse
8780795 we havent been able to get a private patient into a private hospital for weeks theyre full too
8780796 im not sure suspending elective surgery for a week would be enough it might take two
8780797 what i do expect is hospital management to make decisions on a daily basis about what is in the best interests of providing safe patient care
8780798 if that means theyve got to temporarily suspend elective surgery then unfortunately if that decision is made in the interests of patient safety i support that i would rather that not be the case but thats the reality of the very busy times we are experiencing at the moment
8780799 people dont get fed properly people get sleep deprived the staff get frustrated as well it leads to a whole snowball effect
8780800 i can give you three instances of elderly people falling out of trolleys because they were confused they should never have been on trolleys in the emergency department
8780801 increasing the amount of time that patients spend in an emergency department leads to deaths
8780802 the number of long stay patients in queensland emergency departments has skyrocketed in the last couple of months
8780803 entire health system in queensland is in danger of collapse
8780804 particularly in queensland and western australia were seeing many school leavers heading straight out to the mines and putting university and tertiary education on the back burner
8780805 with the way of the world today people need to work to survive and tafe and traineeships often provide more work ready skills than universities
8780806 student debt and poor workforce planning is influencing a move towards more practical learning
8780807 a lot of people want to do training that gets them to the top quickly and furthering your skills later on in your career via a degree is always an option
8780808 however sales commerce and business are professions more competitive driven than reliant upon an employees tertiary education
8780809 depending on where you want to be a university degree may not be necessary
8780810 crazy thinking in the 21st century from a government thats supposed to be committed to social inclusion
8780811 so i have a solution to the health care crisis and it will cost not one thin dime
8780812 there were too few trials involving herbs and supplements in infertility to warrant a solid recommendation but chasteberry antioxidants and fertility blend chasteberry green tea extracts l arginine vitamins e b6 and b12 folate iron magnesium zinc and selenium have some preliminary support

8780814 pad will take total responsibility for security at government house so we have asked all police to handover to us
8780815 there are no longer any police inside and senior police will today meet to respond to this action
8780816 because of the over the top charges especially the charge of treason
8780817 the fact is that us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders
8780818 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
8780819 those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8780820 i dont think theres anything to announce yet but i know that that is under discussion
8780821 it is time to establish the truth about the crimes committed before and during russias invasion of georgia
8780822 georgia continues the redeployment of its forces in the direction of south ossetia and the restoration of the combat capability of its troops
8780823 i did a lot of aces and she made a lot of mistakes
8780824 well see what happens but were in good shape the gap in the championship is big but well keep fighting until its over
8780825 we had a great result at misano last year and that added to the fact that were in good shape with the set up and the tyres means we can be reasonably confident of another good result here
8780826 im really excited to be going to misano in such good shape and leading the championship
8780827 last year the race was a huge disappointment for us a very low point of the season and especially sad because it happened in front of my home fans
8780828 but this time things are very different weve had two fantastic races in a row and we are feeling very strong and very confident we are out to make up for 2007
8780829 misano is so close to my home town of tavullia that i know there will be an army of italian fans there and i hope its going to be a great party for all of them
8780830 last year there was some terrible weather before the race as well so i really hope that this year we have sunshine and we can enjoy a fantastic race by the sea
8780831 i am hoping that we can have a better weekend at misano though i had bad luck there last year another rider knocked me off at the very first corner
8780832 we do but we arent supposed to be advertising it
8780833 my kid is oddly quiet and i just know something horrible is happening right about now

8780843 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me
8780844 that is not the judgment we need that wont keep america safe we need a president who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past
8780845 america cannot afford to take a 10 chance of change
8780846 purists are not going to like this and not everyone is going to like it
8780847 we are going to do our best to do it quickly and accurately
8780848 that is how many weve had so far and it will vary from year to year
8780849 when we come back with a ruling from video replay there is no argument unless it involves spectator interference and then the manager is entitled to an explanation
8780850 were only talking about home runs balls were not talking about plays at third base or balls and strikes or any of those things were just talking about a select portion of the game
8780851 sometimes with the configurations of these ballparks and so forth it makes it tough
8780852 im a throwback old baseball guy and i like the way that baseball is played and i like the part where the umpires decision held up and at the same time it didnt mean that they dont miss them and they dont get them right thats part of it
8780853 i think instant replay will definitely help that but i think it will take a little bit longer in the game and every year we go to spring training and the season starts and they always talk to us about shortening the time of the game
8780854 if they have to do a replay youre standing out there for five minutes doing nothing
8780855 they want to speed the game up make the call
8780856 the way they are building them now with all the angles its tougher to see what is going on
8780857 it doesnt really matter either way for me i hope it doesnt distract anything i hope they get the calls right
8780858 i know if i hit a ball and its a home run and it gets called a double and they go to replay and change it im going to be excited
8780859 and if its reversed its going to be one of those things where it shouldnt have been a home run in the first place
8780860 its a very fair result and we appreciate the nfl taking a second look
8780861 brandon was thrilled its as good as we expected or hoped for

8780865 these are not cities but this is urbanism built around towns
8780866 if we look at your average medieval town or your average greek polis most are about the scale of those we find in this part of the amazon only the ones we find are much more complicated in terms of their planning
8780867 were proud of what weve done on our environmental leadership the things weve done around renewables and the things were doing to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions
8780868 so in one respect weve got a very positive story to tell and we dont have a problem it wherever we can do so
8780869 i think since thats happened youve seen a sea change in terms of the industry and frankly a lot of the regulators approach to coal plants
8780870 while everyones trying to determine whether capture and sequestration will be feasible and economical
8780871 i think it lends to credence to the arguments that weve been making that these are risky investments
8780872 and that shareholders deserve to be notified of the fact that because these are riskier investments regulators in the future may not want to pass those higher costs on to consumers meaning shareholders would be on the hook for them
8780873 youve seen a sea change in terms of the industry and frankly a lot of the regulators approach to coal plants
8780874 it remains to be seen what the reaction is to any risk level with the investment
8780875 i would think that a project like big stone ii that is more efficient would actually have more value in carbon constrained environment
8780876 i think its a way for the council to show that they recognise diversity
8780877 usually its a prayer that relates to community harmony and peace and finding common ground
8780878 there is a huge amount of uncertainty as to why there are big natural swings in co2 levels
8780879 its clear from our work that the greenland ice sheet is very sensitive to carbon dioxide levels but its wrong to draw inferences about what will happen
8780880 you cant say that if you get to the level of 400 ppm the ice sheet will melt in the next hundred years because we dont know enough about the process it might be easier to create an icesheet than to melt if you reverse what you did before you dont necessarily get the same answer back

8780888 the most recent ice retreat reflects melting in the chukchi sea off the alaskan coast and the east siberian seas off the coast of eastern russia
8780889 envisat observations from mid august depict that a new record of low sea ice coverage could be reached in a matter of weeks
8780890 polarstern will circumnavigate the whole arctic ocean and exit through the northeast passage
8780891 the polar regions especially the arctic are very sensitive indicators of climate change
8780892 the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change has shown that these regions are highly vulnerable to rising temperatures and predicted that the arctic would be virtually ice free in the summer months by 2070
8780893 other scientists claim it could become ice free as early as 2040
8780894 latest satellite observations suggest that the arctic could be mainly ice free even earlier
8780895 our study suggests that if sea ice continues to contract rapidly over the next several years arctic land warming and permafrost thaw are likely to accelerate
8780896 the loss of sea ice can trigger widespread changes that would be felt across the region
8780897 evidence shows that around three million years ago there was an increase in the amount of rock and debris deposited on the ocean floor around greenland
8780898 these rocks could not have got there until icebergs started to form and could transport them indicating that large amounts of ice on greenland only began to form about three million years ago
8780899 prior to that greenland was largely ice free and probably covered in grass and forest furthermore atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were relatively high so the question we wanted to answer was why did greenland become covered in an ice sheet
8780900 it is very different from what we might expect using certain classic models of urbanism
8780901 the whole landscape is almost like a latticework the way it is gridded off
8780902 the individual centers themselves are much less constructed it is more patterned at the regional level

8781009 a waste of agricultural land in times when the world needs more crop output

8781040 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
8781041 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
8781042 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
8781043 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
8781044 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
8781045 trying to be voice of community to bring people in and engage people who feel a digital divide who feel excluded from technology our core user group

8781052 it just grabbed a little bit nowhere near to the extent of the first time
8781053 they think i might have broken up some scar tissue but it doesnt feel as bad hopefully ill be back sooner
8781054 i hope i only miss a couple of weeks but the bigger picture is i want to be out there at the end of the year
8781055 i dont want to rip it up im going to be smart listen to what mike and the trainers say coming back right now wouldnt be smart
8781056 a little longer than day to day hes going to need a little bit of time
8781057 were not as deep as we were 48 hours ago
8781058 but we have a good team were going to move forward
8781059 weve been looking for the past few days to add middle infield depth
8781060 with the injuries we suffered were taking a stronger and harder look
8781061 theres less movement in my swing but i feel the same power
8781062 i fooled around with it last year but didnt commit to it it finally clicked im glad i stuck with it
8781063 he got his hands in a better spot and feels comfortable
8781064 this nigga shape up is shitty sharp look at them points
8781065 john mccain likes to say hell follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell he wont even follow him to the cave he lives in
8781066 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8781067 mccain has been in the system for the last 27 years and im like wamp wamp wat it do wat it do
8781068 just like that i gotta go in im talking to little cousins that like yankee and all that and theyre starting to believe that john mccain is the best candidate i cant have that
8781069 i opened the newspaper and got sick to my stomach
8781070 i felt like i wanted to vomit when i seen that the reason why i called him a sellout is because i feel he did that for a publicity look rather than the issues that are affecting his people that look up to him how could you want john mccain in office when george bush and the republicans already have half a million people losing their homes in foreclosure were fighting an unjust war its the latinos and black kids up in the frontlines fighting that war we over here trying to take the troops out of iraq and bring peace this guy immediately wants war if not with iraq or afghanistan hell start a new one with iran i feel real disgusted that daddy yankee would do that either he did that for a look or hes just not educated on politics
8781071 there are not enough persons of color who want to be police officers

8781078 i want you to do the job in my neighborhood as you do in minnetonka edina and bloomington
8781079 all we want from the police officers is to be fair
8781080 we go through three or four steps of different grievance processes while they continue to work
8781081 my discipline is on hold until the officers go through their grievance process
8781082 it slows everything way down in order for due process to take place
8781083 people were giving some real concrete concerns and they were sharing that with the police chiefs i also think that the police chiefs were giving their honest opinions in regard to what their goals were
8781084 i think cultural training is very important and i think that could possibly break down some of the barriers in terms of communication
8781085 we promise you that we will continue to pursue these issues
8781086 people responded and interacted i think we are off to a very good beginning of this process
8781087 i felt pretty good that i got my information and some ideas out and i got some information that can help me when i go back to the department tomorrow
8781088 i wished we could have been more focused on policy
8781089 but when people have the opportunity to speak to police chiefs they want to be able to say what they want to say
8781090 it is going to be important for the council the communities of color and other agencies and organizations to put forth a criminal justice agenda that is going to make a difference in 2009
8781091 i think this was a great first forum i was very impressed with the people who showed up i hope we double and triple our attendance at the next one scheduled for october

8781109 it is great to see the court confirm that the dmca protects services like youtube that follow the law and respect copyrights
8781110 has a strong dmca policy takes active steps to limit incidents of infringement on its web site and works diligently to keep unauthorized works off its site
8781111 authorization permission or consent to use the registered copyrighted works owned by plaintiffs that have appeared and continue to appear on the youtube site

8781164 we deeply regret the fact that we have been forced to cease all zoom operations
8781165 it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff
8781166 even as late as lunchtime today thursday we believed we had secured a new investment package to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying
8781167 having been unable to complete the investment package the directors of zoom had no option but to instigate insolvency administration proceedings
8781168 these are things that we re going to work through and if we find passengers in difficult circumstances everybody s going to have to work together to deal with that
8781169 our discussions with zoom today led us to take this action

8781216 promise of a land where all men are free and equal
8781217 there are those who say to you we are rushing this issue of civil rights i say we are 172 years late
8781218 the time has arrived for the democratic party to get out of the shadow of states rights and walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine of human rights
8781219 standing up with courage and clear purpose they somehow managed to change the world
8781220 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8781221 on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
8781222 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8781223 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8781224 there is a way that seems right to a man but its end is the way to death
8781225 but each man is tempted when he is drawn away by his own lust and enticed 15 then the lust when it has conceived bears sin and the sin when it is full grown brings forth death
8781226 food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food
8781227 the body is not meant for sexual immorality but for the lord and the lord for the body
8781228 the body is meant for sexual immorality and sexual immorality for the body
8781229 no one is fooled when we proclaim that the gay movement has nothing to do with kids and their sexuality many of us both women and men had our first homosexual experience with partners who were older than ourselves
8781230 repeal of all laws governing the age of sexual consent
8781231 but god shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners christ died for us 9 since therefore we have now been justified by his blood much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of god
8781232 for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous

8781234 i read the first sentence amp almost imploded it took me over an hour to go back to even beginning to read the rest
8781235 ive already said to your step mother that i hope you two are going to make up before the wedding
8781236 i dont want to be at your wedding if im able to go without my wife especially if your step father is there
8781237 how do we know hes not going to be president
8781238 over 30 years ago i was teaching religion to high school students in the phillips neighborhood and i was telling them to do community service works even though i knew what they had to face when they went home and they knew that i knew
8781239 then i decided i needed to start doing service work for this community and one of our biggest hurdles was housing rent could take up over 50 of a minimum wage earners salary with the help of many volunteers and donors we bought up houses on two blocks some sold for 1 or 30 000 we used a lot of duct tape to fix a lot of repairs
8781240 but the dealers would march with us with their signs reading
8781241 we outgrew our apartment and moved into a house with six bedrooms which we called st joseph house it was run from the attic where the sisters lived it was the beginning of what is now called hope community
8781242 we soon learned that people needed to rely on their own power and strength by gathering together saying what they needed and then acting on their goals
8781243 we condemn people for being homeless or poor when our wealth goes to honeywell supporting the military is not about patriotism it is about greed
8781244 although the vigils and demonstrations have focused on different weapon systems over the years the main theme has always been to reduce the military budget funding human needs peace conversion and advocating for nonviolent alternatives to violent solutions for complex problems
8781245 every wednesday morning i would go out to honeywell with a banner and a prayer they would lock us out or we would lock them out i got jailed 50 times for civil disobedience and 12 years later i was known as a civil resister
8781246 she is faithful to her cause of peace we were lawbreakers since the 17th century the beginning of our order of carondelet sisters in france some of can be activists others cannot and then some of us are just indolent
8781247 isnt well schooled and prepared to be president of the united states
8781248 she knows when my stuff is ripening she knows her stuff about food and promoting local food
8781249 i think there is a real connection between a healthy community and keeping our money in the local economy by supporting local farmers
8781250 creating that long term relationship with the farmers is key
8781251 its very easy to work with the farmers here you just make the connection have a conversation about your needs and then put it into motion
8781252 i got the desire to get my hands back in the soil and get more in touch with the source of my food
8781253 people really appreciate the fresh alternatives they can get here
8781254 they feel like theyre getting healthy food and they feel good when they eat it they get pretty excited when they realize how fresh the food is that it was picked as recently as this morning
8781255 you have to be persistent and be willing to prove your stuff is better that what they are going to get from the distributor
8781256 you cant just show up one day and say i have a bunch of cauliflower restaurants plan their menus two weeks out
8781257 i throw the words local growers in as much as possible when communicating with the public
8781258 dine fresh dine local is a great opportunity for restaurateurs like stephanie to highlight the quality food they source from local growers
8781259 it also highlights how diners communities and the landscape can benefit when eateries partner with local growers
8781260 isnt well schooled and prepared to be president of the united states
8781261 we can actually do our work in some ways we are very very happy
8781262 i am fearful of the 36 hour hold in minneapolis
8781263 i havent heard anything about any organized targeting but with individual officers preventive detention is not out of the realm of possibility
8781264 generally in the past police officers target convergence space spaces where activists tend to gather before big events
8781265 the police dont really do anything but ask a lot of questions and say things like we are watching you and we know you are with this group or that group or you know this person and this person is on our list
8781266 we have also seen visiting by police officers of individuals at their homes and businesses in an attempt to intimidate
8781267 isnt well schooled and prepared to be president of the united states
8781268 we need to build the economy from the bottom up
8781269 and not do this trickle down stuff because everybody knows that doesnt work
8781270 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8781271 i dont believe that sen mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8781272 but what it really means is youre on your own
8781273 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8781274 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8781275 let us agree that patriotism has no party the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together intonation rising and some died together rising and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america crescendo or a blue america they have served the united states of america
8781276 it is that promise that 45 years ago today brought americans form every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream

8781288 wed run the state hospital system the way that we ran it in the 1990s where the commentators generally admit that we did a far better job than our predecessor in the government that came after
8781289 hospitals are not only about writing out cheques its all about management its about making sure that youve got your resources going into front end services
8781290 people keep saying im blaming this and im blaming that
8781291 what im trying to do is explain the range of pressures that were under
8781292 there are multiple pressure points and weve got to deal with each of them but first of all weve actually got to have an open and honest discussion about the pressure points in our hospital system
8781293 thats where the money has to go not into fat salaries of bureaucrats that is gobbling up large chunks of the queensland health budget and its denying the hospitals the resources and the manpower they need to treat sick queenslanders
8781294 well release our policy in a short to medium period of time and it will deal with the issues that ive raised

8781299 parents should feel reassured that current events have no effect on the day to day running of our centres he said
8781300 we appreciate the significant role our services play in the lives of all of our families and the provision of a safe educational and fun environment for the children remains our number one priority

8781303 what does it say about your judgment when your judgement says george bush has been right more than 90 of the time im not ready to take a 10 chance on change
8781304 they call this the ownership society what it really means is youre on your own its time for them to own their failure
8781305 government should do that which we cannot do for ourselves our government should work for us not against us
8781306 hopefully i can provide some assistance in the future to this school and all that it can be
8781307 i know you are working very hard and struggling to bring up this school but i have said i will assist the school and i will do so
8781308 there was no doubt among us teachers that is what he meant we interpreted his words as meaning he would help fund the school either personally or by raising sponsors or both in order to give our school desperately needed modern facilities and a facelift
8781309 dont touch the seat dont put your mouth on that dirty wall get up off the floor now
8781310 lets save this one for when youre interning with jane goodall
8781311 a foreign policy that is smart as well as strong
8781312 i know something about close elections i believe this election is so close because the forces of the status quo are so desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8781313 military experts warn us about security concerns from global warming
8781314 the special interests that have come to control the republican party
8781315 were all tired of appeals based on fear youre hungry for a new politics based on bipartisan respect for the ageless principles embodied in the united states constitution
8781316 inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance
8781317 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8781318 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8781319 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8781320 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8781321 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8781322 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8781323 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8781324 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8781325 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8781326 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8781327 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8781328 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8781329 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8781330 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8781331 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8781332 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8781333 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8781334 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8781335 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8781336 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8781337 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8781338 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8781339 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8781340 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8781341 if one of my daughters boyfriends turns out to be vegetarian i swear to god id never forgive them
8781342 my biggest nightmare would be if the kids ever came up to me and said
8781343 i will talk to people about the advantages of vegetarianism and it will upset me if weve had a good conversation and they turn around and say something stupid
8781344 if my daughter ever grew up and married a vegetarian id never forgive her but even that i would forgive because its not my affair its not up to me if he talks stupid or not
8781345 i intend to move the norwegian embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem as quickly as possible why should the rest of the world cave in to the enormous arab pressure and not have their embassies in the capital of the country this is not happening anywhere else we need to stand tall and give our support to israel
8781346 i dont believe that the israeli palestinian conflict can be resolved by using the road map for peace any truce negotiated with fatah will be sabotaged by organizations loyal to hamas hamas is part of an international terror network trained and financed by iran hamas and other organizations like them are constantly provoking israel to keep the conflict alive
8781347 its obvious who bill parcells favorite dolphin is nobody even comes close to ricky williams who often puts a smile on parcells face parcells usually makes a point of pulling a player or two aside every few days to bless them with some of the wisdom hes gained over the years
8781348 my asia pacific leader rashmy chatterjee also manages general business and channels and my other counterparts regionally have that responsibility already so it made sense to take on the role myself
8781349 this is an opportunity to get synergy across the teams my focus is to educate the general business team on the benefits of partners and get them working with the channels team more closely we will be looking at which partners can add value in an opportunity and getting partners more involved
8781350 we want to start proactively by driving an account plan talking about external routes to market and looking at what roles our partners can play
8781351 weve got some big accounts in our general business segment such as adelaide bank and rio tinto which all now fall into my realm of responsibility
8781352 when you look at the scale and breadth of these deals theres a lot of scope to engage and work with partners now
8781353 shes extremely disappointed in herself she knows that not only has she let the community down shes let herself down
8781354 ive said before shes embarrassed and she knows that shes made a mistake

8781360 weve just renewed our agreement with google for an additional three years this agreement now ends in november of 2011 rather than november of 2008 so we have stability in income
8781361 a method and system in a document viewer for scrolling a substantially exact increment in a document such as one page regardless of whether the zoom is such that some all or one page is currently being viewed
8781362 in one implementation pressing a page down or page up keyboard key button allows a user to begin at any starting vertical location within a page and navigate to that same location on the next or previous page
8781363 for example if a user is viewing a page starting in a viewing area from the middle of that page and ending at the bottom a page down command will cause the next page to be shown in the viewing area starting at the middle of the next page and ending at the bottom of the next page similar behaviour occurs when there is more than one column of pages being displayed in a row
8781364 what is the alternative there is no clear solution and i dont think people have got the bottle to see this through we are with gordon come what may
8781365 i thought the whole match was very tough mentally and i thought i dealt with it pretty well
8781366 im very happy with the win hes got a huge serve and being a lefty makes it tougher hes definitely one of the top net players in the game hed give anyone a tough match very rarely does he lose easily to anyone
8781367 i said what needed to be said its not nice when you dont have confidence in the calls you just want to be able to play
8781368 i have to emphasise again how delighted i am that gareth is staying i am ecstatic but so is the dressing room it is a big lift for us it feels like we have a new player a few weeks ago i thought gareth would have gone by now
8781369 nzx has assessed the process the market participant uses to complete reconciliations of its client funds accounts at present and is satisfied sufficient processes checks and controls are in place
8781370 this is a remarkable man at a vital moment america would be crazy to throw this opportunity away america must not throw this opportunity away
8781371 at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future let us keep that promise that american promise and in the words of scripture hold firmly without wavering to the hope that we confess
8781372 he raced at a time when racing was extremely dangerous and got through it all without a serious injury
8781373 he had an extraordinary mechanical sense he was very much in tune with the car
8781374 i as well as all employees of ferrari are extremely saddened by the news of the passing of phil hill a man and a champion who gave so much to ferrari
8781375 phil and i have always kept in touch throughout the years and i know i will miss his passion and love for ferrari very much
8781376 and he knew it off the top of his head he was extremely intelligent and well rounded he was an opera expert and very well read he was very sophisticated
8781377 phil was a very special guy and had a love for the automotive age
8781378 he was always a potential winner when he sat in a race car he was both a competitor and a close friend and a fellow i could look up to
8781379 imagination is the beginning of creation you imagine what you desire you will get what you imagine and at last you create what you will
8781380 you cant divorce your beliefs and your politics from your art
8781381 she expanded the curriculum to represent a more international and gender fair focus
8781382 the badgers have some injury concerns and akron will keep it close for a while but new starting quarterback allan evridge will settle in after halftime as wisconsins running backs begin to wear down the zips defense expect a big game for running back p j hill and linebacker deandre levy
8781383 the zips who have a recent history of getting pounded in road openers might be the worst team in the mac they also will be going against a very experienced defense on the bright side they are pretty good on special teams and their kicker has good range
8781384 since the big ten meetings in july badgers coach bret bielema has been defending wisconsins non conference schedule this tough akron team with a proud tradition that includes gerry faust should be a solid measuring stick
8781385 the best reason for badgers fans to stick around for the full game will be to hear the band play during the fifth quarter
8781386 expect a sloppy game from akron as wisconsins defense makes up for lost time
8781387 i have a story idea for you talk to local stylists and ask them who has better hair cuts or styles democrats or republicans
8781388 i just think that im probably in dangerous territory here but i think obama is to politics what elvis presley was to music he was able to crossover hes a black man who appeals to white voters and so many other people as well and its not just looks its the whole package i think others that had really good messages were threatening or dangerous to whites
8781389 we did our best to find local tools and capability however theres none
8781390 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease and i will restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
8781391 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8781392 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8781393 dont know how will i am amp john legend came across on tv but it was moving in the stadium
8781394 the mass delegation has the absolute worst seats of any state
8781395 i am being politically persecuted by those defeated yesterday in a just and necessary war
8781396 the ones we defeated abandoned their armed struggle and morphed into peaceful civilians
8781397 nobody can free their homeland by killing their fellow countrymen
8781398 their equipment doesnt change on the data center floor but we come in and pay cash for the equipment the equipment comes off their balance sheets and now we own it and we write a lease
8781399 it generates cash for the bank and it gets their existing assets on a technology refresh cycle
8781400 it a lottery would certainly help all of us in terms of writing less submissions to government but i can understand why state treasuries oppose it
8781401 scott seamers a perfect example he won the melbourne cup on ethereal and now hes still punching around horses in queensland without really getting rides in big carnivals
8781402 so one year hes the toast of the town and the next year no one wants to know him and thats essentially the way racing is
8781403 we need to have some funds to start them off and thats what were asking for
8781404 weve been asking for the industry for a while and its come down to actually asking out of prize money because every industry racing body government body weve spoken to is very supportive but no one wants to come up with the cold hard funds to kick off this sort of scenario
8781405 the hershey company is committed to supporting breast cancer education and awareness we want to offer real ways to get involved so this year we added a virtual component to our annual four day charity bike ride

8781407 the hershey companys commitment to the young survival coalition funds vital programs and services for young women battling breast cancer
8781408 through the hershey brands and hersheys tour de pink bike ride we are fulfilling our mission to raise awareness and funds for young women and their families
8781409 i love the blogs name its also an appropriate moniker for middle age cyclists who i suspect use that third chainring occasionally
8781410 i really like your blog going to have to add it to my daily websites
8781411 it covers a wide spectrum of cycling issues european and domestic racing as well as some of the history and tradition of the sport very well written and presented
8781412 lately ive been enjoying the collaborative cycling blog run in part by former chicagoan leonard basobas as someone who admittedly doesnt follow the nrc much except for when its racing nearby this fans point of view is useful for staying abreast of the various personalities and storylines
8781413 where can i find the new music video for panic at the disco
8781414 we got a chance to look at a lot of players tonight im anxious to see the film and see how all that turned out its hard to evaluate from the sideline but well get a good look at it and that will certainly help us in our evaluation the game was a lot different from the last time we played them here a high scoring game we didnt play too much defense tonight and the giants are a good football team we got a good test we finished a lot better than it started offensively well see how all that comes together and make some decisions here over the weekend and then starting getting ready for kansas city
8781415 i think you always look forward to the start of the regular season but we have a lot of work to do between now and then a lot of decisions
8781416 they need to turn themselves in because this is not right i couldve lost my daughter last night and just turned 14 today
8781417 it was remarkable to see how the community came together and everyones been really supportive
8781418 every year its gone to flint hills bread basket here in town
8781419 whether its watermelon or climbing on an inflatable this town and school shows that no obstacle can dampen their school spirit
8781420 there are regions affected by the storm that our teams have not been able to reach

8781423 will not enter his plea to the indictment until the new one which he will be judged upon is finished
8781424 we will ensure that it reflects the current case law facts already established by the court and evidence collected over the past eight years
8781425 of all the evil men of the balkans he is the worst
8781426 we certainly talked about the complexity of the challenges that we have in the border area the pressure that we believe needs to be applied there for lots of reasons not the least of which is the effect its having on the fight in afghanistan
8781427 a very clear need from a us standpoint and from the pakistani standpoint that we have got to figure out a way to get at this problem
8781428 is undertaking operations that were not ongoing a few months ago
8781429 i am encouraged that hes taking action and i also think its going to take some time
8781430 expectations for instantaneous results are probably a little bit too high
8781431 the meeting was mainly to continue to discuss ongoing operations against extremists in the border region and to work together to find better ways to solve those problems
8781432 what scientists have only recently begun to realize is that people may do their best thinking when they are not concentrating on work at all
8781433 are we even craft people or are we simply the directors of craft people
8781434 amen amen i say to you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up another way the same is a thief and a robber
8781435 i could no longer study because i dont have a social security number so
8781436 people are into style into how they and their clothes look why not be into the pc they carry
8781437 who like to attract attention and show off in their facebook photos
8781438 im not sure scent is on the top of many oem to do lists but asus has innovated a few things that others have looked into before
8781439 windows pcs from whatever vendor are overdue for a style infusion
8781440 there are so many consumers who for whatever reason stick with windows but who nonetheless look over and think that macbook air really looks cool
8781441 the taliban had sabotaged a number of key bridges along the road between kabul and kandahar
8781442 our job was to come out of our province to rebuild those bridges and to move back safely

8781451 whats the correlation between english proficiency and success in sports
8781452 john mccain likes to say hell follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell but hes not even willing to go to the cave where he lives
8781453 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8781454 because if you dont have any fresh ideas then you use stale tactics to scare the voters if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from
8781455 what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8781456 he took the last 8 years of the bush administration and shouted enough
8781457 as you know im a believer and ive never pretended not to be and i respect those who have no religious belief its a free country mr rudd said
8781458 for me its ultimately the order of the cosmos or what i describe as the creation
8781459 you cant simply have in my own judgment creation simply being a random event because it is so inherently ordered and the fact that the natural environment is being ordered where it can properly coexist over time
8781460 if you were simply reducing that to mathematically probabilities ive got to say it probably wouldnt have happened
8781461 so i think there is an intelligent mind at work
8781462 theres no change at this stage but that depends on journalists and if they put picket lines in place
8781463 we would expect our people not to cross a picket line
8781464 we have a number of staff who are contractually exempt from industrial action
8781465 the plan is to continue to put out the newspapers absolutely as normal and we are well advanced in doing that
8781466 we see no concern in getting the papers out tonight saturday and sunday and monday and beyond if necessary
8781467 its my understanding that mike was unprepared to write during the strike
8781468 this is an indication again that the new regime at fairfax media is embarking on a low quality approach to journalism
8781469 the management is prepared to trample on anyone who gets in their way and the people who will lose out in this case are the sydney morning herald readers
8781470 brutal said further bureau mergers and cuts were being considered
8781471 we have got a problem now with the company it is being run by people who dont have ink in their veins
8781472 and this latest act is basically bowing to the market and saying weve got a market downturn here and what do we do we reach for the knife this is really a pretty brutal way of doing it
8781473 in discussion that weve had in the last couple of days theyve said not only the canberra bureaux of the two great newspapers are on the table but also so too are foreign bureaux
8781474 if willing there are a lot of ways and justifications if not willing a lot of excuses
8781475 oh that you would bless me indeed and enlarge my territory that your hand be with me that you would keep me from evil that i may not cause pain
8781476 amen amen i say to you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up another way the same is a thief and a robber
8781477 i could no longer study because i dont have a social security number so
8781478 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
8781479 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8781480 i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again the last best hope for those who are called to the cause of peace
8781481 i get it i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
8781482 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8781483 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me
8781484 on november 4 we must stand up and say eight years is enough
8781485 let there be no doubt the republican nominee john mccain has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect
8781486 im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
8781487 i dont believe senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8781488 why else would he define middle class as someone making under us5 million a year
8781489 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8781490 hes now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
8781491 the same policies those policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
8781492 look bro we are reaching if not already reached peak oil peak coal and peak natural gas
8781493 arent facebook and myspace really closed meshes and how can we connect to them
8781494 facebook group that he is writing a movie about the founding of the popular social network

8781497 within the 2009 financial year a minimum of 15 new complexes for our brands will open
8781498 the investment in and development of retail complexes is an essential component of our business strategy with current developments in the queensland victoria south australia western australia and new zealand

8781504 we have a number of staff who are contractually exempt from industrial action mr kirk said
8781505 the plan is to continue to put out the newspapers absolutely as normal and we are well advanced in doing that
8781506 we see no concern in getting the papers out tonight saturday and sunday and monday and beyond if necessary
8781507 around the world there is a real recognition now that deforestation is one of the major drivers of climate change and a recognition that primary forests are huge carbon stores and they know that their investors their shareholders are going to be very unhappy she said
8781508 the environment message has been out there for years and finally the australian and tasmanian governments are getting the message that shareholders are going to drive companies to actually get out of native forests
8781509 peter garrett must draw the line under the project and say its over
8781510 we need to hear from minister garrett and the tasmanian government that there will be no extensions no rolling over
8781511 clearly peter garrett has lost the passion senator milne said
8781512 the question is has he got the backbone to exercise the power
8781513 hes rolled over on beverley will he roll over on the pulp mill
8781514 will he give gunns that extension or will he agree that october the 4th is the cut off
8781515 the ball is absolutely in his court the country is looking to see if the peter garrett they thought they knew still exists
8781516 we have a number of staff who are contractually exempt from industrial action
8781517 the plan is to continue to put out the newspapers absolutely as normal and we are well advanced in doing that
8781518 we see no concern in getting the papers out tonight saturday and sunday and monday and beyond if necessary
8781519 brutal said further bureau mergers and cuts were being considered
8781520 we have got a problem now with the company it is being run by people who dont have ink in their veins
8781521 and this latest act is basically bowing to the market and saying weve got a market downturn here and what do we do we reach for the knife this is really a pretty brutal way of doing it
8781522 in discussion that weve had in the last couple of days theyve said not only the canberra bureaux of the two great newspapers are on the table but also so too are foreign bureaux
8781523 you can slim it down to one bureau in canberra covering everything but you end up diminishing the analysis of the democratic process and very seriously so
8781524 notes from the trail presidential politics from the inside out
8781525 where possible we would advise passengers to use alternative means of transport
8781526 there are a few things id like to change we got into a rhythm and i didnt want to come out of the game
8781527 hopefully in these next few days we can heal up
8781528 everyone knows were pretty banged up it will be nice to get some rest and get all our guys back and be 100 percent for dallas
8781529 the plan was to get a couple of three and outs and then take the players out but it didnt turn out that way we didnt play well believe me if we could put our finger on it we would have done something about it before now weve got a little bit more time to get it right
8781530 we havent played well that is all you can say about it we have not made all the effort we need to play well all the things that go into playing well we havent done once we get all our guys going i feel we will have a very strong defense
8781531 we would have liked to have a touchdown on that first one which was a little upsetting
8781532 after i made a few tackles i felt like daniel bullocks is back
8781533 it was good to get that tackle out of the way because it gave me more confidence
8781534 i didnt see him an awful lot but i felt him
8781535 you can hear him hit and you can feel his hits so that was great for us to get him out there
8781536 we like him as a runner but you cant keeping laying the ball on the ground
8781537 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8781538 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8781539 i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8781540 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less
8781541 more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet
8781542 more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8781543 the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8781544 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8781545 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations
8781546 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8781547 the real point is does this just feed into the growing perception that what we have is one big glitzy production
8781548 but really after the crowd files out after the fireworks take place the question remains what is left and is this person ready to be president of the united states
8781549 we have not journeyed all this way across the centuries
8781550 wgn radio is giving right wing hatchet man stanley kurtz a forum to air his baseless fear mongering terrorist smears
8781551 hes currently scheduled to spend a solid two hour block from 9 00 to 11 00 p m pushing lies distortions and manipulations about barack and university of illinois professor william ayers
8781552 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
8781553 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves
8781554 at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies
8781555 were not sure that we have all or any of the answers
8781556 obama is acquiring a reputation for staggering self importance and regard you dont play into that
8781557 tonight i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land
8781558 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are here to restore that legacy ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8781559 amen amen i say to you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up another way the same is a thief and a robber
8781560 i could no longer study because i dont have a social security number so
8781561 the people of the border area share and are united by a single history a language and a culture even though the land is separated by an international border for which reason the border area peoples cannot be divided with the start of the building of the border fence it not only tries to divide a territory more it also tries to divide one people even more
8781562 we had a presence before but it wasnt giving us the return on investment
8781563 melbourne is a different kettle of fish to sydney this will double our business in the next six to 12 months
8781564 we see the benefit in combining our resources were leveraging each others strengths and making a better and stronger entity
8781565 this will mean more products for customers and better pre and post sales service
8781566 what were trying to achieve is to work closely with our existing suppliers and develop new relationships with vendors
8781567 our cloud based delivery model offers our customers rapid deployment and compelling economics
8781568 the potential downside is that cisco isnt known as a software company and completing the technology integration might be challenging for them
8781569 the on premises market is quite competitive and exchange is well entrenched which is why cisco may want to offer it only as a service
8781570 it is the only exchange alternative that does not require a plug in to work with outlook and its admin and licensing costs tend to be lower than for exchange
8781571 these customers will look at webex connect and say this is scalable and secure and better than any it infrastructure i can put together and the cost differential is night and day
8781572 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8781573 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000
8781574 john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies all over again
8781575 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man
8781576 if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8781577 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve experienced in the history of humankind
8781578 not only in the heat of this election but in the aftermath as we put his agenda to work for our country

8781605 on the basis of the physical damage to the aircrafts forward cargo hold and cabin it is evident that the number 4 passenger oxygen cylinder sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurized contents julian walsh acting atsb executive director said today
8781606 the passengers were obviously very lucky atsb investigator julian walsh said in canberra
8781607 it was evident that one passenger oxygen cylinder had sustained a sudden failure and forceful discharge of its pressurised contents into the aircraft hold rupturing the fuselage in the vicinity of the wing fuselage leading edge fairing
8781608 the cylinder had been propelled upward by the force of the discharge puncturing the cabin floor and entering the cabin adjacent to the second main cabin door
8781609 the cylinder had subsequently impacted the door frame door handle and overhead panelling before falling to the cabin floor and exiting the aircraft through the ruptured fuselage
8781610 these oxygen bottles are actually quite robust so it would take some significant force to do some damage like that
8781611 theres nothing at this stage that the atsb can identify that could have been done to prevent this we dont really know why the bottle failed thats the key question for the investigation
8781612 anythings possible its certainly a rare event but no one can discount the possibility of those sort of things happening mr walsh said
8781613 as far as we can tell from all the information thats available to us the crew have pretty much done a textbook response mr walsh said
8781614 the government has written to all 20 internet service providers and i expect we will be blocked by all of them within the next few days there is strong pressure from the government to do so

8781639 it is information that is more restricted in time and does not have confirmatory laboratory findings behind it
8781640 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
8781641 let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey and especially the one who traveled the farthest
8781642 to the love of my life our next first lady michelle obama and to sasha and malia i love you so much and im so proud of all of you
8781643 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8781644 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8781645 thats why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8781646 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8781647 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition thats beyond your reach
8781648 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8781649 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8781650 this country is more decent than one where a woman in ohio on the brink of retirement finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work
8781651 this country is more generous than one where a man in indiana has to pack up the equipment hes worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to china and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news
8781652 we are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty that sits on its hands while a major american city drowns before our eyes
8781653 tonight i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough
8781654 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time
8781655 the truth is on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives
8781656 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans
8781657 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8781658 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
8781659 well its time for them to own their failure its time for us to change america
8781660 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8781661 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma
8781662 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8781663 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8781664 because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from iraq and afghanistan i see my grandfather who signed up after pearl harbor marched in pattons army and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the gi bill
8781665 in the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift i think about my mom who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships
8781666 when i listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down i remember all those men and women on the south side of chicago who i stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed
8781667 and when i hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business i think about my grandmother who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman
8781668 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8781669 its a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect
8781670 its a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create american jobs look out for american workers and play by the rules of the road
8781671 ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves
8781672 our government should work for us not against us it should help us not hurt us it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every american whos willing to work
8781673 thats the promise of america the idea that we are responsible for ourselves but that we also rise or fall as one nation the fundamental belief that i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper
8781674 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8781675 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8781676 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8781677 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8781678 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8781679 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8781680 washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8781681 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8781682 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power
8781683 now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world class education because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy
8781684 now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable accessible health care for every single american
8781685 now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave because nobody in america should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent
8781686 now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws so that your pensions are protected ahead of ceo bonuses and the time to protect social security for future generations
8781687 and now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal days work because i want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons
8781688 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow
8781689 and democrats we must also admit that fulfilling americas promise will require more than just money
8781690 individual responsibility and mutual responsibility thats the essence of americas promise
8781691 and just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home so must we keep americas promise abroad if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8781692 for while senator mccain was turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 i stood up and opposed this war knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face
8781693 and today as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration even after we learned that iraq has a 79 billion surplus while were wallowing in deficits john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8781694 thats not the judgment we need that wont keep america safe we need a president who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past
8781695 you dont defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying iraq
8781696 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8781697 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan
8781698 these are the policies i will pursue and in the weeks ahead i look forward to debating them with john mccain
8781699 but what i will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
8781700 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook
8781701 so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8781702 we may not agree on abortion but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country
8781703 i know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk
8781704 and you know what its worked before because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government when washington doesnt work all its promises seem empty if your hopes have been dashed again and again then its best to stop hoping and settle for what you already know
8781705 i get it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8781706 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8781707 for eighteen long months you have stood up one by one and said enough to the politics of the past
8781708 i believe that as hard as it will be the change we need is coming
8781709 this country of ours has more wealth than any nation but thats not what makes us rich we have the most powerful military on earth but thats not what makes us strong our universities and our culture are the envy of the world but thats not what keeps the world coming to our shores
8781710 instead it is that american spirit that american promise that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain that binds us together in spite of our differences that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen but what is unseen that better place around the bend
8781711 and it is that promise that forty five years ago today brought americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington before lincolns memorial and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream
8781712 the men and women who gathered there couldve heard many things they couldve heard words of anger and discord they couldve been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred
8781713 but what the people heard instead people of every creed and color from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8781714 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8781715 it was gods way of proving that if we sin and go against his word he will exact revenge
8781716 first thing id do as president is to go to see the speaker of the house and the majority leader of the senate i assume that that would be sen
8781717 the best thing about this tournament is that it is just so amazingly diverse
8781718 its a real celebration of all different races and nationalities
8781719 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of u can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american watch video of obamas invesco speech view updated street closures alternative route info view street closures and protest parade route for aug 25 27 view protest parade route for thursday aug 28 webcams four of them on downtown denver family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8781720 one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8781721 we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight
8781722 what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time
8781723 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8781724 that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
8781725 in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is youre on your own
8781726 out of work tough luck no health care the market will fix it born into poverty pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you dont have boots youre on your own
8781727 protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education
8781728 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution
8781729 we will keep our promise to every young american if you commit to serving your community or your country we will make sure you can afford a college education
8781730 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8781731 i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9 11 and made clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights
8781732 finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan
8781733 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8781734 what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
8781735 at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future
8781736 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain sen obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way
8781737 the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president

8781839 eclipse is an important lively and healthy project with an enormous plug in and developer community that uses an otherwise duplicative licence they arent interested in using the bsd or other open source licences that are readily combinable with epl code

8781841 in his address to the approximately 95 guests at the fundraiser rosenberg called the current board elections
8781842 to elect people who have never been near this union never served on a committee know nothing about negotiations and to replace valuable people it would be absolutely a tragedy

8781901 opening with the perfect foreshadowing device a summary of the legend of st valentine author jamieson wolf sets the reader up for an erotic supernatural romp thats going to have meaning the story valentine is fast paced and well told and offers not just a quick and lusty romance but a storyline that makes the reader sympathize with the characters plights and care about the point wolf wishes to make
8781902 i like this writers way with words valentine is an amazing book that everyone shoul read he builds a good plot and develops his characters well i would give it 5 stars out of 5
8781903 jamieson wolf writes with some of the strongest emotion i have found in ages his passion is reminiscent of that seen in the works of shakespeare and others of that time period his characters love deeply and without restraint overcoming every obstacle placed before them this is truly a tale for all those who believe love has no boundaries
8781904 jamieson wolf is what i would call a fabulous storyteller he dreams up or gets visited by great characters and he paints them vividly when he writes he gets fantastic story ideas and pounds them out in a way that makes you lean in toward the computer screen or flip through the physical pages faster and faster to see whats happening to these people next
8781905 this book is great this is a must read book for any body who loves ghost fantasy supernatural fun a surprise around every corner awaits the reader i am so happy to have purchased this book and add it to my own family library we just have to wait until jamieson wolf gets another fun book out there for all of us to read well worth it for your own fun reading and for your book collection a five star rating from me love it

8781917 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president

8781995 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8781996 one of the biggest tests heading into the convention was if the democratic party could unify itself and at least in that sense it seems to have been very successful
8781997 bill and hillary clinton were crucial to this and they seemed to have not only reconciled themselves to barack obamas candidacy but they appeared to have some genuine enthusiasm about it
8781998 let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey and especially the one who travelled the farthest a champion for working americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours hillary rodham clinton
8781999 i was really disappointed in both of the clintons from february until hillarys speech at the convention this week
8782000 i really feel she was being sincere and even though bill looked disappointed during her speech he redeemed himself with his own speech both of them were very clear in telling people that they must vote democrat in this election regardless of the candidate and i was so glad they said that
8782001 i was disheartened to see men standing in the top two spots at the convention yet again
8782002 it seems to me that the democratic party has some serious work to do in terms of selecting the most viable candidate and taking on that other ism sexism that being said i will vote for obama because i feel i have to as a democrat hillarys speech reaffirmed my decision to do so
8782003 ratings have increasingly declined for conventions as they became less important over the years and no real news emerged from them
8782004 you get people tuning in but those are mostly the people who are decided voters you have to wonder if the people who have the most concerns about barack obama even bothered to watch the democrats need to win the independents and the undecided voters to take the white house and those people likely werent even watching this convention
8782005 reagan had to work hard to make voters feel more comfortable with him it wasnt one moment one electrifying speech at the convention it really was a long drawn out process

8782007 almost everything about supermarket shopping in the uk is wrong for elderly customers from shelving that is too high to reach or too low to get to the kaiser store was the first of its kind in germany and is so impressive
8782008 the trolleys on their own are lighter and easier to move the signs are very clear there are magnifying glasses on shelves and trolleys the lighting is better and the staff friendlier with a growing elderly population this has to be the future for supermarkets
8782009 theres always a hazard its not the same as loose ammunition but a raffle barrel heats up and becomes just like a weapon fired
8782010 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it its a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create american jobs look out for american workers and play by the rules of the road i will make certain those health care companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws so that your pensions are protected ahead of ceo bonuses
8782011 change happens because the american people demand it because they
8782012 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the judgment and temperament to be commander in chief that is a debate i welcome

8782023 he likes the west coast offense and a very aggressive style of play on defense that has their safeties very involved and on the move with blitzes etc he will play for the best defensive mind
8782024 taylor said he likes the small town life better than the big city life and that the nebraska system fits him well on either side of the ball
8782025 he likes the west coast offense and a very aggressive style of play on defense that has their safeties very involved and on the move with blitzes etc
8782026 defensively which is where taylor thinks he will play he will play for the best defensive mind in college football bo pelini who has put out numerous safeties into the nfl
8782027 he likes the fact that they will have coaching stability considering that this is a new coaching staff and the fact that tom osborne is actively involved and committed to bringing nebraska back to a national championship caliber team
8782028 taylor also liked the down to earth unpretentious personality of the coaches especially coach pelini who is a disciplinarian that coaches with integrity
8782029 in athletics nebraska has more academic all americans than any other college second is
8782030 nebraska would like taylor to come on his official visit during a bye week
8782031 i would say second to nebraska would have been between
8782032 this is a solid commitment from taylor and he believes in his heart that this is where he wants to play and who he wants to play for
8782033 free safety will most likely be the position that he will play and he is excited to play for one of the top defensive minds in the country
8782034 if need be taylor has the ability to run the style of offense that nebraska runs west coast and accept the challenge to compete with anyone for that position if thats where the coaches feel that he can best help the team
8782035 it will be hard to find a better fit for taylor and we considered many of the top programs who will possibly offer him during the course of the season but he is convinced this is where he wants to play
8782036 as a family we thought that he should commit to the school of his choice once he has done his due diligence on the other schools that he really liked through visits research etc

8782079 he likes to say hell follow osama to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives

8782092 bidens job was to introduce six ordinary americans many of them republicans
8782093 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight
8782094 i stand before you tonight not as a republican or a democrat but as an american
8782095 today the divisions in our country are deep and wide
8782096 and we have knowingly saddled our children and grandchildren with a staggering debt this is a moral failing not just a financial one
8782097 i believe barack obama has the energy but more important the temperament to lead this country
8782098 promises to appoint more antonin scalias and clarence thomases and end a womans right to choose
8782099 i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8782100 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheny white house and promising to actually continue them hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
8782101 anything else um yesterday i got a new collar for shiloh since she snapped her old one on the tie out her new collar is wider and camouflage

8782110 by largely freeing the company from the price hedging shackles and the tie to west texas intermediate wti prices rather than much more profitable tapis spot prices we look forward to a further handsome revenue and cash flow boost in the current year
8782111 for instance up to 90 of our oil sales are available to be sold into the spot price oil market mostly at tapis plus a premium in the current december half at prices considerably higher than beach would have realised under its now dispensed with oil hedge obligations
8782112 while our divestment of further 10 in the bmg project allowed beach to capture value and seek out other opportunities we have still been able to increase our reserves over the year by 62 to 145 million barrels of oil equivalent mmboe
8782113 the divestments of portions of our holding in the bmg project was largely offset by an increase of 8 5 mmboe in our cooper eromanga basin reserves the bulk of which was oil at highly profitable prices
8782114 in addition our agreement to acquire a 20 interest for us 110 million in the north shadwan concession in the gulf of suez is expected to yield a net increase in beachs reserves of a further 8 mmb through three oil fields that we expect to develop with bp as operator over the next year or two
8782115 elsewhere the immediate outlook for drilling includes three potentially high impact exploration wells offshore from victoria and tasmania with two rigs now contracted to accelerate additional exploration delineation and development wells in the bmg project
8782116 subject to the approval of the egyptian authorities we expect to be involved in a variety of activities in the gulf of suez starting in the latter half of 2008
8782117 this activity includes an oil appraisal well in the burtocal oil field planning for development of this and two other oil field discoveries in adjacent waters and an exploration oil well further north in the gulf on the july south prospect adjacent to bps saqqara oil field which came on stream in may 2008 at a reported rate of 30 000 bopd
8782118 a drilling rig has been secured to drill a paralana geothermal well in early 2009 and cooper eromanga basin drilling is expected to continue apace
8782119 we are delighted to report on the significant progress made by the company during the last financial year mesoblasts significant achievements together with its continued strong financial health underpin the ongoing progress towards successful commercial outcomes in the near term

8782128 so those forms of selenium will differ in their capacity to change someones antioxidant status and capacity to prevent cancer
8782129 it just so happens that when you feed selenium to cows and they produce selenium enriched milk the selenium seems to be in a chemical form that is both highly absorbable into the body and also more effective in terms of preventing cancer
8782130 we are comparing the milk form of selenium with a yeast form of selenium in this human study and looking to see how readily the selenium gets into the body
8782131 we are also taking biopsies from the lining of the bowel to make certain that the selenium is being delivered to the cells lining the bowel if we can establish that is occurring then we will be more confident that selenium is going to regulate the cells lining the bowels in humans

8782135 barack obamas speech tonight laid out his specific bold solutions and optimistic vision for our nation and our childrens future
8782136 his speech crystallized the clear choice between he and senator mccain four more years of the same failed policies or a leader who can tackle the great challenges we face revitalizing our economy and restoring our standing in the world i am proud to support senator obama our next president of the united states and joe biden our next vice president of the united states

8782148 we are all nintendo warriors today remember that game that electronic game a few years ago push buttons zim zam boom and it was all over with that is not the way you fight war although we as a society have grown to believe that
8782149 while we are democrats and republicans in our hearts we are all idahoans
8782150 one of the hardest things weve had to do here is taking off our party hats
8782151 this is outrageous the people of idaho are entitled to have their representatives base their votes on the merits of a bill not on who backed the loser in a speakers contest
8782152 there was one of those six projects that was removed altogether why because the senator and the representatives from that district were from the wrong political party we need to take a step back
8782153 im prepared to bid for that first ticket to shoot a wolf myself

8782168 when we talked about an open convention this is what democrats meant
8782169 the carbon based interests oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and theyre drilling it for everything its worth
8782170 some of the best marketers have the worst products and this is certainly true of todays republican party
8782171 im pam and wait till you hear what happened to me
8782172 john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is youre on your own out of work tough luck no health care the market will fix it born into poverty pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you dont have boots youre on your own
8782173 google is interested in collecting the highest quality satellite imagery available and as a symbol of this commitment has agreed to put the company logo on the first stage of our launch vehicle
8782174 we wanted to reward people who have gone above and beyond the call of duty
8782175 we decided early on not to play that game and really stuck with everybody getting the same
8782176 if you are going to reward a school reward the whole school community
8782177 the driver told me that the man came out of nowhere he just walked out into the street
8782178 his head smashed through her windshield and clashed against her head
8782179 i told him hold on you are going to be all right
8782180 he was a nice guy who would pump gas or panhandle for spare change this is a real shame
8782181 but after i told them about the cause they got excited and promised to read more
8782182 im not interested in doing the least amount of work for this job
8782183 im interested in being a mentor and a role model ideally i want to inspire kids to one day take part in charitable work too
8782184 sueli has been an asset to this community the second she stepped into his library
8782185 she is always encouraging kids to read and stressing how crucial it is to keep your mind active
8782186 how we think about licenses is getting a bit more nuanced
8782187 eclipse is an important lively and healthy project with an enormous plug in and developer community that uses an otherwise duplicative license they arent interested in using the bsd or other open source licenses that are readily combinable with epl code
8782188 we have decided that after nearly 2 years of operation that it was time to add the epl and serve these open source developers
8782189 m wants to know if i can come out and play
8782190 i told them we arent allowed to but they keep asking
8782191 well you should respect grandmas wishes and not watch that when shes around
8782192 i am being politically persecuted by those defeated yesterday in a just and necessary war
8782193 the ones we defeated abandoned their armed struggle and morphed into peaceful civilians
8782194 nobody can free their homeland by killing their fellow countrymen
8782195 people of every creed and color from every walk of life
8782196 is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8782197 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8782198 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8782199 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8782200 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8782201 i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8782202 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8782203 the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8782204 i get it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
8782205 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8782206 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8782207 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our
8782208 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8782209 on november 4 we must stand up and say eight is enough
8782210 the experience lincolns supporters valued most was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse

8782212 and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition

8782217 i feel were at a tipping point and the energy youre feeling in this room can literally cause change
8782218 i wish he had been here to see this because this is what he wanted
8782219 we never thought wed see this an african american nominated for president
8782220 this is a watershed moment in american politics tonight proved that barack obama is a once in a generation candidate
8782221 would people really rather have mr 894 out of 899 than
8782222 saya ingin tahu habitat aslinya orangutan dan syukur syukur bisa melihat langsung
8782223 para ahli memperkirakan populasi orangutan di betung kerihun sekitar 2 400 ekor berdasarkan ketersediaan pangan tapi hasil survei kami di lapangan di antaranya dengan melihat sarang diperkirakan jumlahnya 1 200 1 400 ekor
8782224 pernah kami melihat orangutan bertengkar memperebutkan pohon buah yang kalah akan menyingkir dan pemenang akan mendapatkan pohon buahnya
8782225 sekitar empat juta hektar hutan mengalami degradasi dengan perkiraan sekitar dua juta hektar menjadi perkebunan kelapa sawit dan selebihnya telantar
8782226 jika mendengar letusan senjata orangutan biasanya tidak mau kembali lagi dan mencari tempat lebih tenang padahal taman nasional secara tradisional telah menjadi jalur berburu babi bagi masyarakat sehingga agak sulit dilarang
8782227 bentuknya tidak mesti taman nasional tetapi tetap ada aturan perlindungannya jika tidak dikhawatirkan kedua taman nasional itu sulit bertahan warga sekitar hutan juga harus sejahtera sehingga mereka ikut menjaga hutan
8782228 theres no one ready willing and able to look after them
8782229 how we think about licenses is getting a bit more nuanced
8782230 eclipse is an important lively and healthy project with an enormous plug in and developer community that uses an otherwise duplicative license they arent interested in using the bsd or other open source licenses that are readily combinable with epl code
8782231 we have decided that after nearly 2 years of operation that it was time to add the epl and serve these open source developers

8782235 what you arent going to come say hi to me
8782236 a worldview based on the idea that important matters are esoteric in nature
8782237 if theres any day that a lot of people think christ might come its probably not going to be that day
8782238 therefore you also be ready for the son of man is coming at an hour you do not expect
8782239 but of that day and hour no one knows not even the angels of heaven but my father only
8782240 lord will you at this time restore the kingdom to israel
8782241 this is that last generation because its the only generation i have whether the lord comes or i die for me this is the end of time the last generation
8782242 the british capital cant match china for spending or flash it aims instead to emphasize fun at the 2012 summer olympics

8782255 i think were lucky to have the most recognizable and largest icon in all of sport playing ours
8782256 if tiger was not around and i was able to be the no 1 player in the world id be making half as much money as i am now because of him
8782257 i am very thankful for the fact that hes in our sport and hes had the success and the charisma and the lure to attract corporate america as well as fans to the game were all fortunate
8782258 the game of golf suffers when hes not in the field
8782259 it was a fun tournament last year i loved the opportunity to have won the tournament but i also love the way it happened with the opportunity to play three rounds with tiger
8782260 the opportunity to have one of the best fields in golf for these fedexcup events and to be able to come out on top was a lot of fun
8782261 ive played the same way ive played throughout the year i just havent been scoring the way i would like
8782262 even though i feel like im playing better the little shots around the greens have cost me but im starting to get that turned around and i expect to have a much better week this week
8782263 my decision to play here this week has been taken in many different ways
8782264 this was a personal decision to be here and a decision which really after missing the cut last week didnt leave me many other options
8782265 i need to try and play well this week so i can one play 15 events on the pga tour and two get into next week which is very important to try and get into the tour championship
8782266 i spent a couple of days thinking about whether i should go back to gleneagles
8782267 at one stage i had changed all six flights to fly back i then slept on it and woke up at 4 00 in the morning and took another look and i really felt like this was my best chance
8782268 was it the right decision im not sure you know it might have been a mistake but ive taken a personal decision and im not there im here and i have to stick by that
8782269 i have to take confidence out of my second place finish at the open four tournaments ago
8782270 its not as if it was four months ago or 10 months ago
8782271 if you look at my statistics over the last 12 months im 70 points in the world rankings ahead of paul casey and darren clarke
8782272 the daily show with von lohmann said that at least a dozen other video hosting web sites facing similar legal challenges should also be helped by the ruling
8782273 we respect mccains service and all but his policies are whack yo
8782274 i dont think senator mccain doesnt care about whats going on in the lives of americans i think he doesnt know
8782275 insane action and humongous aliens tied together by a twisted story
8782276 i find it extremely troubling that a parent would say the things he wrote in those messages
8782277 hes angry and ready for a fight he is innocent we will try this case it is nothing but a false accusation
8782278 after a very difficult 17 months i feel like i have finally been validated
8782279 i am relieved to find that even federal judges are not above the law and that sexual abuse in the workplace is never acceptable no matter the status of the offender
8782280 based on our discussions it was determined that it would probably be in dr paxtons best interest and the colleges best interest that he resign as president
8782281 we could have the most powerful anti hacking force in the world but wed still have no computers so we couldnt do anything
8782282 the government thinks about guns tanks and raiding houses hackers just arent a priority
8782283 now the government is starting to use computers everywhere but these computers arent protected
8782284 if that information had fallen into the hands of terrorists it would have been a catastrophe
8782285 im going for maximum death and destruction in the work place
8782286 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8782287 but who can endure the day of his coming and who can stand when he appears
8782288 a couple of years ago i was like you know enough of this i dont need it it was literally something that happened one morning like yknow fuck that i was very impressed with noel gallagher as you know im an oasis fanatic and noel was like adopts stentorian tone you know what no more cocaine and i thought if he can do it everybody else can do it i had my fun with it it was always more of a social thing we were never like rolling around and spending days in bathroom stalls and peeking out the keyholes of doors for days
8782289 banks should treat scottish customers more favourably than their english counterparts because the housing market in scotland is more resilient the snp housing minister has said
8782290 rates of colorectal cancer in various countries are strongly correlated with per capita consumption of red meat and animal fat and inversely associated with fibre consumption even the most dedicated animal scientist or meat supporter must be somewhat dismayed by the preponderance of evidence suggesting a role of meat consumption in the etiology of colon cancer
8782291 a low fat plant based diet would not only lower the heart attack
8782292 are all over the place in the brain lungs pancreas stomach liver adrenals and intestines the animals are a bloody mess
8782293 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back

8782312 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america uptake michael mcdonald america invesco field preview
8782313 the idea was to just bring him in when school started and see where it all sat
8782314 giorgio is an elite soccer player so he wasnt going to all the camps and combines but you look at his tape his senior year hes every bit as good as the other guys
8782315 whatever spare time i manage to squeeze around that i do my mac programs and iphone is now my new passion
8782316 in a weird way its down time for me even though im still working and still creating something
8782317 im uncertain whether i can share the specific numbers with you but i can tell you based on my web site blog downloads at least that there are at least 300 000 people who have downloaded flashlight and there may be more
8782318 take screen shots and not have to do much editing to post it online
8782319 i was looking at my programs in mac and thinking is there a way to translate these programs over to the iphone
8782320 ive had the experience and other people have too where youre in the dark and the one thing you happen to have with you is a cell phone so you flip it open and use the screen for whatever light you can get out of it to navigate around
8782321 eventually you could have links to sizes that you wanted and pictures of things you like online instead of drawing names out of a hat we would be drawing names out of a computer
8782322 isnt a phone so much as its a really small computer you put in your pocket
8782323 if you were to look at the market traditionally for that kind of device or any computer those small utility programs have a very wide audience they play to everyone would want one
8782324 he did like to have his four siblings be able to spend time and play together i think that was a motivator for him
8782325 programming the way i want to work in the way i want to
8782326 we have to understand that young people are generally good im sure we all made mistakes when we were young and it is important that we dont judge youngsters for understandable misdemeanours
8782327 there is a big difference between a young person who makes a mistake and gets in trouble and somebody who is persistently committing crime
8782328 we can use methods like fixed penalty notices and restorative justice to deal with problems without criminalising the individual involved
8782329 we also need to recognise that the vast majority of youngsters make a positive contribution and they should not be tarred with the same brush as the minority of persistent troublemakers who should continue to be dealt with robustly
8782330 there is a good deal of anecdotal evidence for example that behaviour particularly that of children and young people is being criminalised which arguably would be better dealt with informally school related misbehaviour for example and in previous times was
8782331 every other team on our schedule is a worthy talented opponent so we know every week is a fight for our lives but i think it helps our schedule
8782332 the more they learn about concussions theyll definitely be cautious with it safe and cautious
8782333 we discount freddies presentation about how it can stay above regulatory capital minimums come hell or high water
8782334 weve obviously provided you with an extraordinary amount of information but im not going to apologize for that
8782335 as much information as you could possibly need to come to your own best view of what the future may hold
8782336 any time somebody says that they committed a murder we are going to take that seriously
8782337 we have no way of knowing whether or not richard cooey is just blowing smoke and making things up or whether he did in fact did kill somebody else more than 20 years ago
8782338 we would be happy to sit down and talk to her
8782339 shes using my daughter people never even knew who samantha ronson was until she met lindsay she was just some l a dj and now shes writing a book i am at wits end with this stuff this is not in lindsays best interest
8782340 pardon the lack of my imagination but i do need a picture or stimulating graphic to aid my mental disability to imagine
8782341 we need a president who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past
8782342 as a former hillary clinton supporter i thought her speech was superb but recognize my subjectivity but for most of the people ive talked to barack obama supporters as well they felt very good about it
8782343 y ou care about your health care you want health insurance you want to be able to afford that health insurance thats a uniting principle you care about the ability to get a job and to raise a family you care about affordable housing or housing that is affordable you care about good quality public education you care about the environment maybe for different reasons youre a hunter maybe youre a fisherman maybe youre someone that just loves going out in the kayak and youre starting to say the seasons arent changing like they used to i think these are uniting principles and these are the principles that have always defined the greatness of our democratic party when we have the courage and the authenticity to stand on principle and advance solutions to these challenges
8782344 w e have a governor and a democratic legislature that cant even get a budget passed its an embarrassment and frankly the backdrop of my experience at the convention is what the heck is wrong with california
8782345 there are a lot of good things happening in my city including the fact that were the only city in the united states of america doing universal health care innovative policy not the rhetoric not the ideal actual implementation a city that has the most progressive environmental policies in the country on solar alternative fuels on energy generation that is growing the economy at the same time creating workforce for the future and a city where headquartered companies from around the world want to establish a presence
8782346 separation is not a core construct or a value that this country should embrace it has in the past but brown v board of education reconciled that and for any democrat with respect to stand on the principles of brown v board of education and celebrate its 54 55 year history and then hold the line on that but not do the same for the lgbt community i think is short sighted and mistaken separate is not equal i think people will look back on the issue of lgbt rights and extend the same curiosity 40 years from now and say are you kidding what was the big deal lets move on and focus on real issues not these issues that tend to divide
8782347 cuando yo ten a seis a os vi una vez una l mina magn fica en un libro sobre el bosque virgen que se llamaba historias vividas representaba a una serpiente boa que se tragaba a una fiera
8782348 es muy conocido y se ha versionado infinidad de veces pero ahora sesenta a os despu s de que fuese escrito queremos acercarnos a l de otra manera e intentar verlo con otros ojos al principito le gusta valorar el desierto no por la vasta extensi n de arena que se ve sino por la infinidad de pozos de agua que encierra a nosotros nos gustar a que el espectador adulto o ni o vea esa cantidad de pozos de agua que el texto del principito encierra en s mismo
8782349 i just hope that after the lawyers pay themselves there will be enough left over to settle with those of us who lost a parent to this drug
8782350 takes the award i believe shes in training to take up barking at the moon as her next activity
8782351 well bob saget hands you a chocolate milk that he just made and you wake up three hours later lying on your stomach
8782352 a man should not let his intimidation by people prevent him from speaking the truth if he knows it witnesses it or hears it
8782353 if it is said that the one who has haya is shy to speak the truth causing him to leave off commanding the good and forbidding the bad and that his haya leads him to shortcomings in fulfilling some obligations as is normally the case i say that this is not true haya rather it is incompetence and weakness and subjugation and it is referred to as haya simply by way of likeness and simile true haya is only when the thing he has haya of doing is truly bad and there is no consideration for what the people consider to be bad when it is in fact something good or vice versa and it is established that the prophet had more haya than a virgin in the innermost portion of her home and he is an example for us in this with this there was nothing to prevent his anger if the limits of allah were violated
8782354 you were the last person who i feared would be overpowered by women i will not eat from your food or enter your homes
8782355 out of respect for the hadith that was narrated to us from the prophet
8782356 i heard mubarak bin fudalah say that he heard from al hasan that the messenger of allah said
8782357 yes ask me what you want as i have made a pact with allah at the maqam of ibrahim that i would do three things i i will speak the truth if i am asked a question ii i will remain patient if i am tested and iii i will be thankful if i am spared
8782358 you are from the enemies of allah on earth you violate honor and kill based on suspicion
8782359 what do you say about abd al malik bin marwan
8782360 he is worse than you and you are simply one of his many mistakes
8782361 let him go and throw him out into the marketplace
8782362 i will not leave until you all come out to the prayer
8782363 i am carrying al baqarah in my chest either politely be quiet or get out
8782364 whenever i see something that i should speak up about and fail to do so i urinate blood
8782365 i performed the hajj with sufyan and he would come and go with his tongue never ceasing to command the good and forbid the evil
8782366 o aba abdillah this is my ring work for this nation according to the quran and the sunnah
8782367 do you permit me to speak o commander of the believers can i speak with your promise not to harm me
8782368 do not send for me again until i come to you myself and do not give me anything unless i ask you for something
8782369 what made you refuse he only asked you to work according to the quran and sunnah
8782370 i was unable to look at sufyan out of haya and intimidation from him
8782371 fear allah you are in this position and have this power due to the swords of the muhajirin and ansar and their sons are dying of hunger umar made the hajj and spent only fifteen dinars and he used to shade himself under the trees
8782372 no just be below what you are and above what i am
8782373 i never saw anyone with a more confrontational face for the sake of allah than sufyan
8782374 a little learning is a dangerous thing drink deep or taste not the pierian spring
8782375 we like the simple user interface and web based analysis software of autodesk green building studio
8782376 it allows even our less technically inclined members of the firm to analyze their designs and make decisions regarding energy usage early in the design process when it can have the greatest impact and it prompts early collaboration with our mep partners as well

8782378 senator mccain has always been sensitive to national crises in the 2000 race he postponed his announcement because of the situation in the balkans and we are monitoring the situation very closely
8782379 the republicans cant seem to get a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
8782380 it is not just that the american side could not restrain the georgian leadership from this criminal act the american side in effect armed and trained the georgian army
8782381 why spend years holding difficult negotiations and looking for complicated compromises in ethnic conflicts its easier to arm one of the parties and push it to kill the other party and the job is done
8782382 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president
8782383 lets hope we do not see any direct confrontation in that
8782384 the decision to deliver aid using nato battleships is something that hardly can be explained its not a common practice
8782385 the russian president medvedev says he is not afraid of a new cold war we dont want one he has a big responsibility not to start one
8782386 the convention stipulates a limited number of vessels he said
8782387 police are able to target these drivers with the assistance of the public and using unmarked police vehicles
8782388 this group appeared to have arranged this meet which was quickly shut down by police
8782389 the cylinder had been propelled upward by the force of the discharge puncturing the cabin floor and entering cabin adjacent to the second main cabin doors
8782390 the cylinders been propelled up with significant force to do the damage that it has and its happened very quickly so it probably would have been a matter of seconds
8782391 these oxygen bottles are actually quite robust so it would take some significant force to do some damage like that
8782392 theres nothing at this stage that the atsb can identify that could have been done to prevent this we dont really know why the bottle failed thats the key question for the investigation
8782393 anythings possible its certainly a rare event but no one can discount the possibility of those sort of things happening
8782394 i can confirm that mike carltons agreement as a contributor to saturdays sydney morning herald has been terminated after he refused to file as normal his column for saturdays morning paper
8782395 its my understanding that mike was unprepared to write during the strike
8782396 its got nothing to do with the radio station hell be back on monday
8782397 this is an indication again that the new regime at fairfax media is embarking on a low quality approach to journalism
8782398 the management prepared to trample on anyone who gets in their way and the people who will lose out in this case are the sydney morning herald readers
8782399 when youre alive you wanna hang on your hunk o blue thats all everybodys got in the world
8782400 d ont get yourself in too deep im liable to be all steam about you today and washed up tomorrow
8782401 im not afraid anymore you can never leave me now even if you go away ive got you now youre a prisoner inside of me
8782402 that frank borzage had a way with actors he made you believe your part and this intensity came over on the screen the story was a trifle but we loved it i proved i could really act with that one
8782403 he dont like anything touching his skin not to be clean
8782404 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8782405 i opened the newspaper and got sick to my stomach
8782406 i felt like i wanted to vomit when i seen that the reason why i called him a sellout is because i feel he did that for a publicity look rather than the issues that are affecting his people that look up to him how could you want john mccain in office when george bush and the republicans already have half a million people losing their homes in foreclosure were fighting an unjust war its the latinos and black kids up in the frontlines fighting that war we over here trying to take the troops out of iraq and bring peace this guy immediately wants war if not with iraq or afghanistan hell start a new one with iran i feel real disgusted that daddy yankee would do that either he did that for a look or hes just not educated on politics
8782407 democratic political consultant garry south who has signed on with newsom said gubernatorial hopefuls are also inspired by the attention they receive at the national convention and the chance to schmooze with wealthy donors from around the country
8782408 it was in response to the schwarzenegger administrations aborted plans to use aerial spraying to control the light brown apple moth in the san francisco and monterey areas
8782409 insurance commissioner steve poizner said wednesday hes planning to make a new green automobile insurance option known as
8782410 the state board of equalization which tracks gasoline and diesel sales said the drop in diesel use reflects the impacts of higher prices and less freight movement in a slowing economy
8782411 the securities and exchange commission on wednesday fined a california hedge fund manager and newsletter publisher 100 000 over claims he misled people into investing 20 million in two fraudulent real estate firms
8782412 an investigation into whether the death was in fact related to the virus is ongoing
8782413 we have been meeting and working with the community to address concerns
8782414 this clearly indicates that the market is not what it was
8782415 two years ago youd be pressed to find an apartment that sold for less than its purchase price
8782416 everyones saying the luxury market is so hot but something like that sends a signal that maybe it isnt
8782417 its definitely something new in a really hot market this wouldnt happen
8782418 if youre not priced appropriately its not going to sell
8782419 the market condition story of manhattan has been clouded by the inclusion of a high concentration of new developments into the housing stock
8782420 when you talk about resale its very hard to make the case that the typical apartment today is worth more than it was six months ago
8782421 its a broad based sample suggesting its not an anomaly
8782422 were very lucky given what the rest of the country is going through
8782423 if you think you were going to make a big profit its going to be a disappointment
8782424 if youre going to buy something on the other end you can do well
8782425 the bottom line is that to build this water plant the taxpayers are getting soaked
8782426 the need to complete important projects like the water plant has not diminished
8782427 we cant sit back and let others worry about the future
8782428 i have never understood how putting a building underground is cheaper than putting a building aboveground
8782429 all other things being equal it may be more expensive to have the plant underground than at the surface level but it wasnt all other things being equal the length of tunneling that was required at the respective sites was a significant factor
8782430 the new industrial and commercial abatement program includes significant changes to eligibility and benefit schedules that should slow the growth in foregone tax revenue that would have occurred under icip because of the incremental nature of both the old and new programs it will take many years for the city to fully realize those savings
8782431 we think that icap has made some strides in narrowing down the available commercial benefits for retail and it does in manhattan lower the amount of time that commercial properties have access to the subsidies but it still allows them the subsidy for 10 years and many of these are large midtown manhattan commercial firms that dont need the help and these are substantial buildings that would otherwise contribute a large amount to the tax base
8782432 gas is more expensive and ive been flying less so ive been having a lot more barbecues with friends here and going to a lot of outdoor concerts
8782433 you dont have to rent out studio space and its free publicity as well
8782434 warm enough for the peaches tomatoes and eggplants to grow but comfortable enough to hang out at the market
8782435 a lot of time it will be a more humid sultry kind of temperature up near 90 degrees or more this year there has been bit more of a canadian influence which makes it more pleasant

8782467 when i first moved into my present place i only closed the blinds when i was about to go to bed but then heidi came over once and it was evening and dark outside and she asked me to close the blinds i thought it weird because it was only 7pm but then she said she didnt like people looking in from the outside and her not being able to see anything ever since then ive closed my blinds whenever it gets dark
8782468 we did not kill up to 90 civilians as has been alleged
8782469 ive seen the account stated from both the u n and certainly from the afghan government ive also seen it discussed that in fact that didnt happen
8782470 we know that when collateral damage occurs that it really does set us back so we work exceptionally hard to make sure that doesnt happen
8782471 were looking to do that as rapidly as we can
8782472 i am certainly willing to do that they are the ones that elected me
8782473 if other municipalities would like to approach their voters separately they have that prerogative
8782474 ive never seen members of our community stressed so much about their personal financial situations as they are right now
8782475 the timing is terrible raising taxes in a recession is never a good idea
8782476 i would dearly love to be able to tell you what to cut i dont know what to tell you
8782477 it is not melodramatic to convince our community about this ballot initiative
8782478 2008 will be a very good year as good as last year and perhaps even better
8782479 it all depends on politicians but i think they will be here for a long time
8782480 we stayed away but now we have nowhere else to go we could not stay with relatives forever
8782481 at first we lived in fear and panic when the tanks and the militias came and burned some of the houses
8782482 now i am afraid they will never leave and life will never be what it was
8782483 it is hard for me to say it but it will take an enormous effort to get our territory back even beyond abkhazia and south ossetia
8782484 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8782485 irish rock trio the script is expected to explode from the studio to the charts in the same way one republic put songwriter and producer ryan teddy on the map
8782486 we cry is the kind of song you fall in love with thanks to its sweet melody killer chorus and odonoghues ageless voice
8782487 a lot of these older records were made for vinyl so a lot of the frequencies were cut out because there were certain sounds you couldnt put on records this was a good chance to get them back up to scratch because now we can make them as loud and big sounding as we want with all the added depth using the original master tapes its the audiophile nerd side of us that accounts for some of that
8782488 make no mistake john mccain may pay hundreds of dollars for his shoes but were the ones who will pay for his flip flops
8782489 john mccain says that hell follow ubl to the gates of hell but he wont follow him to his cave
8782490 at some point hes got to tell us how he plans
8782491 john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change

8782500 and let us not grow weary in well doing for in
8782501 the lord has chosen called and armed us for the fight and shall we wish to be excused shall we not rather rejoice that we have the honor to appear in such a cause under such a captain such a banner and in such a company a complete suit of armor is provided weapons not to be resisted and precious balm to heal us if we receive a wound and precious ointment to revive us when we are close to fainting further we are assured of the victory beforehand and what a crown is prepared for every conqueror jesus the righteous judge the gracious savior shall place the crown upon every faithful head with his own hand let us not be weary and faint for in due season we shall reap

8782504 but we dont want this thing swept under the rug we still have a lot of people out there hurting
8782505 everybody agrees that this went on way too long and was unfocused and that the publics health was not served
8782506 none of us can give a cast iron guarantee that salmonella saintpaul wont reemerge
8782507 just like enjoying the moment and i will see whats going to happen next
8782508 im just happy to be back on track without pain i had a lot of mis hits on my forehand i think it also shows a little bit lack of practice and lack maybe of confidence in that area
8782509 i thought she was maybe more nervous than i was
8782510 if she wanted to stay no 1 at the end of this tournament she had to do well maybe she had a lot of pressure
8782511 that was the biggest win for clemson since the 82 orange bowl
8782512 everybody loves her shes the one we want to follow her steps
8782513 i dont realize yet that i beat the no 1 in the world
8782514 i dont realize that i played at the big court i dont know how im going to sleep tonight i dont know its just maybe tomorrow i will be i will i dont know when i will realize everything
8782515 he didnt want to hear my opinions this was tough when a coach doesnt want to hear a players opinion even if im wrong but at least he can listen and then we can discuss and not always say his opinion i think this is the reason why we started to fight a lot on the court
8782516 if im not going to win id certainly love for him to win and do well
8782517 i dont want to lose if that answers your question
8782518 you know in the third round for a place in the fourth round of the biggest tournament of the year i think well probably put our friendship aside for just a couple of hours
8782519 like when i lose you know filleted fish kind of thingfried fish its easy when i lose because you throw one of those two out there i tend to see those a lot
8782520 i thought i hit the ball from the back of the court very well i didnt feel like i was making many mistakes from the baseline not too many unforced errors
8782521 it doesnt make me start looking into the semis quarterfinals because i only made the quarterfinals of a slam once
8782522 im not good enough to be able to do that

8782532 that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8782533 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8782534 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know why else would he define middle class as someone making under five million dollars a year
8782535 when john mccain said we could just muddle through in afghanistan i argued for more resources and more troops john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8782536 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8782537 promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family

8782539 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination

8782555 so what is the secret i want to share it is something i call the hubris index an internal and on going process of weighing and measuring the size and affect of our ego the hubris index governs not only our attitude but also our behavior are we excessively proud and boastful do we fail to listen to people that tell us were wrong do we refuse to get feedback about the outcome of our acts and decisions and are we lax in planning in advance for possible problems consequences and corrective measures the humble heart
8782556 no i wasnt lucky i worked hard to achieve the goals i set for myself
8782557 the fire was a real blow but you learn what you need to do to keep going and then you do it
8782558 i think the fact that i was born without a father and that i spent a lifetime trying to put together a picture of one also had a lot to do with how i turned out
8782559 good and not so good but i think on balance more good than bad

8782581 dont be fooled glaxosmithklines scare tactics are only concerned with protecting its profit not the health of people with hiv aids
8782582 basically in very short and lay terms an ad cannot be false cannot be misleading and must have what is called fair balance
8782583 ask your doctor if there are hiv medications with a low risk of diarrhea
8782584 theyre more or less fighting for market share at this point
8782585 one of the classic examples of that would be the pepsi challenge
8782586 from my perspective this is the way that gsk has always kind of handled things in the past
8782587 their modus operandi is always kind of to bash the competition and they do that in a number of ways
8782588 running jaws ads is just going to raise the anxiety level very high for people nervous about getting treatment this could put them over the edge
8782589 mai gindeste te te rugam dupa un concediu de o luna
8782590 what has it done or failed to do that fills you with dismay what is laudable what is ludicrous
8782591 there is something wrong with doing the same thing voting for republicans in 2008 and expecting different results do you want bushs 3rd term or true change
8782592 we believe that into the period of 2009 youll start to see economic growth picking up
8782593 if you go the forecasts which were released by the reserve bank in august you see growth by the june quarter 2009 improving to two and a quarter per cent and then by the end of next year to two and a half per cent
8782594 id much rather be up front about that with the australian people rather than pretending that its any different
8782595 its a big challenge and its been a big challenge frankly since day one
8782596 australia is not immune to whats going on around the world the key thing is what youre doing about it and our plan in response to that is to first of all make sure that we dont put further upwards pressure on inflation interest rates thats our 22 billion surplus
8782597 secondly to make sure were investing in the countrys long term productivity growth thats what were talking about the eduction revolution
8782598 thats the third part of our economic strategy for the future but its going to be tough i dont want to mislead people
8782599 our automotive retailing division performed very strongly through the year however we did see slowing towards the end of the financial year
8782600 revenue for automotive retailing rose by 52 7 to 3 0 billion and ebitda for the division rose by 64 7 to 96 1 million
8782601 importantly our ebitda margin in automotive retailing remains strong up 7 9 to 3 17 from 2 94 last year
8782602 a further factor is ahgs five fully developed revenue streams in automotive retailing new and used car sales replacement parts servicing and finance together with our strong manufacturer portfolio which provides the group with a degree of natural hedge against changes in consumer sentiment and economic conditions
8782603 our strict acquisition parameters have served us very well since listing on the asx 3 years ago and we see no reason to change now despite the range of opportunities available in the market
8782604 while there is no disguising the seriousness of the situation for the centro group we are making incremental steps towards stabilisation in a difficult environment
8782605 our fundamental task remains to secure long term debt restructuring and we will continue to work with our lending groups to achieve this goal
8782606 maintaining the underlying value of the business has been a major focus of the management team
8782607 the headline loss of 2 055 million does not reflect the operating performance of the group for the past financial year
8782608 after adding back the above items to the headline result the underlying earnings are 242 million
8782609 our tenants are heavily weighted toward necessity orientated retailers such as supermarkets and discount stores and it is these retailers that continue to perform solidly when economic conditions start to slow
8782610 the level of development activity has slowed with the current development program being 194 million
8782611 if my daughter ever grew up and married a vegetarian id never forgive her
8782612 the plea of guilty must attract a significant discounted penalty
8782613 she comes before the court as a significant figure in this state with a significant list of achievements
8782614 she regrets profoundly for having a low range bac blood alcohol concentration
8782615 but she is confident that this is a one off occurrence and it will not re occur
8782616 the hacc program provides many services to assist with daily activities that most people take for granted such as domestic chores help with dressing and grooming and access to the community
8782617 for frail older people or other people with a disability these tasks can be challenging
8782618 this assistance will allow people to continue to live their daily lives with friends and family with dignity
8782619 no evidence that he is at risk of committing further offences
8782620 i can confirm that mike carltons agreement as a contributor to saturdays sydney morning herald has been terminated after he refused to file as normal his column for saturdays morning paper
8782621 its my understanding that mike was unprepared to write during the strike
8782622 its got nothing to do with the radio station hell be back on monday
8782623 this is an indication again that the new regime at fairfax media is embarking on a low quality approach to journalism
8782624 the management prepared to trample on anyone who gets in their way and the people who will lose out in this case are the sydney morning herald readers
8782625 at this stage we are continuing to monitor the situation and maintaining a watching vigil
8782626 i will be in touch with the meaa today to see what the latest development is
8782627 we have a number of staff who are contractually exempt from industrial action
8782628 the plan is to continue to put out the newspapers absolutely as normal and we are well advanced in doing that
8782629 we see no concern in getting the papers out tonight saturday and sunday and monday and beyond if necessary
8782630 we have got a problem now with the company it is being run by people who dont have ink in their veins
8782631 and this latest act is basically bowing to the market and saying weve got a market downturn here and what do we do we reach for the knife
8782632 this is really a pretty brutal way of doing it
8782633 in discussion that weve had in the last couple of days theyve said not only the canberra bureaus of the two great newspapers are on the table but also so too are foreign bureaus at risk of closure
8782634 in any country today we have to look at the children
8782635 our daughter was a month old when we adopted her and it was just such a fun time and made us very close seeing what love and affection can do for little ones is really why i got so excited for hhi
8782636 saif met stallone on the sets of kambakkht ishq and got along like a house on fire while saif has my name on his forearm stallone has his wife jennifer flavins face tattooed on his arm and the hollywood actor told saif to do the same with my photo on his arm i told saif no way its very painful and its enough he has my name on his forearm
8782637 we have recently commenced proceedings against parties involved in the production and distribution of a movie entitled hari puttar
8782638 i think ive earned my holiday i was so nervous and tense before the release i couldnt sleep
8782639 every time a release is around the corner i put the desktop globe in front of my wife and tell her to pick a destination for a holiday if the film clicks i told my wife if my new film is a hit ill take her to monte carlo if it doesnt work well have to make do with mahabaleshwar
8782640 i had given a break to amit and now that my film is a hit hes claiming ive stolen his story does he have the proof for it this is what success does to people
8782641 why does martin luther king get a whole day what exactly did he do
8782642 john mccain says hes a maverick but hes voted with bush over 90 of the time
8782643 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8782644 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8782645 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8782646 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side i am so lucky to have known her loved her and been her partner in all things i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8782647 they spoke the unspeakable wrote the unthinkable and lived their lives as few before them ever had open and proud lesbians in 1950s america
8782648 sai quando sar invisibile potr passarti a trovare senza che nessuno mi noti non preoccuparti sar discreto non ti spaventer n verr a curiosare nella tua vita intima ma quando avrai bisogno io ci sar e un lavoro difficile molto difficile ma decisamente stimolante ogni tanto sono felice e sono il sogno fatto persona un sogno che si sostituisce allaltro in questo periodo il cammino verso linvisibilit mi ha condotto nel cuore della notte ed io fiducioso e luminoso accetto e obbedisco al mio destino perch la visibilit noiosa e volgare e soprattutto stancante lacerante
8782649 ma la visibilit anche una continua curiosit un continuo mutamento lessere se stessi il farsi conoscere linvisibilit la vedo come una maschera
8782650 anche linvisibilit sai come decidere di voler vivere la propria vita al contrario non pi allesterno ma allinterno per poter apprezzare tutto quello che ti sei precluso o che altri hanno impedito che tu vedessi finalmente potersi togliere una maschera della quale ti sei stancato essere se stessi e non come altri vogliono che tu sia conoscersi non farsi conoscere sottili ma fondamentali differenze
8782651 s ma a volte il togliere la maschera e diventare invisibili una scusa per sfuggire a qualcosa che si teme
8782652 il timore fa parte delle fondamenta della mia vita il timore intenso come un rispetto quasi divino per me gli altri e la vita in se stessa fuggire fa parte della vita uno dei meccanismi automatici della nostra natura voglio sfuggire a certe cose che non mi interessano pi per poterne vivere delle altre gioco con paura e coraggio partecipano da sempre alla mia esistenza comincio a preoccuparmi per il tuo sonno non sar meglio che tu riposi un po
8782653 sto bene mi stai facendo compagnia e sono piacevolmente emozionato ma non voglio pensare solo a me stesso e quando ad una cosa ci tengo ho imparato a curarla e a pormi dalla sua parte lultima cosa che voglio cacciarti
8782654 emozionato perch vivo emozionato perch felice emozionato perch attraversato da forti e piacevoli emozioni
8782655 think big think fast think ahead ideas are no ones monopoly
8782656 pursue your goals even in the face of difficulties and convert adversities into opportunities
8782657 meeting the deadlines is not good enough beating the deadlines is my expectation
8782658 we cannot change our rulers but we can change the way they rule us
8782659 cops threaten girl 23 to turn informant or face 5 yr jail term for posessing weed they give her 13k and tell her to buy drugs and a gun from dealers she never met shes dead now
8782660 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 chance on change
8782661 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8782662 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in
8782663 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8782664 obviously its a very proud moment for me to see this happen
8782665 the cylinder had been propelled upward by the force of the discharge puncturing the cabin floor and entering cabin adjacent to the second main cabin doors
8782666 the cylinders been propelled up with significant force to do the damage that it has and its happened very quickly so it probably would have been a matter of seconds
8782667 these oxygen bottles are actually quite robust so it would take some significant force to do some damage like that
8782668 theres nothing at this stage that the atsb can identify that could have been done to prevent this we dont really know why the bottle failed thats the key question for the investigation
8782669 anythings possible its certainly a rare event but no one can discount the possibility of those sort of things happening
8782670 i had to come and see him speak here it is historic
8782671 ive been texting my friends and family back home already to tell them im here and im going to call some of my older republican family members tonight when he speaks
8782672 it represents what our campaign has been about from the beginning which is this commitment to grass roots organizing and giving the average american the opportunity to get engaged in the political process
8782673 its a pretty good visual reminder of the kinds of people that sen obama believes are most important and the people who will be front and center in his own mind as he delivering this speech
8782674 they move their legs around to reposition their bodies so that when they do jump they will push themselves away from the looming threat
8782675 you should anticipate that theyre going to jump away from you so you should extend your swat in the direction of the flys anticipated motion
8782676 when you see a fly flitting around your hair or your potato salad you might see an annoyance
8782677 but in my lab you really see a marvelous machine arguably the most sophisticated flying device on the planet
8782678 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8782679 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8782680 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
8782681 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8782682 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8782683 one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8782684 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8782685 are there other significant services that will not run within this new browser
8782686 oi nutter thats not food thats some goats feces you stink
8782687 i was so engrossed in my character that i didnt even realize what i was doing
8782688 he who shall introduce into public affairs the principles of primitive christianity will change the face of the world
8782689 guilty as hel free as a bird america is a great country

8782717 if we dont make our presence known as the nonreligious then religion just wins by default
8782718 i think theres a relentless challenge to anything christian on the part of the minority who are atheistic and agnostic
8782719 the danger to the separation of church and state has never been greater

8782730 as australias largest home loan provider it makes good strategic sense to look at alternative investments in this industry that will continue to bring benefits to shareholders and consumers
8782731 the australian mortgage and housing industries are the backbone of the economy and the purchase of a home remains the largest single investment made by many consumers
8782732 as this market continues to develop a strategic investment in one of the market leading providers in this industry is a natural fit for the group

8782739 the weak result reflects a final bout of mortgage rate increases clashing with sharply higher fuel and food bills

8782773 some people would say maybe the number of violations are down well i dont think theyre down that dramatically other people will say well theyre not doing as much as they should
8782774 are we happy with where were at no from our standpoint the most significant reason would be significant staffing shortages that we have had since the start of the year into the fall of last year
8782775 so thats seven less people out there doing what we would normally have them doing
8782776 once we identify the best model were going to hopefully get that enforcement going on an ongoing and consistent basis
8782777 you cannot have a quota the minute you do that youre putting the officers and public in an unfair position because then youre looking at what quality of tickets you are writing when you know you have to write 10 that day
8782778 our no 1 priority is just doing whats best for the students
8782779 nobody likes to see a school their children are attending closing
8782780 it will be upsetting for them change always is but they do want whats best for their children
8782781 what we have to think about what is in the best interests of the community and no 1 is what is in the best interests of the kids in our building
8782782 once the parents feel that the writing is on the wall i think they are going to know what is best for the children
8782783 well certainly all work together as a community and myself as principal with the parents and all the stakeholders and come up with the best solution and hopefully it will make everybody happy
8782784 weve got about a dozen schools with a 100 or fewer kids trying to staff those trying to provide them with the programs that the curriculum dictates in the year 2008 is almost impossible at this point in time
8782785 something has to be done the status quo is not an option
8782786 theres a fearfulness from people that want their community schools want to keep them we understand that
8782787 speaker pelosis outrageous attempt to present what she considers the teaching of the catholic church regarding abortion is simply wrong and should be disregarded by every faithful catholic
8782788 the teachings of the church on abortion are consistent and unambiguous and it is very disturbing to hear someone who claims to be a catholic distort these teachings and sow seeds of confusion among the faithful by attempting to relativize the right to life
8782789 house speaker nancy pelosi stepped out of her political role and completely misrepresented the teaching of the catholic church in regard to abortion
8782790 when you deal with propane you always err on the side of caution which is exactly what we did

8782793 shows who is getting infected now and where we need to direct resources for prevention testing linkage to care and partner notification
8782794 the high incidence numbers are a direct result of programs and policies in new york city that inadequately meet the sexual health needs of gay and bisexual men of color
8782795 new york city and state officials continue to drastically cut already under funded hiv prevention education and supportive services around the city and the communities being hit the hardest are the very ones that are already severely underserved and most vulnerable hiv
8782796 i havent seen much outreach in the neighborhoods where its most needed
8782797 its not enough for the aids community to be outraged the city and the state needs to be as well they are the ones who have access to the billboards theyre the ones with the resources to reach people particularly african americans and gay men who are most affected
8782798 new york legislators including mayor bloomberg council speaker quinn and governor paterson are talking out of both sides of their mouths on the one hand they say they want to test more people with hiv while on the other hand they are cutting testing and other resources that will keep people alive they need to get real about what it will take to end the aids epidemic in new york particularly among poor people people of color and men who have sex with men until then new york legislators are going to continue to be embarrassed by reports like the one the department of health released today
8782799 the big story is the same as for other particular issues rollback the cutbacks
8782800 expand the shrinking pie to meet the real human needs
8782801 in some ways hiv aids surveillance is really the cadillac of surveillance systems but it has to be because of the way we use it
8782802 as long as ryan white funding depends on surveillance numbers were really letting it slide
8782803 managed care as a theory can work if recipients understand how to use it but there are so many different ways people can fall through the cracks
8782804 training education and outreach is essential to make consumer and providers aware of all the changes and the state department of health has a long way to go with outreach to the community before they can mandate another disabled population

8782811 every election always has a problem in every country whether its widespread i dont think so
8782812 each election has a winner and loser a mere fact that someone is not happy about losing has nothing to do with democracy just because he lost he cant say the system is wrong
8782813 el escritor antrop logo y fil sofo frances georges bataille 1897 1962 en uno de sus estudios sobre el erotismo habla de la idea de la anticipaci n de la muerte que se experimenta en los momentos m s intensos de una experiencia sexual los que explican por ejemplo la asociaci n de placer y dolor en el goce er tico haciendo referencia a esa expresi n francesa para referirse al orgasmo la peque a muerte ese momento de p rdida plena de control y de consciencia en el que el nos despersonalizamos no tanto en la fusi n con el otro que quiz es demasiado idealista sino m s bien en las oleadas de goce que propician la fusi n con lo otro como una anticipaci n de la muerte un enorme v rtigo el ser humano es capaz de erotizarse con cualquier cosa precisamente porque cualquier cosa es nada o sea falta de realidad y eso es en buena medida la experiencia de la peque a muerte un momento fugaz de p rdida de consciencia en la que lo dem s no existe hace poco un estudio revel que la parte del cerebro de una mujer que procesa el miedo la ansiedad y el dolor se desconecta durante el orgasmo produci ndose un estado semejante al del trance

8782819 casey is a womanizer and a player who cant keep it in his pants
8782820 casey hit on me every time he saw me he threw himself on me and foolishly we ended up making love almost every time during our romance casey was sleeping with as many as four other girls besides jamie lynn all casey can think about is the next person hes going to have sex with
8782821 first he persuaded me to stick around and hang out with him and his friend the he lured me out to his car and asked me if i wanted to go for a drive once we were in the truck casey was unrelenting it was stupid but we ended up having sex
8782822 during the holidays and birthdays casey always made sure he was with jamie lynn so he would get big expensive gifts from her and the spears family
8782823 so um the webpage or whatever is just something you do for fun do you have a real job
8782824 well that is our job we dont technically get money for
8782825 i say have you been crying and you say shut up so we sit in the garden and touch grass with our hands
8782826 are not satisfied that this courts intervention by way of extraordinary writ is warranted at this time
8782827 on the basis of the physical damage to the aircrafts forward cargo hold and cabin it is evident that the number 4 passenger oxygen cylinder sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurized contents
8782828 we need to boil that down we need to figure what changes have to be made to accommodate the concerns that are raised
8782829 theres been positive feedback but theres also been some adjustments that need to be made and we really need to sit down and talk about that and put our best foot forward
8782830 what are the adjustments that have to happen not to assume we got it all 100 per cent completely right
8782831 in my mind its a statement of principles its not a recipe
8782832 i think if we talk to people and tell them this is a statement of principles of intent and during the implementation that theres leeway to discuss with canadians i think thats the logical way to do it
8782833 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8782834 its important for us to see what is out there
8782835 we want to make sure that our standards and practices are the leading edge practices and that we leave no stone unturned to make sure that the propane facilities are very safe to operate in ontario and that the public is safe
8782836 for the public to have confidence in the public safety system the mcguinty government should have been out front on this
8782837 but its a government that doesnt like to take the blame so theyre shirking their responsibilities and im very disappointed in them
8782838 and i think we need to act on it sooner rather than later
8782839 it is intended to be divided equally as the minister noted
8782840 we recognize that from one day to the next the absolute amount of time on a particular task may not be exactly equal
8782841 about 50 per cent of an inspectors time is spent on the floor of the plant the other 50 per cent is overseeing paperwork most of it scientific in nature
8782842 so yeah they spend a lot of time there but not on the plant floor he doesnt even spend all his time at that maple leaf plant dealing with that plant
8782843 every one of them is afraid of being fired if they do
8782844 if thats the case how come so many people have died and we dont know how many more will be showing symptoms
8782845 the ball fell through and consumer confidence is right down the tubes with respect to government and companies like maple leaf its absolutely outrageous
8782846 i think that it should be investigated at the nursing home but i think the plant in which all this has developed it certainly should be checked into very very thoroughly
8782847 its affecting more and more people than you can possibly imagine
8782848 school lunches are going to have to be re thought hospitals cafeteria this is a major major consumer issue
8782849 they have to find out what caused this so that it can never happen again
8782850 if they dont find out how do i know that next month its not going to happen again or with some other products more care has to be put into how our food is prepared
8782851 it is intended to be divided equally as the minister noted
8782852 we recognize that from one day to the next the absolute amount of time on a particular task may not be exactly equal
8782853 the important message for people is that if you have the symptoms that are associated with listeriosis that you take precautionary actions as you see fit in terms of seeing a health professional or public health person
8782854 because we knew we had made those products we had removed them from sale when the recall was initiated
8782855 we executed the recall we did it effectively efficiently and the products that are now being recalled were prepared and sold prior to the recall
8782856 if theres a problem with a product we pull the product off the floor and begin calling our customers and typically within 24 hours everyones been called

8782931 theres nothing really new to report on senator mccains decision
8782932 mr mccain had narrowed his list to a handful of possibilities former rival mitt romney minnesota gov tim pawlenty former pennsylvania gov tom ridge and alaska gov sarah palin as well as wildcard sen joe lieberman the democrats 2000 vice presidential nominee who is now an independent

8782940 stands behind israel with full time diplomacy to achieve peace in the middle east
8782941 if they can find something in someones past that doesnt comport with their version of what is pro israel then youre anti israel
8782942 its very consistent with jewish values to take a position with an opponent when you agree the opponent is right
8782943 really has been a maverick on issues we care about
8782944 barack obamas blood is being spilled politically and we should not stand idly by

8782949 the republicans in a few days will nominate a good man who has served our country heroically and who suffered terribly in a vietnamese prison camp
8782950 he loves his country every bit as much as we do as a senator he has shown his independence of right wing orthodoxy on some very important issues
8782951 obviously i favor senator obamas energy positions and democrats have been by and large the more forward leaning actors
8782952 but john mccain has the best record of any republican running for president on the energy issue and on climate change im very encouraged about where the presidential rhetoric is in this campaign
8782953 id put my money on the sun and solar energy what a source of power i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that
8782954 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back

8782960 he did a very good job it was one of the best speeches ive seen sen kerry give
8782961 as a father to three children i definitely connected with his emotions
8782962 it was a very emotional time because i think a lot of us were learning for the first time his whole story
8782963 there is a big anti war protest going on im watching it on a monitor right now
8782964 it was true in boston as well there was talk of large protests but it didnt materialize
8782965 we had printed out condoms that say protect yourself from john mccain
8782966 there were 10 different reasons you can collect all 10
8782967 for instance reason number 10 is he wants to appoint supreme court justices who want to do away with roe v wade

8783024 the safest transportation system in the history of the world
8783025 besides sanctions he also said we will attack ukraine moldova and the crimea this is diseased imagination
8783026 france does not have a diseased imagination france was part of events in georgia and in russia where it fulfilled its work as european union president we do not want to halt the dialogue with russia absolutely not and france does not propose introducing sanctions
8783027 the legal basis for the war itself was and still is controversial there is a military need at least at the outset of operations to reinforce the legal base for deployment by clear unequivocal and timely direction and explanation
8783028 leaders should not start an operation without thinking it is not enough just to identify the desired end state
8783029 in whitehall the internal opsec operational security regime in which only very small numbers of officers and officials were allowed to become involved in telic business constrained broader planning for combat operations and subsequent phases effectively until 23 december 2002
8783030 the uk had to work to a timetable and strong ideological views set in the united states
8783031 the requirements to plan find resources for and undertake interim government and reconstruction in iraq the non military tasks were discussed in outline across whitehall but approaches to potential contractors were not made until combat operations were coming to an end planning was not done in sufficient depth and at the outset of phase iv post combat operations little finance was requested and approved for reconstruction purposes
8783032 t he uk government which spent millions of pounds on resourcing the security line of operations spent virtually none on the economic one on which security depended
8783033 obligations under the geneva conventions are laid on states and their agencies and not just on their armed services
8783034 coalition partners take different stances on other issues too including notably the law this embraces international and human rights law proportionality and collateral damage concepts
8783035 r elevant to the uk role in debriefing some of the high value detainees strong consideration should be given to the assignment of a legal adviser to any uk commander or group in a coalition operation when sensitive issues including debriefing and detention are likely to arise a formal review and promulgation of uk interrogation debriefing and detention guidance to uk staff embedded with coalition units is essential
8783036 british commanders and forces faced several constraints as subordinate partners in iraq there were significant differences in approach particularly relating to counter insurgency british counter insurgency experience is respected by some coalition commanders but others had not studied previous campaigns or did not want to hear about northern ireland or colonial struggles eg in malaya or kenya the unrest and violence following the fall of the saddam regime were recognised by british officers in mid 2003 as indicators of insurgent activity but it took longer for us commanders to accept this and to take suitable counter measures
8783037 i ntelligence cells were built on a similar basis to those used in northern ireland some battlegroups were fortunate enough to be able to use trained people experienced in northern ireland in the same role during their tours in iraq information operations psyops and media operations were effective
8783038 s omeone said it is just like northern ireland when i came back i asked which part of northern ireland were you in
8783039 the accepted level of violence had altered one commander said
8783040 there have been 191 investigations since the start of operations in iraq 171 of these investigations have been closed with no further action there are 5 cases which could be classed as deliberate abuse
8783041 regarding u s policy on settlements its clear its the right policy to try to help bring about a political settlement between israel and the palestinians
8783042 dozens of new families can now come live in hebron only if we renovate this building quickly
8783043 the u s government has no right to use political considerations when judging humanitarian and non profit needs

8783047 as you may know weve been hiring a great deal since sept 11 2001
8783048 we shall soon be setting up a government the mdc does not want to come in apparently this time they have been promised by the british that sanctions would be more devastating that in six months time the government will collapse
8783049 i do not know when that day will come i wish tsvangirai well on that day
8783050 i need managers i want workers people who take people to work i do not want people with own businesses i want one business the peoples business

8783063 u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict
8783064 they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8783065 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8783066 for the russians to say they are not responsible for what happened in georgia is ludicrous russia is to blame for this crisis and the world is responding to what russia has done

8783109 the rate of bgp path updates goes up by a factor of 200 to 400
8783110 they simply dont because it takes work and to do sufficient filtering to prevent these kinds of attacks on a global scale is cost prohibitive
8783111 that means that nobody could put themselves into the chain into the path unless they had been authorized to do so by the preceding as router in the path
8783112 we havent seen the attacks and so a lot of times people dont start working on things and trying to fix them until they get attacked
8783113 but the youtube case is the perfect example of an attack where somebody could have done much worse than what they did
8783114 the only thing that can force them to fix bgp is if their customers start to demand security solutions

8783144 our organization is concerned that dunkin donuts will become as well known for its lawsuits as for its coffee and food products
8783145 targeting franchisees because of their lifestyle is particularly troublesome no franchisee should be under suspicion or treated differently for aspiring to the american dream
8783146 we would like to see more reason and balance brought to this situation to our knowledge the dunkin system is the most litigious major qsr system out there

8783149 if you look at log files or system events to understand what is going on in your machines or in your network a lot of people look at their textual logs and the problem is you have 100 000 lines or more so its really hard to figure out whats happening in that data
8783150 if you generate a picture from that data you very quickly can see what is going on in there
8783151 if there were more tools out there to make this easier i think a lot more people would actually use visualisation
8783152 with firewall log files you dont need to know what specific ip address is connecting to me from the outside

8783164 xavi quiere practicar un juego agresivo correr mucho y no especular nunca con el resultado siempre quiere el cien por cien y me beneficia porque me gusta jugar agresivo
8783165 es verdad que se han fichado grandes jugadores de gran nombre y es bueno que se creen expectativas que la afici n tenga ganas de que consigamos cosas buenas eso crear una presi n positiva a los jugadores creo que nunca se debe mirar en que sea negativa que si se pierde un partido bajes la cabeza sino al rev s
8783166 al que le gusta mucho marcarse retos para cumplirlos y ser una persona feliz
8783167 su fichaje es muy importante ha demostrado que puede jugar en la nba y de sobras pero ahora vuelve aqu con muchas ganas de conseguir t tulos porque es un ganador siempre lo ha sido y ayudar al equipo a lograr grandes cosas

8783172 alejandro ir a su aire e intentar ganar alguna etapa si luego por su tremenda calidad entra en carrera y se viene arriba ser fant stico pero en un principio su pr ximo objetivo es el mundial
8783173 el partido ante kohlschreiber el a o pasado en la grandstand en el quinto set el ambiente era fant stico

8783180 estoy muy contento por l se lo merece si no lo hab a sido antes era porque delante estaba un federer que es el mejor tenista de la historia el mejor que he visto en mi vida su control del circuito era absoluto

8783184 gasp rachel tittle oh my gosh its been so long
8783185 its the economy and its jobs and it couldnt be any plainer than that i think the economy is in terrible condition and i think that our prospect for good employment opportunities are narrowing because of the loss of manufacturing i believe that barack obama and democrats are gonna help us get it changed around if our membership and the membership of all the other unions and working people in general will just vote bread and butter issues then well be ok
8783186 john mccain is leading the republican ticket and does believe very fundamentally in different values than we as democrats do he believes that the country is going in the right direction he believes that the bush policies were good policies we believe the country is going in the wrong direction and we have to bring it back for regular people to be able to do extraordinary things they dont want to spend money on education theyd rather spend money on tax cuts theyd rather say that the economy is not failing as it is for middle class workers they would rather just keep it as it is let the schism between rich and poor in this country grow and the american dream which was built on having a strong viable middle class is less and less within our grasp
8783187 hopefully getting past these barriers mentally and numbers wise we can put that in the past and become the organization were envisioned on becoming
8783188 i think you have to give those guys some credit over there
8783189 theyve got a pretty good pitching staff that will shut you down
8783190 i made a couple of mistake pitches and they hit them over the fence
8783191 im really proud of the fact that weve really raised the level of our intensity despite only having 12 000 people in the stands
8783192 theyve been very professional about this thats the part i really appreciate about it also youd like to see 36 000 every night but for right now the way our guys are going about our business im very proud of them
8783193 we will assess what they say or whether theyll maintain an eloquent silence
8783194 we have no complaint about the position taken by our colleagues
8783195 debajo de la cama est el guab cuidao que te pica y se te va
8783196 he has thought this through and he continues to move forward in an area that involves obviously the pak military his authorities over the frontier corps as well and so expectations for instantaneous results i think are probably a little bit too high
8783197 more than anything else i think it was that we clearly went through what the challenges are the specifics of it what we think the threat is how to get at it
8783198 security trends continue to head in the right direction violence is down more than its been at any time in four plus years the political process continues
8783199 i would hope to be able to make recommendations for further troop reductions when those conditions are met
8783200 as far as the specifics of when we would get that done or how we would get that done we just havent arrived at that particular point
8783201 weve got that request and were looking for ways to answer that
8783202 thats where the need is right now specifically on the military side and so were working hard to provide as much of that as we can
8783203 part of what i did in my engagement when this crisis started was in speaking with my counterpart and i was very straightforward about the fact that we were going to bring the georgian troops back from iraq
8783204 i did that to make sure he knew what we were doing and that that same kind of communication is going on
8783205 we have not received any formal notification from the u s side
8783206 it is not just that the american side could not restrain the georgian leadership from this criminal act the american side in effect armed and trained the georgian army
8783207 why seek a difficult compromise solution in the peacekeeping process it is easier to arm one of the sides and provoke it into killing another side and the job is done
8783208 if that is true if that is confirmed then thats really bad its very dangerous and a mistaken policy
8783209 it that was the case then the recent events could have a american domestic political dimension
8783210 if my suspicions are confirmed in that case the suspicion arises that somebody in the united states has intentionally created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of u s president
8783211 if that was the case its nothing less than the use of so called administrative resources in a domestic political fight in its worst bloody dimension
8783212 i would not want to speculate on the outcome of the european council of course i can only express the wish that the leaders european leaders heads of state and government of the european union will be able to rise above the emotions of the day and consider seriously and without prejudice the perspectives of strategic partnership with their important partner the russian federation
8783213 first of all i highly doubt that might ever happen but theoretically speaking hypothetically speaking this would be to the detriment of the european union as much if not more than to russia
8783214 any charges that the u s instigated this conflict are ludicrous
8783215 what we need to focus on is what russias done russia still occupies parts of georgia and its in violation of its obligations under the cease fire agreement and we want to see russia comply with its obligations and charges that the united states had anything to do with instigating this conflict i mean as i said theyre just ludicrous
8783216 we have to put mechanisms in place that will not only allow a sustained ceasefire but will also help avoid reoccurrence of violent incidents
8783217 here in darfur there are similarities of course because here you have people who seem to be marginalized who want to be more developed but the difficulty here is the interference and outside interference in the darfur conflict so it is a little bit complicated but we will try
8783218 of course there is need for security on the ground and also i think that we should avoid and be careful that people do not use the camps for fighting arms and ammunition this specific question should be a point for our negotiation and when i was in khartoum yesterday i talked about this situation and this consequence for the mediation security will be the first point of our talks
8783219 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition we dont know and so i dont think anybody can tell you when life begins human life begins
8783220 and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy but it is also true that god has given us a free will and a responsibility to answer for our actions
8783221 ardent practicing catholics will quickly learn from the historical record that from apostolic times the christian tradition overwhelmingly held that abortion was grievously evil
8783222 some of the early fathers held that abortion was homicide others that it was tantamount to homicide and various scholars theorized about when and how the unborn child might be animated or ensouled but none diminished the unique evil of abortion as an attack on life itself
8783223 it is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it catholics who make excuses for it whether theyre famous or not fool only themselves and abuse the fidelity of those catholics who do sincerely seek to follow the gospel and live their catholic faith
8783224 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable
8783225 i have personal experience at that when i made my remarks about the rutgers basketball team which was mean spirited and directed at people who did not deserve to be made fun of and was not funny i apologized for that i didnt offer any lame excuses but he refused to place into context either my life or any of the work that i had done in my life
8783226 as i pointed out to al sharpton i slept in the house here at the ranch with more black children who are not related to me than either one of them the obamas ever have and then when this psychopath rev wright shoots his mouth off and i wasnt serious but he was serious making outrageous reprehensible remarks
8783227 the first thing senator obama asked all of us to do was to place this clowns life in perspective and to consider the context thats nonsense i dont detest senator obama at all i just think hes disingenuous and a phony
8783228 why do the democrats invite every loser dukakis and gore and john kerry and clinton hanging around to remind everybody that here is another guy who couldnt get it done i dont get that it just reminds us that its been one disastrous campaign after another
8783229 everyone is entitled to their own opinion no one is entitled to their own facts
8783230 im not running for president to be somebody but to do something im running to do the hard but necessary things not the easy and needless things im running for president to protect our country from harm and defeat its enemies im running for president to make the government do its job not your job im not running to leave our biggest problems to an unluckier generation of leaders but to fix them now and fix them well
8783231 our report will certainly be accepting the good parts of the old plan if you want to put it that way and making recommendations of how to proceed forward from there in particular in relation to the 43 to 45 hospitals that were in the smaller category

8783239 gary is absolutely devastated by the decision he and his family are distraught they are completely beside themselves he is terrified by the prospect of going to america
8783240 in particular the strength friendship and assistance provided by my estranged husband dale continues to be invaluable despite the tremendous pressures that he is under
8783241 together with the excellent medical care i am receiving i have also appreciated the fantastic support from my amazing group of close friends and staff members
8783242 i had celebrated my 21st birthday during the hungarian revolt we were just a few minutes away from the russian military everything was in a high state of alert when we thought about it it was quite frightening
8783243 here we were a bunch of kids just fresh out of high school
8783244 it had been 11 years but you could still smell it
8783245 we are sorry for the bad taste exercised and the offense caused by use of this clip
8783246 we need a president that cares more for barney smith than smith barney
8783247 barack obama is much better than cats id see he again and again
8783248 theyre gonna try and scare you say hes got a funny name did i mention he was black
8783249 in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8783250 these are the policies i will pursue and in the weeks ahead
8783251 i think thats part of the reason why im not being successful
8783252 when i was in the minors i always started like 100 and everybody was really worried about me but ive always trusted in my tools and i know that i can do it
8783253 but you dont ever make promises in this business you just go down you do your best you get your swing back and you earn your way back up
8783254 something thats deep in the left field corner a cameraman from a certain angle might be more inclined to focus on the player well now he might be a little bit wider and keep an eye on the tip of the fence
8783255 because we know what were doing the camera guys know what theyre doing its up to major league baseball to take it from there
8783256 we shall pay any price bear any burden meet any hardship support any friend oppose any foe in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty
8783257 peoples republic of soviet socialist amerikan states and the fact that they are hypocritically evoking past party members who werent soft and squishy in the face of aggression proves that they know that they have to bamboozle the voters into believing theyre the same because to do otherwise would lead to defeat

8783259 nu dam bani la scoli dar dam bani la o parohie la care a lucrat un consilier psd domnul dinu apavaloaie aia este o lucrare facuta de dumnealui si mai are de luat 500 de milioane de lei vechi asta este explicatia
8783260 tot ce s a facut la parohia sodomeni prin firma fiilor mei pentru ca eu sint doar presedinte al consiliului de administratie n r la sc adems este cu titlu gratuit am acte care sa demonstreze asta
8783261 nu inteleg de ce va intereseaza ce consilieri au cerut rediscutarea acestui punct toti au cerut mai putin cei de la pdl motivatia a fost ca pina acum nu s a refuzat niciodata o solicitare de la o biserica
8783262 este o situatie foarte delicata si ne cerem scuze alegatorilor nostri pentru faptul ca am parasit sedinta cred ca va deveni o obisnuinta din partea grupului de consilieri judeteni ai pdl daca domnul presedinte va continua cu acest comportament ne considera niste elevi iar dumnealui este diriginte
8783263 it cannot be the future of the museum to concentrate only on tibetan and himalayan art or only on our own collection
8783264 i have a chief operating officer who has 25 years of experience a great fiscal director and a great staff
8783265 we hope that the public will want this museum to continue a long time
8783266 you have a different culture for just about every chief executive and chairman that exists
8783267 jack welchs style is different from mine and from the 100 other top ceos in the country
8783268 when my time here is up there will be somebody with a different personality a different organizational structure and a different corporate culture
8783269 they would say oh youre from tibet how wonderful we thought you were from the philippines or thailand
8783270 i mean they didnt say it so clearly but it was obvious that when they heard that she was from tibet they were completely different

8783273 barack obama este pregatit sa fie presedinte al statelor unite
8783274 tot ce am invatat in opt ani de presedintie si tot ce am realizat de atunci in statele unite si in lume m au convins ca obama este omul potrivit
8783275 hillary ne a spus fara echivoc ca va face tot ce poate pentru ca obama sa fie ales impreuna cu mine sintem doi
8783276 de fapt sintem 18 milioane pentru ca doresc ca si hillary ca toti cei care ati sustinut o sa votati in noiembie pentru obama
8783277 cer ca senatorul obama sa fie ales de aceasta conventie prin aclamare
8783278 cu mare onoare anunt ca barack obama este candidatul partidului democrat la presedintia statelor unite prin aclamare
8783279 if you have to be afraid to smile at somebody

8783283 you know chuck i can remember when we used to win these things
8783284 it was a reflection i think of his own concerns about society and the world we live in
8783285 tommy came to me with 20 pages of the script of will penny and i thought they were just great
8783286 i showed them to chuck who ordinarily did not green light any project until he saw the completed script and he said i love the character i love the idea and i can identify lets go ahead and do it
8783287 under our lessons learned weve changed our plans and have now located more soldiers in coastal areas so they are already in place should they be needed
8783288 were planning and supporting for the worst but hoping for the best
8783289 we hope thats not necessary but we are preparing just in case
8783290 i think even for a senator it takes some pretty serious yodeling to call for a filibuster from a five star ski resort in the swiss alps
8783291 which david boyle and myself will be proposing at party conference next month
8783292 well see what happens but were in good shape the gap in the championship is big but well keep fighting until its over
8783293 we had a great result at misano last year and that added to the fact that were in good shape with the set up and the tyres means we can be reasonably confident of another good result here
8783294 im really excited to be going to misano in such good shape and leading the championship
8783295 last year the race was a huge disappointment for us a very low point of the season and especially sad because it happened in front of my home fans
8783296 but this time things are very different weve had two fantastic races in a row and we are feeling very strong and very confident we are out to make up for 2007
8783297 misano is so close to my home town of tavullia that i know there will be an army of italian fans there and i hope its going to be a great party for all of them
8783298 last year there was some terrible weather before the race as well so i really hope that this year we have sunshine and we can enjoy a fantastic race by the sea
8783299 father son and holy spirit help me to think creatively and love genuinely in the name of him who is reaching out to us all with the gift of pardon amen
8783300 but i tell you who hear me love your enemies do good to those who hate you bless those who curse you pray for those who mistreat you if someone strikes you on one cheek turn to him the other also if someone takes your cloak do not stop him from taking your tunic give to everyone who asks you and if anyone takes what belongs to you do not demand it back do to others as you would have them do to you
8783301 my office has been inundated with calls from right across gippsland including from omeo benambra and the tambo valley and theyre telling me conditions are as bad as theyve ever seen
8783302 its still terribly dry the recovery is not underway in large parts of gippsland its great that rain has fallen but large parts of gippsland are still struggling and i think nrac has made a mistake
8783303 the more people that are involved in this the better for us it doesnt matter if youre in any receipt of ec benefit or not the fact of the matter is that it does affect our local economy it does affect us seriously and is very important

8783341 the outward military aggression with the use of ballistic missiles from russia on a former ussr country sends a very serious message to all former members of the soviet bloc
8783342 are we willing to end four decades of arms control agreements and go it alone a kind of bully nation sometimes a little wrongheaded but ready to make unilateral decisions in what we perceive to be our self interest

8783404 peter garrett must draw the line under the project and say its over
8783405 we need to hear from minister garrett and the tasmanian government that there will be no extensions no rolling over

8783407 the question is has he got the backbone to exercise the power
8783408 hes rolled over on beverley will he roll over on the pulp mill
8783409 will he give gunns that extension or will he agree that october the 4th is the cut off

8783432 what berlin teaches architects and urban planners is above all humility the building and planning frenzy of the 1990s showed that architecture cannot be expected to counteract the provisional and temporary nature of this city nor relieve its social frailty what it can do however is to continue to create stages and project images good metropolitan architecture has much in common with good stage design a fact more apparent in berlin than anywhere else in the world

8783441 to have the chief justice of our nation judge our final four moot court competition is a great privilege for our students and the university of florida

8783457 the defendants to prolong their nearly ten year failure to abide by their constitutional duty to uphold the doctrine of separation of powers
8783458 wait ing patiently for nearly ten years for defendants to take action in accordance with their constitutional duty

8783541 failure to identify the specific documents on which they rely is fatal to their ability to meet the pleading requirements
8783542 reliance upon alleged documents which are undated unquoted undescribed and unattached amounts to nonspecific allegations at best
8783543 plaintiffs are represented by sophisticated counsel who represented to the court that they are firms which have substantial experience in the prosecution of shareholder and securities class actions under these circumstances wherein defendants have already had to defend against two complaints in the matter allowing the plaintiffs a third bite at the pleading apple would result in prejudice to the defendants
8783544 were carefully evaluating the opinion and considering several options for moving forward
8783545 the momentum that we have built in 06 is going to accelerate
8783546 saw tens of thousands of subscribers defect to its competition
8783547 this exodus of customers was exacerbated by comcasts horrific customer service
8783548 right now its all clicking the business is on fire
8783549 the triple play is driving incredible operating momentum and we see that accelerating as it continues to roll out
8783550 plaintiffs appear to be relying exclusively on documentary evidence as the source of their allegations of fraud as they make no mention of any confidential or other personal sources
8783551 cite to any source to uphold their bare allegation that the expiration of the triple play promotional rate among some customers caused many subscribers to leave or forced comcast to continue to offer the promotional rate to other customers

8783558 saquemos esa bandera blanca manejemos la situaci n con concordia y demos el ejemplo
8783559 muchas veces el silencio conduce a la impunidad pol tica y por eso el gobierno responde
8783560 es importante sacar la bandera blanca pero es m s importante conservar los principios para que mediante un di logo se pueda llegar a lo mejor para el pa s
8783561 las reacciones de la corte de la oposici n y del presidente uribe pueden generar una polarizaci n que no le cae bien al pa s
8783562 es bueno que el presidente invite a todo el mundo a un di logo a un consenso para que se puedan seguir buscando unas relaciones arm nicas entre las diferentes ramas del poder p blico
8783563 el llamado est muy bien pero antes de bajarle el tono a la discusi n lo que hay es que llamarle seriamente la atenci n al presidente sobre el incumplimiento de una obligaci n constitucional suya que consiste en que l debe respetar y hacer respetar los fallos de las cortes

8783566 we deeply regret the fact that we have been forced to cease all zoom operations
8783567 it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff
8783568 even as late as lunchtime today thursday we believed we had secured a new investment package to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying
8783569 having been unable to complete the investment package the directors of zoom had no option but to instigate insolvency administration proceedings
8783570 these are things that were going to work through and if we find passengers in difficult circumstances everybodys going to have to work together to deal with that
8783571 our discussions with zoom today led us to take this action
8783572 we will just continue our discussion with zoom over the next while to attempt to get this outstanding debt resolved
8783573 zoom was trying to get into a market that didnt exist really

8783576 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8783577 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight on nov
8783578 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8783579 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000
8783580 john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies all over again
8783581 senator obama this is truly a good day for america

8783588 therere some actors in this country like amitabh bachchan chiranjeevi kamal haasan and rajnikant who are above success and failure theyre blessed people if you say im one of them then i too am blessed
8783589 jackie chan appears in a major action sequence with me im trying to physically prepare for the role ive already shot for about 150 days for nair san in japan and mongolia
8783590 im the first actor from malayalam cinema to feature in a japanese film ive to speak not only in japanese but also in chinese and mongolian
8783591 nair was an indian freedom fighter ive met the man he owns a chain of restaurants ive been to his restaurant in tokyo and he has been to my home in kerala
8783592 he passed away at the age of 85 86 i feel very privileged to be playing nair the film will definitely get wide release in japan
8783593 i can tell you that ibsen at this point of time couldnt be done in any other language but malayalam im fortunate to have done it as an actor its my job to do the best of the roles i get however the roles have to come to me i cant go after the roles
8783594 it was the director k p kumarans dream for 20 years he had been pursuing me for 15 years to do a screen adaptation of ibsens play i finally agreed
8783595 ibsens the master builder is a complicated play ive done stage plays including a play in sanskrit but ibsen is tough however i treated the film like any other i play an architect changes were made for example my characters norwegian name was changed for the indian audience
8783596 people just pounced on ramu they forgot how much he has achieved in the past such things happen in fact priyadarshan has just offered me a role in a hindi film to be done in the middle of next year i get a lot of hindi films but they dont interest me
8783597 but ill do priyans film its a 12 13 day film it isnt a conventional hindi film it has a message on aids priyan is returning to his roots he recently did a fantastic malayalam film called kanjeevaram i was supposed to do it but i couldnt now im looking forward to working with him and to doing a hindi film

8783610 the collection was begun out of public demand during the war years when film was used at the community level to advance the war effort
8783611 when i was a kid growing up my father used to borrow 16 mm prints from our local public library to watch at home
8783612 part of what makes the collection vibrant is peoples use of it
8783613 folks ive spoken to at neighborhood branches say that with the closing of movie theaters in their areas the demand for a common space for people to come and watch movies together has really gone up
8783614 thats really important not just because of the decline of repertory theaters but the closing of movie theaters in general
8783615 biden on paper has more to work with in putting together a broadly based candidacy than any of the other democrats
8783616 he is a very helpful person and i experienced it as a republican

8783618 we were told yesterday that ambassador khalilzad will come back home earlier than expected from his vacation i am sure he will be confronted with more erroneous assumptions from reporters who dont bother checking the facts
8783619 ambassador khalilzad is in constant touch with the state department
8783620 he knows and delivers the policies of the united states
8783621 i desire you would use all your skill to paint your picture truly like me and not flatter me at all but remark all these roughness pimples warts and everything as you see me otherwise i will never pay a farthing for it
8783622 some people do come with ideas in their heads could i lose them a bit of weight in the painting for example i tell them to come back when theyve been on a diet about one in four people who talk to me about a portrait are looking to be improved on im doing well enough now to refuse them
8783623 destroying a work like that of lucian freud is a sacrilegious act
8783624 there has been a tremendous revival in the last 20 years there is more commissioning going on than at any other time people are fascinated by the process producing something that is about much much more than just a likeness it is a most demanding area of painting the landscape never argues back a still life doesnt talk to you
8783625 even if a great painting is in private ownership it is part of our common culture his reaction was very extreme there is a huge gulf between not liking a work and deciding to destroy it in the end it is a subjective view and none of us really know what we look like we see ourselves in the mirror the other way round only other people know what we look like
8783626 joshua reynolds is regarded as tidying people up but there were other paintings that were very literal some portraits particularly royal ones were meant to convey a sense of power rather than hard reality
8783627 only lucian freud and a few others such as hockney can paint a picture uncommissioned and then sell it by virtue of their name im not in a position to paint a portrait of someone and sell it in its own right as a chuck goodwin freud could go out into the street choose a street sweeper paint him and sell it for a million pounds
8783628 if somebody wants me to paint their wife they dont want me to make her look like shes had a late night you compromise you make the woman look younger but even then she might say i dont look like that do i
8783629 we dont see ourselves as we are think how surprised you can be to catch your reflection in a shop window lucian freud is quite cruel they said his portrait of the queen was quite cruel but hes incredibly good at bringing out aspects of character
8783630 there is always beauty yes even the ugliest face can be beautiful its in the eye of the beholder

8783633 the first public screening of any film i did was at the museum of modern art in 1995
8783634 american job played as part of the cineprobe series so it felt like a nice bookending in that way
8783635 since ive started making films a lot of people have come to me and said theyd be interested in working with me or funding it but i started in a very independent space and ive sort of stayed there ive always been interested in working on whatever seems most interesting at the time
8783636 we had this idea of doing an internet tv station which doesnt sound that radical now
8783637 the idea was to try to come together and do original content for the internet at the time people were able to submit work to the site
8783638 people were taking videotapes and sending them to us and we would compress them and put them on the site
8783639 and most of the people were still using dial up
8783640 it was like a 10 piece band that did sort of jazz sort of funk music
8783641 the pool was the hardest thing i ever worked on in my life
8783642 the casting of the film was an odyssey in the three days leading up to the film we lost three of the main actors for different reasons one kid went up to bombay to buy karate uniforms and said he would be back in 24 hours and we never heard from him again
8783643 no one knew we were going over and no one really cared in that sense

8783646 i dont photograph acts of graffiti per se i am drawn to the decay and chaos and how that becomes part of the art
8783647 for me the challenge is how to draw out beauty from chaos and decay
8783648 it happens very quickly i will walk by a wall of street art one day and the next morning it has already been altered
8783649 in the early 1980s my father began to photograph the spray paint murals that sprang up all over city just because he enjoyed them
8783650 theres an energy there that just leaps out from the wall
8783651 during the last decade there has been a tremendous surge in the breadth and beauty of street art
8783652 i am capturing forms you may not notice when walking by a wall covered with graffiti
8783653 even the outlying areas of new york have been affected places that i usually travel to look at street art like williamsburg and coney island

8783661 like advise and consent this is about the personal meeting the political with melodrama burn after reading is also our version of a tony scott jason bourne kind of movie without the explosions
8783662 i think there is something random at the heart of this one
8783663 on the one hand it really is bleak and scary on the other it is really funny
8783664 its the whatever ness of it you feel that at any minute of any day in any town this could happen
8783665 but most of the things we pursue in america whether in new york l a or washington are deluded he is not alone in that i hope the film is touching on some level what is amazing is that he isnt the dumbest of the characters they all are a bit thick
8783666 when you watch a coen brothers movie it is always so certain about what it is trying to portray
8783667 that is their strength the minute they write a word they know how it will look on screen they are very purposeful with no kind of mistakes

8783673 but he does not quite fully understand the values of the heartland he is too much of an easterner at heart even if he is pro life

8783754 john mccain ha votado con george bush el 90 de las veces al senador mccain le gusta hablar de tener criterio pero realmente qu criterio tienes si piensas que george bush ha estado en lo cierto en el 90 por ciento de las veces
8783755 no s ustedes pero yo no estoy dispuesto a apostar que la posibilidad de cambio sea del 10 por ciento
8783756 no creo que al senador mccain no le importe la vida de los estadounidenses realmente lo que creo es que no sabe lo que les pasa c mo se puede explicar que defina la clase media como la familia que ingresa m s de cinco millones de d lares al a o
8783757 la creencia de que podemos lograr todo lo que nos propongamos es lo que ha caracterizado a este pa s pero ahora esta creencia est en peligro porque estamos en un momento en que estamos en guerra nuestra econom a est agitada y el sue o americano est de nuevo bajo amenaza
8783758 el gobierno no ha sido el causante de todos estos problemas pero el fracaso en afrontarlos s es culpa del gobierno fallido de george w bush y de la pol tica quebrantada que se hace en washington

8783770 as australias largest home loan provider it makes good strategic sense to look at alternative investments in this industry that will continue to bring benefits to shareholders and consumers mr norris said
8783771 the australian mortgage and housing industries are the backbone of the economy and the purchase of a home remains the largest single investment made by many consumers
8783772 as this market continues to develop a strategic investment in one of the market leading providers in this industry is a natural fit for the group he added

8783776 offensichtlich ist der hessische ministerpr sident koch mit uns der auffassung dass die beiden gro st dte durch den flughafenausbau in nicht hinnehmbarer weise durch flugl rm belastet w rden
8783777 offensichtlich hat die landesregierung erkannt dass die belastungen f r die st dte mainz und offenbach die sich aus dem drohenden flughafenausbau ergeben nicht zumutbar und nicht durchsetzbar sind
8783778 so kommt die von offenbacher seite immer wieder vorgetragene alternative einer entlastung bereits stark betroffener kommunen und einer gerechteren l rmverteilung erneut auf die tagesordnung
8783779 dass es der hessischen landesregierung besser angestanden h tte diese problematik schon in der planfeststellung zu l sen
8783780 the committee has made a conscious decision to try to move regional competition off campuses and olympic sized rinks while still preserving a great college atmosphere
8783781 i think it is an exciting thing for the league and for fans
8783782 we are kind of the guinea pigs its a choice we made and maybe other leagues will follow suit
8783783 i dont think we have ever felt the level of frustration that we felt after that match was over
8783784 last season when we had preseason scrimmages it really wasnt that competitive
8783785 last year we probably had four five players who were not really up to the caliber of big ten play
8783786 we only have 11 players on scholarship we could have 12 thats our max but every one can play
8783787 lauren is probably the most competitive player on our team
8783788 if we ask them to put on their shoes she wants to be first and thats literal
8783789 part of the team was pulling in one direction and the coaching staff in another direction
8783790 and some members of the team were pulling in no direction
8783791 we prepared for this season with long painful meetings that you dont really think are necessary at the time
8783792 weve put in a lot more effort off the court making sure we are all getting along
8783793 there is so much that goes out of my reach and i have to rely on a solid senior class to take care of that
8783794 we didnt have one last year there was a lot of random behavior and we never really marshalled in one direction
8783795 thats what went wrong and thats what we fixed i think
8783796 first of all hes healthy gophers coach tim brewster said appraising vandesteegs fall camp
8783797 hes explosive coming off the ball i see him come off the ball and rush the passer and he does a great job with his hands
8783798 playing defensive line at this level you cant play with one arm he said
8783799 it just doesnt work you need both hands you have to be able to hit with both hands to shed blocks and with just one hand and the other is basically a club it just doesnt work
8783800 it was kind of like the whole right side of my body fell apart he said
8783801 they say one part of your body goes the next part goes because you overcompensate by then it was kind of like oh my gosh what else can go wrong
8783802 a couple kids started running their mouth telling me i wasnt any good the gophers werent any good he said
8783803 i take pride in what i do and i love the gophers when someone is sitting there yapping in my ear and i tell them to go away go do your own thing well you know something happened
8783804 i wasnt very happy to see him but i did go she said
8783805 ive always supported him and loved him and tried to teach him to make good choices none of us is perfect the best thing i could do for him at that point was to tell him to stand up to what he did correct it and move on with his life
8783806 you know maybe drinking didnt suit me the best he said
8783807 i probably wont ever drink again i go out now and have a kiddie cocktail people laugh but i dont need to drink to have fun
8783808 you always hear people talking about getting in trouble because other people are harassing you he said
8783809 you dont believe it can happen to you until it happens it wasnt a very good deal when it happened to me but ive learned from it i feel like im a better man because of it
8783810 i feel like i just got here and now its almost over he said
8783811 she knew i was hurt and shes a mom so she takes care of me he said
8783812 but she always said if im able to go i should go youve only got four years in high school and then four more in college so dont have any regrets just because you have injuries
8783813 he was really down he wanted to play so bad and hed worked so hard
8783814 ill be honest with you i felt like i was comfortable and i knew everything last year but until you get out there and youre doing it you have no clue what youre doing
8783815 ill be so much more relaxed and be able to just have the game come to me
8783816 whereas last year in the first game i was forcing things a little bit too much i didnt know quite what i was doing and this year i feel like there will be a better calmness throughout the whole game
8783817 it allows you to expose the defenses and you can potentially put up so many points and so much yardage against a team but ultimately it falls on the quarterback to get the team in the right place thats whats so great about the offense because all of the responsibility is on the guy calling the plays thats whats so fun about it
8783818 we know that where we were last year will be hanging over us for a while but its our job this year to be a whole new team and to continue to focus on this year and know that last year is motivation for us to become a better team and become a more successful team i guess im just really focusing and always keep reminding myself that football is just a game
8783819 you think things are going good and thats football just one play its just going to make me work that much harder
8783820 its something a little setback but ill be ready to go by next season and i plan on being ready for otas organized team activities and minicamps
8783821 well its going to definitely be a full evaluation process to elect a new president but we have some viable candidates that can do a great job

8783832 all the signs indicate that this parliament is at the end of its productiveness
8783833 and hes breaking his word to voters not to have an election
8783834 i think we were right not to have an election before canadians can find out more about what this government is about
8783835 we can see with these cuts what this government is about

8783840 unjustifiably interfered with defendants relationship with counsel and their ability to mount a defense in violation of the sixth amendment
8783841 kpmg faced ruin by indictment and reasonably believed it must do everything in its power to avoid it
8783842 the governments threat of indictment was easily sufficient to convert its adversary into its agent kpmg was not in a position to consider coolly the risk of indictment weigh the potential significance of the other enumerated factors in the thompson memorandum and decided for itself how to proceed
8783843 and if the sixth amendment prohibits the government from interfering with such arrangements then surely it also prohibits the government from interfering with financial donations by others such as family members and neighbors and employers
8783844 as if it had never experienced the governments pressure in the first place
8783845 when the totality of the circumstances show that the advancement of legal fees was intended to impede a criminal investigation
8783846 c orporations will receive the same credit for disclosing facts that are contained in unprotected materials as they would for disclosing the identical facts contained in protected materials
8783847 the government will assess neither a credit nor a penalty based on whether the disclosed materials are protected by the attorney client privilege or attorney work product
8783848 permitting and respecting the need for such attorney client communications is particularly important because such dialogue is often a necessary a typically salutary part of a companys efforts to obey the law on an ongoing basis

8783857 a combination of anticipated outages at other production reactors coupled with unanticipated shutdowns is simply devastating the impact on the patients who are in need of diagnostic tests using these radioisotopes is very serious the united states and other countries are not prepared to adequately deal with the current situation let alone anticipate other situations as they continue to arise following the shutdown of canadas chalk river facility late last year we simply cannot afford to sit and wait as the situation continues to worsen
8783858 this could be described as a perfect storm in isotope availability
8783859 this is a cumulative situation where we cannot maintain a patchwork approach to isotope production and supply it also highlights the vulnerability of having no domestic source of clinically used isotopes in the united states
8783860 i think were of the same mind on that one the most we can hope for is a few bones as you say health care a tax cut on the middle class maybe some reform and protection of public education etc
8783861 im not disputing the facts just pointing out theres similar inconvenient facts regarding mccain and romney

8783872 great insights about life and death i was in yoga class when i first heard about the shark attack none of us believed it at first of course later many of us got scared and didnt want to go in the water i think that lasted a week

8783874 alverson this election has nothing to do with what happened 40 years ago frankly im sick of regurgitating the 60s every four years give john mccain a medal a gold watch and a handshake we need a president focused on 2010s not the 60s
8783875 it was until 1968 i think every reporter secretly craves for the world to blow up during one of these things
8783876 live blogging when read after the fact is still exciting i think its time for the democrats to lose the obligatory reference to john mccains heroism when attacking his politics back handed compliments are tactless

8783909 i very much enjoy your posts about your patients and i guess i assume that your detachment as you describe them does not indicate a lack of personal consideration for the same
8783910 i would like to clarify since my post comes off as a little harsh that i did enjoy reading the post and the piece it referred to

8783936 around the world there is a real recognition now that deforestation is one of the major drivers of climate change and a recognition that primary forests are huge carbon stores and they know that their investors their shareholders are going to be very unhappy she said
8783937 the environment message has been out there for years and finally the australian and tasmanian governments are getting the message that shareholders are going to drive companies to actually get out of native forests
8783938 peter garrett must draw the line under the project and say its over
8783939 we need to hear from minister garrett and the tasmanian government that there will be no extensions no rolling over
8783940 clearly peter garrett has lost the passion senator milne said
8783941 the question is has he got the backbone to exercise the power
8783942 hes rolled over on beverley will he roll over on the pulp mill
8783943 will he give gunns that extension or will he agree that october the 4th is the cut off
8783944 i am being politically persecuted by those defeated yesterday in a just and necessary war

8783957 were here for the millions of americans who have been knocked down to send a message together to send a message that were going to get back up as a nation
8783958 the experience lincolns supporters valued most in that race was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
8783959 in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch see photos from around denver on the fourth and final day of the democratic national convention another new beginning and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition

8783963 but i dont know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers
8783964 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8783965 what he should not do is what he will be criticized for not doing give a detailed policy speech this is not the place for that
8783966 we dont know who to give a lot of this stuff to
8783967 a lot of this stuff was never investigated because people dont report it
8783968 i have a loving and supportive wife whose love and support has limits
8783969 we travel quite a few miles from place to place so were putting a lot of time on the road
8783970 part of what has been lost these past eight years cant just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits
8783971 what has also been lost is our sense of common purpose our sense of higher purpose and thats what we have to restore
8783972 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off and look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8783973 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and by the way john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8783974 discriminating against those who are sick and need care most
8783975 i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8783976 and i will restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
8783977 surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country
8783978 this too is part of the american promise the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort
8783979 we prove that a dream still burns in the hearts of every american that this dream was too right too necessary too noble to ever die
8783980 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day
8783981 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done

8783986 brutal said further bureau mergers and cuts were being considered
8783987 we have got a problem now with the company it is being run by people who dont have ink in their veins
8783988 and this latest act is basically bowing to the market and saying weve got a market downturn here and what do we do we reach for the knife this is really a pretty brutal way of doing it
8783989 in discussion that weve had in the last couple of days theyve said not only the canberra bureaux of the two great newspapers are on the table but also so too are foreign bureaux
8783990 current economic turbulence and changes reinforce the importance of continued investment in our brands experience of our management and sound fiscal management chairman gerry harvey said today

8783999 on the basis of the physical damage to the aircrafts forward cargo hold and cabin it is evident that the number 4 passenger oxygen cylinder sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurized contents julian walsh acting atsb executive director said today
8784000 the passengers were obviously very lucky atsb investigator julian walsh said in canberra
8784001 it was evident that one passenger oxygen cylinder had sustained a sudden failure and forceful discharge of its pressurised contents into the aircraft hold rupturing the fuselage in the vicinity of the wing fuselage leading edge fairing
8784002 the cylinder had been propelled upward by the force of the discharge puncturing the cabin floor and entering the cabin adjacent to the second main cabin door
8784003 the cylinder had subsequently impacted the door frame door handle and overhead panelling before falling to the cabin floor and exiting the aircraft through the ruptured fuselage
8784004 these oxygen bottles are actually quite robust so it would take some significant force to do some damage like that
8784005 theres nothing at this stage that the atsb can identify that could have been done to prevent this we dont really know why the bottle failed thats the key question for the investigation
8784006 anythings possible its certainly a rare event but no one can discount the possibility of those sort of things happening mr walsh said
8784007 as far as we can tell from all the information thats available to us the crew have pretty much done a textbook response mr walsh said
8784008 this 300m so far that we have collected by way of additional tax on this category of drinks goes straight back to the hand of the distillers rather than going to programs like that he said on fairfax radio
8784009 if the liberals proceed with blocking this in the senate as they seem to be doing then that 300m then gets anchored into the back pocket of the distillers because thats what happens
8784010 our members do not seek to profit from a situation in which the government is forced to return tax revenues collected without senate approval distilled spirits industry council of australia spokesman stephen riden said
8784011 if and when enabling legislation is rejected by the senate all revenue gained from this poorly conceived tax trial should be returned to the community for use in alcohol related harm minimisation programs
8784012 the 200m collected to date would make a huge impact if directed towards community based education and intervention programs
8784013 it opens the road for all of latin america to start visualizing legal paths to abortion
8784014 this tragedy we are living in mexico city is going to spread to other states
8784015 this decision was in regard to mexico citys legislative assembly but in the end it establishes a precedent that can be applied to other local lawmaking bodies
8784016 its not up to the supreme court to legalize or criminalize abortion
8784017 they are just encouraging women to be dirty and loose
8784018 the justices decision is only going to spread more irresponsible behavior
8784019 there are regions affected by the storm that our teams have not been able to reach
8784020 the majority of victims died when their houses collapsed or were killed by falling trees others drowned when they tried to cross swollen rivers
8784021 regardless of its predicted path it is important for citizens in the
8784022 to faithfully adhere to and abide by ones company policies objectives and guidelines
8784023 most summer associates and law students are on facebook and so are our associates
8784024 so we thought a facebook page would be a good way of enhancing the firms image in terms of being accessible
8784025 the new series of torchwood is hugely bold and promises to be bigger and better than ever the audience is in for an amazing ride
8784026 this series is one big serial and the most ambitious story weve ever made and weve got plenty of surprises in store
8784027 the last time i was here i was performing at the grand which is always fantastic and i actually performed as the invisible man
8784028 i really love coming to the old place because the people are fantastic and they are always so enthusiastic theres been a doctor who museum here for years and the love for the show around here is amazing
8784029 plus youre taking time away from your clients your colleagues your family
8784030 there is no longer the assumption that law firms are inherently stable immune from debt overload market influences and other financial disasters
8784031 every year the financial information becomes more transparent and so the level of knowledge that lawyers have about how their firm fares compared to competitors increases every year
8784032 we have seen lateral partner deals that would typically have closed in the first quarter of 2008 pushed out to the second and third quarters
8784033 the movement is really its no surprise from the old line san francisco firms to the newcomers
8784034 we see them moving to other firms we have conversations with them
8784035 theyre thinking harder about the firms strategy and which practice areas are important to the firm
8784036 clients are under pressure to consolidate their work with as few law firms as possible
8784037 id love to give you our employment work but your firm is too expensive
8784038 this year so many firms arent profitable or arent profitable enough for that to be a meaningful number that its changed the dynamics
8784039 its one less factor keeping people in their own firm
8784040 we may see fewer moves in the fourth quarter of 2008 because the firms will want to defer costs until 2009
8784041 its not about money its not about money at all
8784042 motherland fatherland whatever you want to call it these are things that are very important to people

8784047 ayer el hospital regional de r o gallegos amaneci convulsionado tras la llegada de cinco efectivos de la polic a que intentaron llevar al neurocirujano javier mart nez a la comisar a 1
8784048 todo el conflicto se inici antes de ayer cuando tuve una paciente siete horas internada que deb a ser operada porque ten a una herida abierta
8784049 estuvo siete horas acostada y no se present ninguna autoridad del hospital que me explique por qu yo no pude ingresar ese paciente al quir fano estuve con un escribano p blico intentando que buonomo me diera explicaciones pero ni se dign a atendernos y el director del hospital tampoco
8784050 a la paciente tuve que darla de alta y operarla ayer en medisur cl nica privada la oper sin honorarios por la verg enza que sent de la situaci n angustiante que vivi esa mujer
8784051 esto no esta pasando s lo conmigo esta pasando con otros m dicos
8784052 por lo tanto no es un servicio y se nombra a un encargado que lo designa el doctor buonomo quien incorpor al doctor n stor sosa
8784053 we cant go on with double digit increases as far as the eye can see
8784054 a critical priority for management now is managing expectations and educating partners that some small percentage drop in profits is not the end of the world
8784055 firms are really struggling with what their numbers need to be
8784056 they need to think about a variety of practice areas instead of going to a firm thinking its real estate or bust
8784057 i think its fair to say that as a general rule 2nd circuit courts tend to be more protective of copyright owners rights than many courts in the 9th circuit
8784058 if you plot the results the 9ths results tend to be more favorable to the rights of the alleged infringer
8784059 its the first one to thoroughly deal with the copyright issues related to user generated content
8784060 if its considered by other courts it could have a big influence
8784061 its a terrific defense side win it should be heartening to youtube and more generally to other companies like them
8784062 the record presented demonstrates that far from encouraging copyright infringement veoh has a strong dmca policy takes active steps to limit incidents of infringement on its web site and works diligently to keep unauthorized works off its web site
8784063 it is great to see the court confirm that the dmca protects services like youtube that follow the law and respect copyrights
8784064 even if the veoh decision were to be considered by other courts that case does nothing to change the fact that youtube is a business built on infringement that has failed to take reasonable measures to respect the rights of creators and content owners
8784065 we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8784066 on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
8784067 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8784068 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8784069 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8784070 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time
8784071 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
8784072 when john mccain said we could just muddle through in afghanistan i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists that actually attacked us on 9 11
8784073 you know john mccain likes to say he will follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8784074 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
8784075 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8784076 doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8784077 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000
8784078 john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies all over again
8784079 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man
8784080 if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8784081 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8784082 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done

8784125 cuando era amateur ganaba con relativa facilidad eso te hace pensar que eres especial y que el resto no lo es pero cuando te has enfrentado tantas veces a la carrera con la que llevas so ando toda tu vida y al final la consigues la saboreas de manera pausada lo analizas desde todos esos momentos en los que lo has pasado mal

8784139 but i would not think we would need to go out and get another quarterback to be our starter before opening day if lightning strikes thats a possibility but thats not what were looking to do right now
8784140 i think joe is in a place where he can come back and compete for us as an opening day starter
8784141 well have to see in the next four or five days but hes acclimating himself very well
8784142 one of the dilemmas you get caught in here is that in these economic times demand for services is going up
8784143 we have pretty substantial changes to make here but were a big county we have a big budget and were financially stable its about how do we change what we do now to make it better or how do we decide not to do some things in the future that we do now
8784144 i dont want budget cuts put on the backs of child protection workers
8784145 in child protection we better know what we need to do because children will pay
8784146 for the lack of a better word waste around here people who are just staying and staying and staying
8784147 we cant just say we have a lot of dead wood out there i dont think we know that
8784148 its a complicated system and id like us to assess that so we can say with some confidence whether that is true
8784149 isnt any fat in this organization in any organization this size there clearly is some
8784150 i dont think its a big piece of this budget
8784151 why do we act surprised when god decides to punish naughty kids
8784152 our team is pretty even through the lineup any guy in the top eight can beat anyone else on any given day
8784153 everyone had an off night then we had a guy come through with a decent score
8784154 i started out the year as our 3 man and it went downhill from there
8784155 after my first tee shot thursday i knew it was going to be a good day
8784156 weve got at least two freshmen and a sophomore getting substantial practice and match experience
8784157 were going to have two lanes up by thanksgiving and it will stay open through the winter it will go down again next spring to finish up the work

8784160 shes a highly physical player and a very talented player shes a burner shes very very fast shes a track star and we put those legs to very good use
8784161 i think we really underestimated the speed of their team
8784162 they played very well on this fast field field turf we completely underestimated their ball skills and their speed so that put us back on our heels in the first half we adjusted some personnel in the second half
8784163 we came out well in the first half and were supporting each other well we came out aggressive and i think we got tired and we let down for a little bit and thats what hurt us

8784176 it was a much better performance today the score was 3 3 which isnt much different to the other day young matildas lost 4 3 on wednesday but the quality of play was much better today kyah simon 2 and emily van egmond scored the goals but we dominated for maybe 70 of play today from that point of view the scoreline might have been disappointing
8784177 young ashley sykes the dubbo girl had a one on one with a minute to go but the keeper put on a good save so maybe we could have nicked it but overall it was a much better performance today
8784178 we had five or six girls who are a real threat going forward kyah simon nsw is fantastic emily van egmond nsw young sam kerr wa theresa polias nsw and ange formida sa so weve got five or six who are really dangerous who can strike from anywhere

8784243 i really struggled and made too many unforced errors and my serve was not working really well
8784244 obviously its very frustrating because i know i can play so much better
8784245 obviously if you would ask me at the moment if im playing like number one probably not but i cant judge too much on that because i really havent had a chance to practice
8784246 this kind of loss i had today is just incentive to work harder to go back on the court and to keep working hard and practising and improving
8784247 today i didnt feel it and also the last match was good so im just happy to be back on track without pain now all i have to do is put some hard yards on the court and go back out there and work hard
8784248 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8784249 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8784250 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8784251 these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8784252 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8784253 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8784254 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
8784255 in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition

8784258 canada needs a sharper focus on the new economy of ideas and the rights of knowledge workers
8784259 over the past decade successive governments have talked up the knowledge economy but directed policy and legislation have been woefully lacking we are in serious danger of being left in the dust of the global marketplace
8784260 pwac has consulted with government after government on copyright reform and cultural funding
8784261 just when we get a copyright bill to consider and shape it looks like it will die on the order paper because of an election how long will the country wait for another such bill and how far behind the rest of the world will we fall in the meantime
8784262 its time for all of canadas politicians to get serious about culture as business
8784263 canada should be leading the way not joining the knowledge economy third world

8784271 even though we didnt make it to the super bowl that year that was my super bowl i never seen anything like that and i was just happy to see people out in the streets just happy to see the saints play that day thats probably one thing ill always remember about new orleans is that day
8784272 there are some areas where it looks like it happened yesterday
8784273 those are houses people used to live in and theyre not living there any more so where are they
8784274 i felt like we were all kind of in this thing together
8784275 im trying to rebuild my career coming off the injury and changing teams kind of a fresh start for me a fresh start for the organization and a fresh start for the city
8784276 the more you talk to people and the more you drive around i think you just feel like life is back
8784277 when the storm happened your mind set had to be were going to make things better than they were before were going to try to turn this into a positive somehow some way i see that happening in a lot of areas so just to kind of be there and just feel like youre kind of a part of the rebuilding process is rewarding

8784407 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8784408 we have serious grounds to think that there were u s citizens right in the combat zone
8784409 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
8784410 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8784411 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8784412 it seems like an easy solution in reality it turns out that its not always so
8784413 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
8784414 it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8784415 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8784416 we try and keep our industry out of politics and into marketing opportunities but sometimes its very difficult to separate the two

8784443 think of what the percentage would be if hed been there for the last 8 years
8784444 its time for them to own their failure its time for us to change america and thats why im running for the president of the united states
8784445 its not that mccain doesnt care he just doesnt know
8784446 i guess every small business that makes gross 250 000 is going to get screwed in czar husseins america

8784459 the call comes and it comes to plenty of guys every year
8784460 they are going to go with the 53 they think are best thats just it you know it going in
8784461 you know it doesnt change from the first time i had to do it to where im at now
8784462 its absolutely the worst thing i have to do guys give you everything theyve got from march 24 they go through the offseason programs the otas organized team activities summer camp preseason games some guys are rookies and obviously some guys have been in the league for a while 10 to 15 years and youve got to let them know they dont have a job thats pretty hard
8784463 you always tell yourself not to worry about it because you dont make the call its not your decision
8784464 you try not to think about it but its hard not to especially if you didnt get the reps in practice like you thought its hard to show what you can do with only two or three plays every day
8784465 i feel like under the circumstances ive done as well as i can
8784466 im happy with it obviously you wish you could have more of an impact but thats why tonights game is so important to me
8784467 it was hard there for a while to keep my focus on what i was supposed to be doing but the last couple weeks ive been a little more focused and trying to work through it all but i cant lie those first two weeks it was a struggle to stay focused but we all understand what happens now
8784468 but you let them know why youre not necessarily always right but you try to give them an idea a reason why they didnt make the team some guys really want to talk and some guys just want to get up and go everybodys a little different

8784475 if you win most of your getaway day games youll be in the hunt
8784476 it was something i emphasized to the team during spring training
8784477 winning on the last day sometimes prevents sweeps sometimes puts you in a sweep position but most of the time it determines whether you win or lose a series because most series are three games
8784478 its the toughest game to play especially the last game of a trip
8784479 guys think about going home after being on the road a long time 10 days this time i guess what you have to do is pretend youre not going home or not going to the next city

8784481 if you win the majority of your getaway days i guarantee you youd be in the hunt
8784482 aaron threw a great game other than three solo home runs
8784483 we have to show more offense than that quintero hits his second home run both against us
8784484 were getting good pitching now and we just have to figure out a way to get some more base hits they had 17 hits in three games in houston
8784485 we have to remain alert on the bases and alert period
8784486 we have to increase intensity and increase alertness we told them before the game this guy quintero likes to throw over our coaches try to prepare em as best as possible
8784487 you have to always know where the ball is this is part of the learning process we must continue to teach some of these things you figure the guys know already especially if youve already warned them
8784488 it is so basic and so fundamental keep your head up and be alert at all times
8784489 i was lazy and lackadaisical i just didnt anticipate a throw the way the game turned out one run defeat made it a big big play
8784490 i like it anywhere as long as it is out there in the dirt
8784491 i was checking out the speed of the last pitch it said 94 but it appeared to me like it was 104
8784492 the game kind of sped up on me and thats the challenge of being up here
8784493 i have to slow it down once you learn how to do that youll have your feet on the ground and be rolling
8784494 i tend to put a lot of pressure on myself
8784495 im appreciative for the shot at this and i have to take it just like any other baseball game
8784496 just a day off to let edwin get together his thoughts
8784497 i dont go into games thinking about my record against them

8784539 theres nothing really new to report on senator mccains decision i think well all hear from him shortly and hopefully well be able to move forward together
8784540 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8784541 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000
8784542 john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies all over again

8784552 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8784553 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8784554 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8784555 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8784556 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8784557 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time

8784574 if you people at the curb arent into dying you know laying on the ground and everything you could just stumble around and throw up if youd like
8784575 as you know im a believer and ive never pretended not to be and i respect those who have no religious belief its a free country mr rudd said
8784576 for me its ultimately the order of the cosmos or what i describe as the creation
8784577 you cant simply have in my own judgment creation simply being a random event because it is so inherently ordered and the fact that the natural environment is being ordered where it can properly coexist over time
8784578 if you were simply reducing that to mathematically probabilities ive got to say it probably wouldnt have happened
8784579 so i think there is an intelligent mind at work
8784580 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction

8784582 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president
8784583 our nation was enjoying peace and prosperity and some assumed we would continue both no matter the outcome but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8784584 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
8784585 before he entered the white house abraham lincolns experience in elective office consisted of eight years in his state legislature in springfield illinois and one term in congress during which he showed courage and wisdom to oppose the invasion of another country in a war that was popular when it started but later condemned by history the experience that lincolns supporters valued most in that race was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
8784586 he was known chiefly as a clear thinker and a great orator with a passion for justice and a determination to heal the deep divisions of our land he insisted on reaching past partisan and regional divides to exalt our common humanity
8784587 as we bow in reverence remember the words of the old proverb
8784588 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
8784589 it is with profound grace and humility that i accept your nomination
8784590 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story
8784591 because next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
8784592 and we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8784593 i don t know about you but i m not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8784594 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so don t tell me that democrats won t defend this country
8784595 don t tell me that democrats won t keep us safe
8784596 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
8784597 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8784598 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness

8784611 this is the best i have felt since early in houston
8784612 i have played decent games where i have not felt good
8784613 i felt i sporadically made plays and things lucked into happening tonight i was in control of what was going on and that hasnt happened in a long time
8784614 when the regular season starts its a whole new ballgame
8784615 we know that is it nice to win the games yeah but it doesnt mean anything weve had good records in preseason weve had bad records in preseason what counts is how you play in the regular season
8784616 we still have a lot of work to do and we have to get better
8784617 the preseason is over and kansas city is coming in we have to be ready nobody is waiting for us we had a bad day but we have to put that behind us there are no concerns we have to move forward and move on
8784618 hopefully getting past these barriers mentally and numbers wise we can put that in the past and become the organization were envisioned on becoming
8784619 i think you have to give those guys some credit over there
8784620 theyve got a pretty good pitching staff that will shut you down
8784621 i made a couple of mistake pitches and they hit them over the fence
8784622 when youre talking about the best athlete in the world i think it needs to be somebody thats well rounded that can do everything well
8784623 i just dont think you can call him the worlds greatest athlete
8784624 having your picture on the wheaties box is something all athletes strive for
8784625 its a mark of distinction that says youve reached the pinnacle of your career this is a very special honor for me
8784626 filtering out the gossip medias take on what i said about angelina and brad
8784627 this is what i really said no decent human who stands in support of helping the worlds orphans and downtrodden can possibly help to continue bushs war against the poor
8784628 are they keeping more of their money and not paying us taxes
8784629 we have a lot of tough decisions ahead of us with the back end of the roster so i wanted to give those guys an opportunity and you cant do that without giving them reps
8784630 i think they drafted me for a reason ill go watch film and wait
8784631 now well go back evaluate the film and make cuts but there are some guys here that really showed well for themselves and guys that didnt
8784632 i think i have progressed every game throughout the preseason that was my goal if i can continue to do that then hopefully ill have a great career here
8784633 we wanted to come out and give a great show for the fans and i think we did some great things on defense and some good things on offense
8784634 its a big ball game for this team and for south florida and an opportunity for us to go up there and play a great opponent
8784635 theyve got a tremendous offense tremendous defense and we feel great for the chance to go up there and play such a great team
8784636 i put my teammates in positions that they could make plays not me
8784637 i learned if i could give the ball to my teammates everything will be ok i dont need to be the one going out there making spectacular plays
8784638 it felt like we had a junior or senior out there playing quarterback
8784639 i dont have it lingering over my head will he get reinstated will he not get reinstated i just have to keep myself out of bad situations like i have been doing the last six or seven months
8784640 immediately i called my mom because ive been beating myself up but my mom has been through this roller coaster with me
8784641 adam has worked hard to get to this point but he also knows that there is still a lot of work ahead of him
8784642 he is fully aware of the opportunity that he has been given and he knows that this is an ongoing process
8784643 i have to conduct myself like an nfl player to make sure none of these actions come again
8784644 i work hard every day to make sure i dont make the same mistakes can i say i would never ever make the same mistakes no i cant say that ill make sure i put myself in way better situations than i have put myself in the past
8784645 surrounding myself around the right people and staying out of gentlemens clubs having a great relationship with god and spending more time with my family
8784646 i think from the beginning there were a lot of critics saying that this couldnt be done that he couldnt turn his life around
8784647 im very happy for adam hes proven everyone wrong hes got a very bright personal and professional future
8784648 it is good for them to help players learn english when i learned english i became a better player but to suspend them i dont think so
8784649 we have been puzzled if not surprised by some of the reactions
8784650 you have to interact effectively with your pro am partners you need to be able to do media interviews and you need to give a winners acceptance speech in english
8784651 they must speak at a level that effectively accomplishes those three things
8784652 what were seeing is that a handful of players dont speak to the level they need to be
8784653 he didnt say anything about it but we kind of knew
8784654 some hard coaching was going on a little more coaching than normal in the last preseason game so we kind of knew what the deal was
8784655 but we wanted him coming back to get a win for him
8784656 i would love to have had them play the whole game
8784657 and just grind it out and work and get into some rhythm things like that but that would not have been smart
8784658 everybody is excited the guys were talking about it on the sideline its time to stop just practicing and playing for fun and start playing for real
8784659 theres just too many issues with this offense for people to deal with
8784660 we had two and a half weeks to deal with it the rest of these folks will get two days good luck acc
8784661 had dwyer in our sights about three times and just couldnt tackle him
8784662 we are a team that is very young and new to the big scene
8784663 41 points is a lot better than 14 im sure of that an ugly win is better than a pretty loss
8784664 in this offense you dont know when someone is going to break a long run
8784665 there would be no reason for florida to extradite david on this offense
8784666 convicted of dealing in stolen property and burglary both felonies as well as larceny and possession of marijuana
8784667 its basically the odds of society not an unusual circumstance

8784711 the mall is a quiet area and this would not be a quiet area
8784712 there would be noise there and a lot of hollering and shouting and thats different than the kids at the playground at the far end
8784713 on the other side of the park is a playground and a basketball court and the studies that have been done on skate plazas have shown that theyre not any louder than any other public facility like that
8784714 you know the problem here being next to a memorial facility
8784715 theres probably not going to be anyone here to police any activities that desecrate the memorials of the veterans
8784716 if you tuck a park like this away in behind buildings it will be vandalized
8784717 what we found in all our research and we have researched for 15 months parks all across the united states if they are in visible spots kids love them
8784718 it is very important to dispose of it properly i used to put them in the bathroom
8784719 we dont want people disposing of medications at home for example down the toilet or the garbage disposal because we dont want these medications getting into the groundwater

8784761 he was such an upbeat guy that his friends brought their problems to him
8784762 mr campbell was a member of the church for more than 40 years
8784763 he served the church very well as an elder and attended worship almost every week he was a real example of christian strength
8784764 despite his handicap mr campbell was a very lively guy
8784765 he would get to bible study at 6 a m and make most of the family events at the church
8784766 everybody knew him for his corny jokes and his lively ways
8784767 but he was a very gentle soul meek in the biblical sense of the word
8784768 my dad was first in his class at culinary school at fort meade
8784769 we would get off the bus and dad would tell me which way to go he was so good he gave other people directions
8784770 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8784771 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000
8784772 john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies all over again
8784773 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man
8784774 if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8784775 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve experienced in the history of humankind
8784776 not only in the heat of this election but in the aftermath as we put his agenda to work for our country
8784777 has taught him something that career politicians often overlook that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance
8784778 we did not want to throw into six man coverage at that point so we called a play that we could run out the clock and maybe have a chance to break it off big
8784779 it can be a strange game sometimes with the way things turn out
8784780 i just told the kids to go out and have fun
8784781 i didnt want the kids to come out here and put a lot of pressure on themselves theyve had to learn a new offense and a new defense it was a lot for everyone so i just told them to come out and not worry about making mistakes
8784782 obviously we were motivated because they beat us last year but were just taking care of business out here
8784783 everything clicked we had so many open spaces the line was blocking and the receivers were running crisp routes
8784784 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8784785 most alarmingly it seems to be affecting young childrens breathing and several children have been hospitalised usually overnight over the last week as a precaution
8784786 we did have a staff member admitted to hospital for a couple of nights as well but shes home now
8784787 today we have 271 students absent and 20 staff including 11 classroom teachers
8784788 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8784789 when blood cholesterol was measured at both six weeks and twelve weeks both groups showed either no change or a reduction particularly in their ldl bad cholesterol levels despite the egg group increasing their dietary cholesterol intake to around four times that of the control
8784790 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8784791 the biggest advantage to dfd rendering lies in the fact that observers do not have to wear encumbering glasses to view the 3d scene
8784792 although traditional auto stereo displays and volumetric displays also exhibit this quality their inherent technology limits their usability autostereo displays allow for a limited number of views and volumetric displays are usually enclosed within some space which users cannot or should not interact with dfd displays allow for many views and interaction as long as a user is reliably tracked
8784793 for true realism a 3d object should appear exactly where it is expected regardless of what the user is actually doing
8784794 factors like occlusion projection bleed through projector camera calibration errors and dynamic scenes make this an extremely challenging issue coupling this with errors introduced by even the best tracking solutions on the market and an expert user will begin to notice the slight errors in imagery and user to scene registration for our research we used the best available immaterial display the fogscreen but display improvements would definitely improve the fidelity of images and interaction
8784795 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8784796 there is nothing major to feel concerned about but he has been admitted to the lilivati hospital in mumbai because he was feeling some discomfort in his abdomen
8784797 the dalai lama will be examined by doctors tomorrow friday
8784798 theres a sense of not only pride but of a point in the culture were a part of the society were a part of that this is different
8784799 its a measure of how far we and i dont mean just black people how far this country and the business world have come
8784800 when you grow up living in a white corporate world theres always a part of you that thinks gee if i sold out or how can i do this and also stay true to myself and true to my own identity
8784801 here we have a guy whos running for president and managed to do it in the political world and managed to do it so well
8784802 this is now a situation where many of us have arrived at a certain level lawyers doctors professional people
8784803 and all of that is coming together around this very special individual
8784804 there was just a tone in her voice youre really not supposed to be here for an appointment that early
8784805 o you who believe fasting is prescribed to you as it was prescribed to those before you so that you can learn taqwa
8784806 what a great come from behind win just a great win i mean exciting
8784807 this place really got loud i dont know if it was the loudest ive heard it but let me tell you what it was loud
8784808 i mean ive been able to do that since i was in the minor leagues
8784809 ive always been able to drive in runs its something im proud of and i like to be in that situation late in the game
8784810 fontenot hit a homer and all of a sudden its a two run game and we got the top of our lineup coming soriano got on base and theriot got on base we got a good team
8784811 we shouldnt be going through this this is our time to hold these leads and its our job were not getting it done right now
8784812 yeah to think about how well cole threw the ball and how well our guys put at bats up against dempster its a tough one
8784813 that was a situation where we couldnt get people out actually the last game and most of the last games that weve lost thats kind of how its been
8784814 its better than a baby step but its a first step
8784815 thats probably the worst thing you can say about their performance
8784816 it was all my fault its something i need to correct its the one thing i gave them that cost us
8784817 we had a good performance last week one and done this week
8784818 hes just got a bruise he really could have finished
8784819 were disappointed that we couldnt get the ball in the end zone but sometimes when you play a preseason opponent in the regular season youre going to be selective about what youre doing as they were

8784830 i would be shocked if hes not there a week from sunday
8784831 he would have to have a dramatic setback right now every step weve taken has been good
8784832 he wanted to see how loose hed be after the wait in the locker room that type of thing
8784833 we had an exercise bike out there for him but i think hes pretty happy with how the routine went
8784834 i should have been with you the past few days
8784835 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8784836 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain
8784837 the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8784838 from the temple grounds barack obama will outline an agenda for america that includes raising taxes increasing spending putting government bureaucrats in charge of health care and isolating america from the benefits of the global economy
8784839 while barack obama will talk about his plans to tax the rich and cut taxes on the middle class he will not say that his record includes voting for higher taxes 94 times and voting for a tax increase on those making just 42 000 per year
8784840 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8784841 barack obama voted against providing 94 4 billion in critical funding for the troops in iraq and afghanistan
8784842 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow but i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet 21st century challenges with a 20th century bureaucracy
8784843 i do not make a promise that we can reduce it by 2013 because i think it is important for us to make some critical investments right now in americas families
8784844 ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars
8784845 and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and 5 million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8784846 talked loosely about the same old democratic solutions that have failed
8784847 does evil exist and if it does do we ignore it do we negotiate with it do we contain it do we defeat it
8784848 would people really rather have mr 894 out of 899 than
8784849 ed rapuano was the plate umpire funny thing was he got hurt and brian runge had to come in and work the plate and he had the same strike zone
8784850 make sure everyone watching at home is going to have a clear sense of where he wants to take the country
8784851 now you can hear that a train is approaching or is arriving
8784852 but well be able to give a more precise countdown so you know that the next train is coming and its going to braintree but its also four minutes away
8784853 its working great but to put that at 8 000 locations would be cost prohibitive
8784854 the green line offers unique challenges because its both above and below ground
8784855 i guess he liked the part where i was dead because i couldnt be asked about it talk about an evil genius
8784856 and this guy i had never heard of walked up and gave the most mind blowing speech and now four years later to see barack obama onstage here in denver as the democratic candidate for president well its completely amazing
8784857 its just outrageous that the person who actually pulled the trigger is out walking
8784858 im not here to win the starter job or the back up job im just here in case something god awful happens i can go in there and not screw it up
8784859 bud caulfield said st onge died suddenly at around 10 p m in his home on andover street in lowell
8784860 our hearts and prayers go out to his family caulfield said last night
8784861 kill all the rich people bring the revolution home kill your parents
8784862 kill all the rich people break up their cars and apartments bring the revolution home kill your parents
8784863 wed proven that it was possible we didnt all die we were still there
8784864 participated in the bombings of new york city police headquarters in 1970 of the capitol building in 1971 and the pentagon in 1972
8784865 everything was absolutely ideal the sky was blue the birds were singing and the bastards were finally going to get what was coming to them
8784866 theres something about a good bomb night after night day after day each majestic scene i witnessed was so terrible and so unexpected that no city would ever again stand innocently fixed in my mind big buildings and wide streets cement and steel were no longer permanent they too were fragile and destructible a torch a bomb a strong enough wind and they too would come undone or get knocked down
8784867 guilty as sin free as a bird america is a great country
8784868 while our actions bore the precise stamp of a cut diamond terrorists intimidate while we aimed only to educate
8784869 this is a time not only of great stress and oppression and authoritarianism and a kind of rising incipient american form of fascism and what the government counts on what the powerful count on is that we will stay quiet its the idea that we can tolerate these intolerable things without screaming without somehow coming out joining up and coming out and saying something its what they count on in terms of keeping things under control
8784870 empire resurrected and unapologetic war without end an undefined enemy thats supposed to be a rallying point for a new kind of energized jingoistic patriotism unprecedented and unapologetic military expansion white supremacy changing its form but essentially intact attacks on women and girls violent attacks growing surveillance in every sphere of our lives on and on and on the targeting of gay and lesbian people as a kind of a scapegoating gesture to keep our minds off of whats really happening
8784871 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8784872 america our work will not be easy the challenges we face require tough choices and democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the worn out ideas and politics of the past
8784873 suppose for example youre a voter and you have candidate x and you have candidate y
8784874 candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that person can deliver on anything candidate y disagrees with you on half the issues but you believe that on the other half the candidate will be able to deliver for whom will you vote
8784875 i wouldnt go to the races and sit in the stands all sunday long with the kids youre at your trailer your home your bathroom all your food is there
8784876 its like living in a little city theres just so much going on all the time
8784877 rv guests are a huge part of what makes a race weekend special
8784878 we get together and we talk about racing and we have some beer and cocktails everybodys got their flags up and their nascar shirts on and their hats on and its all good fun
8784879 i like earnhardt junior everybody does and im starting to like robby gordon
8784880 its easier now to say who my least favorite driver is
8784881 youve got all that horsepower it wakes you up in the morning youre vibrating all day long
8784882 ill cook up like a 16 17 pound prime rib for four or five hours
8784883 i have the tv but i dont need to watch the race its just fun being there
8784884 its a lot cheaper than staying in a hotel and then youre eating out
8784885 we have big cookouts people have water guns squirting each other
8784886 weve talked about it but when it comes down to it
8784887 that is the reason why you go so hard in the off season
8784888 this is the time you like to show it everybody is fresh in the first half when other guys get tired thats when im at my strongest
8784889 usually youre in a pennant race and im in those races its different right now
8784890 certainly i feel very bad about what has happened we didnt expect to include
8784891 ethier has been pretty consistent he gives you the threat of a home run too even if you lose the speed kemp seems to be maturing into something special
8784892 im not sure if ardoin and berroa are going to add to the probability of getting people on base
8784893 i couldnt care less if they dont have major leaguers
8784894 the biggest tragedy is theyre getting rid of softball whats the excuse for that were not sending major leaguers
8784895 we wanted to make sure that the treatment and control groups were as alike as possible
8784896 kids can withdraw money as soon as they have it
8784897 none of us can provide a cast iron guarantee that salmonella saintpaul will not re emerge
8784898 is an important indication that this particular outbreak is over

8784901 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8784902 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes

8784905 whatever was going to blow away has already blown away
8784906 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
8784907 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 per cent
8784908 it is simply impossible to determine exactly where and when gustav will make final landfall
8784909 the chances of hurricane force winds within the next five days are essentially the same at each individual location from the florida panhandle coast westward through the entire coastline of louisiana
8784910 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8784911 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination
8784912 i was a little shocked when they told me id been chosen
8784913 i once literally saw an iraqi general with a suitcase of money
8784914 more and more the only thing that seemed to make sense was that it was about oil
8784915 iraq really opened my eyes to the link between our foreign policy and our energy policy
8784916 whatever other benefits there are to reducing our use of fossil fuels its all about providing security for our nation
8784917 i also was really attracted by obamas post partisan message im tired of the bickering
8784918 it wasnt easy it was a really big deal for my family telling my dad i was voting for a democrat
8784919 but most of all i want to ask him about forming a manhattan project for green energy i see that as our most important priority
8784920 we were so close we could read it off the teleprompters
8784921 im a lot more comfortable playing tight end than i thought id be
8784922 im still learning a ton every day just all the different fronts you never have to deal with out at wide receiver but the basic stuff im pretty comfortable with all that
8784923 hes a guy we have a lot of confidence in you throw him the ball hes going to catch it hes going to make the right reads and run the route he needs to run

8784925 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
8784926 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
8784927 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
8784928 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

8784965 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8784966 that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8784967 our government should work for us not against us it should help us not hurt us it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every american whos willing to work
8784968 thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what the change would mean if im president
8784969 in the way your faith tradition would close your prayer
8784970 i would be shocked if hes not there a week from sunday
8784971 he would have to have a dramatic setback right now every step weve taken has been good
8784972 he wanted to see how loose hed be after the wait in the locker room that type of thing
8784973 we had an exercise bike out there for him but i think hes pretty happy with how the routine went
8784974 what we wanted to do was really kind of simulate what he was going to do on game day see how everything felt and see if he wanted to alter his routine for next sunday
8784975 i think he came away feeling pretty good about it he told me on the sidelines that if he started he would have felt in good shape and ready to go

8784992 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8784993 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8784994 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8784995 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8784996 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8784997 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8784998 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8784999 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8785000 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8785001 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8785002 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8785003 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8785004 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8785005 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8785006 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
8785007 they needed a short victorious war and if it didnt work out they could always put the blame on us make us look like the enemy and against the background of this surge of patriotism once more rally the country around a particular political force
8785008 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate it just sounds not rational
8785009 those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defence officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8785010 doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8785011 we are in the process of reevaluating our relationship with russia
8785012 i dont think theres anything to announce yet but i know that that is under discussion
8785013 the humanitarian needs of conflict victims and those displaced by recent violence in georgia
8785014 i dont think anyone should be looking for a new cold war
8785015 what we would like to see is the return to the status quo before august 7th and the hostilities began before russia invaded georgia before the disproportional response to the regular flare ups that happen in the summertime out in that area
8785016 what we would like to see is a return to a place where we can have integration of russia into the international community unfortunately its russia that made the choice to take several steps backward in that regard
8785017 air quality is an issue of great importance to allegheny county residents
8785018 this was the last piece of overhauling the air quality program that had to be done
8785019 he was a born leader everything he joined he always became head of it
8785020 he was one of the best organized people ive ever seen and one of the hardest workers i dont think there is a single lawyer in fayette county who would not recognize him as one of the most distinguished lawyers who ever worked here
8785021 he was a fierce lawyer to face he never backed off
8785022 he had a strong work ethic and integrity and when he spotted another gentleman with those qualities that drew him to him
8785023 exemplifies the spirit of volunteering themselves to better the community
8785024 it doesnt really matter as long as i get my education
8785025 the education being afforded is excellent and parents understand that
8785026 i knew i wanted to continue to serve low income families and particularly have focus in early childhood education
8785027 it seemed to be a perfect fit because pittsburgh is such a well known community in the nonprofit world
8785028 its so rewarding to work at a place thats concerned with helping the community meet these needs that may otherwise go unmet
8785029 i think that is different than a lot of cities you dont have that feel
8785030 ive had some really great opportunities just in my short year here
8785031 the grand jury learned that during an executive session of borough council piroli made his displeasure known and required that chief joseph deluca remove officer dawn shane from the investigation
8785032 piroli based his demand in part upon his fears that officer shanes diligent investigation would ruin his life
8785033 i have no support for that other than the alleged statement of the young man
8785034 may have been in her apartment at least on one occasion
8785035 her father said to me this was our dream for our child she got a great career shes in a nice little community shes in a school where they like her shes teaching at the highest level at the school
8785036 they have whole cloth made up this idea that shes been with groups of young men that story has nothing behind it
8785037 theyre dressed theyre appropriate no one ever said they werent no one every said they were disheveled
8785038 on the basis of the physical damage to the aircrafts forward cargo hold and cabin it is evident that the number 4 passenger oxygen cylinder sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurized contents
8785039 the preliminary report was a factual account of the incident and investigation to date
8785040 this is about bringing out the power that women have
8785041 that comes out of being more confident and more sexy
8785042 the activities deemed too provocative by adams township have become an increasingly popular form of exercise for women around the country and even in china a country not known for freedom
8785043 specifically ms babines considers pole dancing to be both an art and a sport and she believes that pole dancing demonstrates that women can be powerful physically strong and beautiful with their clothes on
8785044 we recently received information that would classify your business as an adult business because of the content of your advertising and information from your websites
8785045 she said the classes were designed to increase womens self esteem in a male dominated society she stated that ms babines never offered for sale any sexually explicit material or sex toys during her classes
8785046 he testified that regardless of whether the activity involved nudity the dance forms ms
8785047 indicated to him that she intended to operate an adult business
8785048 we looked into colors and the pink and black are used quite often in gentlemans clubs along with the stiletto heel is used commonly if you go on the internet and look at brand identity it talks about different colors
8785049 red and black are often associated with sexy and seductive and are favored by porn sites
8785050 it needs to hit the market by the end of september to take advantage of christmas sales
8785051 nokia is still having trouble making inroads in the u s
8785052 i thought how could a guy operating under this kind of pressure three hours of sleep a night produce that kind of speech
8785053 enormous ability to arouse the intense admiration and affection of his base
8785054 exactly what he means by change hope and transformation all the sort of big payoff words that appear in his speeches he has yet to clearly define
8785055 one of the dangers here is that in the effort to constantly adjust his position people then begin to wonder where his bottom line is
8785056 hes got to show that hes got a bottom line and that hes willing to fight for it
8785057 ive been in meetings with at least three different presidents
8785058 he wasnt just up to the level he was superior
8785059 obama met with the palestinians some came up afterward and were saying that they were so impressed because here was obama who had the same facility the same grasp of the issues as clinton did
8785060 and clinton had been president for a few years by the time he met with them
8785061 no question that he was a liberal as were most editors of the review and most students at harvard law at that time
8785062 but he wasnt the kind who demonized conservatives or personalized politics
8785063 doesnt sit down to convince them how smart he is
8785064 ive heard him say i just dont agree with you i think theres a different way to look at this and then make the intelligent arguments that he needs to make
8785065 im a big believer in a management style that focuses on getting the job done and doesnt focus on personal ambitions or personal hang ups
8785066 he always projected a kind of cool and a kind of reserve that masked the ambition that clearly had to be inside
8785067 there is still a great amount of caution out there
8785068 overall readings are still quite low by historical standards and it is still too early to tell if the worst is behind us
8785069 we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience and disappointment that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights
8785070 we had boarded the flight and sat for an hour and a half
8785071 we were then told we all had to disembark again
8785072 the pilot was left to tell all the passengers that there would no longer be a flight and the reasons for this
8785073 this longing for an emotion they never experienced but feel they missed is part of what brings them out in such numbers at obamas events
8785074 america we are better than the last eight years we are a better country than this
8785075 a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8785076 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8785077 likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right 95 percent of the time
8785078 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8785079 listen now i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8785080 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8785081 democrats and republicans and independents have fought together and bled together and some have died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
8785082 so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8785083 you only have so many and he has to bring that hit record again the new version
8785084 you look at all those who came before us and died for the right to vote
8785085 racism is alive and well in america but we also have to recognize that were moving forward

8785092 am 4 november m ssen wir aufstehen und sagen acht sind genug
8785093 wir messen die st rke unserer wirtschaft nicht an der zahl der milliard re die wir haben
8785094 ich werde diesen krieg im irak verantwortungsvoll beenden ebenso wie den kampf gegen al kaida und die taliban in afghanistan
8785095 work hard and give back and keep going without complaint
8785096 sits on its hands while a major american city drowns before our eyes
8785097 programs alone cant replace parents that government cant turn off the television and make a child do her homework that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need
8785098 whats so exciting about barack in these battleground states is that we have a candidate who attracts tens of thousands of volunteers
8785099 ive never seen anything like it and im a grassroots person
8785100 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8785101 the thing we struggled with was whether his personal life was you know his i think we all thought that was true on the other hand his position i guess what you do in your personal life does affect the publics perception of what you do on the job
8785102 theres nothing really new to report on senator mccains decision i think well all hear from him shortly and hopefully well be able to move forward together
8785103 to be here tonight a proud mother a proud democrat a proud new york democrat a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama
8785104 the art quilt paradox studio art quilts and contemporary quilting today
8785105 she says makes voter registration so easy a nonexistent person could be added to the voter roles
8785106 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8785107 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8785108 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8785109 the messages of hope and that american can change from the way it has been was demandingly given
8785110 its a serious long term challenge and these high achieving organisations are going to play a central role in securing indigenous peoples participation
8785111 the chief of army put up a very cogent argument that should happen to protect our troops
8785112 and we then looked at the documentation supplied in the tender package to see what could be achieved we did a paper based selection
8785113 in hindsight the mistake we made and i admit we made a mistake we should have done full tests and evaluation before we announced an award winner
8785114 we have some crews still inside trying to locate the source of it but were not having any luck
8785115 it might be that something was tipped down a drain but thats conjecture so were just trying to find out what it mightve been
8785116 that way we can prevent any repeat of the same problem in the future
8785117 weve had a number of people in specialist breathing apparatus and protective clothing theyve been unable to locate anything so were still carrying out the further investigation just to ensure everything is okay
8785118 he is improving and i suppose the other thing is he hasnt eaten of course since his problems and theyre anticipating that within three days theyll be able to start giving him solids again so thats terribly good news also
8785119 we are waiting on a report at the moment but we are looking at something not much more than if any more than 10 centre barrels
8785120 we collectively determined that we could not do it without significant risk and we werent prepared to take that risk on when there was a viable alternative
8785121 the number we are looking at rebuilding will take us through to that planned withdrawal date
8785122 lance corporal marks was killed conducting a combat operation in an extremely demanding environment
8785123 the inquiry officer looked at equipment training the operational situation and available support on the day of the incident to ascertain if there was anything that could have been done to prevent lance corporal marks death
8785124 we are worse off under mr rudd than we were under the coalition government and peters made his decision that he did not seek the leadership of the party
8785125 and as ive said before id be very happy if he changes his mind thats his business
8785126 the dinners been planned for a long time i wouldnt expect him to make any announcements about anything
8785127 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8785128 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8785129 i believe theres a long term secular trend toward handsets doing more not just calling but music video and data with more and more functionality thrown on them
8785130 it can take a long time to create a design that works and in an investment area where the costs are at the front end to make them being able to design into multiple different applications mitigates the risk that the market may end up moving on you once you get the hardware out
8785131 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8785132 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8785133 like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states red states for republicans blue states for democrats
8785134 for the first time in a long time we have the chance to build a new majority of not just democrats but independents and republicans whove lost faith in their washington leaders but want to believe again who desperately want something new
8785135 above all i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
8785136 if it didnt have a sprinkler system im not sure this building would still be standing
8785137 were hoping for an indictment against sununu but it hasnt happened yet
8785138 jeanne shaheen continues to exhibit a complete lack of integrity
8785139 and unfortunately this is but another instance of shaheens embarrassing new hampshire with outrageous and disgraceful comments
8785140 when the voters of new hampshire hold him accountable for the failed economic policies he supported in the senate
8785141 i paid 467 a month for the last two years straight for benefits for me my wife and my daughter as of sept 30 the state of new hampshire is going to cancel us
8785142 nothing that were doing is new were simply enforcing the laws that are on the books
8785143 whats new is that theres a change in the market where certain carriers are now emphasizing limited benefit plans
8785144 its being sold as a solution to the affordability problem for low wage workers
8785145 shes a part time employee at applebees so therefore she couldnt get insurance either
8785146 so far the only alternative we got was to sign up for an individual carrier which in my circumstance is 1 300 a month
8785147 we are committed to working with the department of insurance in new hampshire to come up with a plan to transition everybody through
8785148 unfortunately the health care plan we are offering across the entire country does not meet the new requirements recently enacted in new hampshire
8785149 two weeks ago its dont forget the new open enrollment get it done
8785150 then its wait a minute dont call a couple days later dont enroll there is no more coverage for you sorry
8785151 someone way up in hr human resources really dropped the ball here and didnt investigate the limits you need here in new hampshire to offer policies to your employees
8785152 i know two girls i work with who just had babies what are they supposed to do theyve got 2 1 2 weeks of coverage for a newborn
8785153 our hope is that they will allow us to provide this coverage to residents in the state
8785154 policies have to be approved by the commissioner and these were not submitted for approval
8785155 from the insurance department perspective we are more than willing to help employees out and help find them plans that can often be purchased for a similar price with a lot richer coverage
8785156 being 25 years old with two kids its not cheap to live and its not easy
8785157 it was an abnormal event even in the context of criminal law
8785158 the state alleges a very significant assault occurred here and crimes that are of serious gravity
8785159 there wont be baseball in nashua next year as we presently know it or at least under my ownership
8785160 its typical for a plaza that goes in where were in a period of slump to have empty units
8785161 and the fact that starbucks has overextended itself shouldnt worry anyone
8785162 but the economy in this part of new hampshire is really not in bad shape and the potential for development on this road hasnt come close to being reached
8785163 he came to visit me shortly after i was sworn in he came to my office all alone no aides just barack obama
8785164 dreams from my father a story of race and inheritance
8785165 i talked to him about experience and race i found him to be a person of extraordinary depth and sound judgment
8785166 i felt i was speaking to someone who was wise beyond his years
8785167 i was in the hall in 2004 for his speech and i said this man needs to be president
8785168 that barack obama could be the right candidate for a nation that needed to turn a page and move forward
8785169 weve had eight years of bellicose rhetoric and cowboy diplomacy
8785170 all they need to do is think about what john mccain means for the supreme court
8785171 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8785172 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8785173 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8785174 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8785175 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8785176 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8785177 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8785178 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8785179 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8785180 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8785181 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8785182 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8785183 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8785184 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8785185 here you go nick thats your tip for the season
8785186 ive been saving up thats everything i had in my ash tray all year
8785187 its a quick empty feeling like now what do i do
8785188 its almost like you walk off the curb and get hit by a car all of a sudden everything stops that might be a little extreme but youre so competitive every day it really takes a couple weeks after the seasons over to gear yourself down
8785189 you cherish what you have with these guys but we just spent six months together every single day
8785190 the first phone call im going to make when the season is over isnt going to be to eric nielsen or jean machi or phillips you start making those phone calls around december or january
8785191 you want to be remembered for something my whole thing is to keep the clubhouse fun keep it loose its all part of having fun in this game
8785192 we had our share of rain this year but theres nothing greater than a new england sports fan theyve showed it again they came out in record numbers the staff here deserves a lot of credit
8785193 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
8785194 and what i know is over the centuries the doctrines of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is that it shouldnt have an impact on a womans right to choose i dont think anybody can tell you when life begins human life begins
8785195 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm anti abortion attitude
8785196 human development begins at fertilization when a male gamete or sperm spermatozoon unites with a female gamete or oocyte ovum to produce a single cell a zygote this highly specialized totipotent cell marked the beginning of each of us as a unique individual
8785197 i saw a void in the republican party for candidates willing to stand up for conservative free market principles defend capitalism push for more individual liberty and consistently call for smaller government
8785198 ill run on the issues and without falling under the influence of lobbyists and special interests that paul hodes has fallen to and which the other three candidates will fall victim to
8785199 we cannot send people to washington who are constantly trying to defend the system my opponents constantly defend the system
8785200 i bring with me years of experience in the state house there are 400 members in the new hampshire house so ive had to work with a large group to get things done
8785201 all the issues these guys are working on now are issues ive been working on all these years its not new to me its not like i have to start all over who else in this race has a record of actually getting things accomplished besides me
8785202 i only knew about weed i didnt know anything about that
8785203 im so thrilled im so happy that no one else will be scammed by these two
8785204 the rye police department has learned this is not a reputable company by the arizona better business bureau and is asking residents to call if they were or are approached in the future by subjects attempting to collect donations
8785205 we want to put the word out that neighbors need to look out for each other
8785206 earwax is not intrinsically evil stuff and consequently does not have to be removed merely because its present
8785207 in fact it serves a function and so if you dont need to take it out you should just leave it alone
8785208 then there are lots of people wearing earplugs for one reason or another either because theyve got hearing aids or theyre transcriptionists at work or because theyre addicted to their walkman
8785209 and that can increase the likelihood that the wax doesnt come out on its own
8785210 the wax gets much thicker and drier and plus you actually end up with more hair in your ear when youre older and so it traps it
8785211 unfortunately many people feel the need to manually remove cerumen from the ears this can result in further impaction and other complications to the ear canal
8785212 dont put anything smaller than your elbow in your ear
8785213 if theyre going to do something at home they should probably use drops of some sort
8785214 i am glad the nfl took a second good hard look at the case
8785215 our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8785216 should mom move in with us now that dads gone fifty 60 70 dollars just to fill up the gas tank how in gods name with winter coming how are we gonna heat the home another year no raise did you hear did you hear they may be cutting our health care at the company
8785217 i called on monday requesting a statement from the aclu about accountable americas intimidation campaign against gop donors
8785218 michelle my apologies that i cannot be of more assistance but we dont have anyone available thanks pam
8785219 pam does this mean you dont have anyone available today this week or for the foreseeable future
8785220 us vs our tendency to be petty and not listen to each other
8785221 protecting the 2nd amendment doesnt mean having ak 47s in the hands of criminals
8785222 answering attackers when the night is entirely focused on you both accepts the premise of their attacks and gives them free air time
8785223 helps dry up acne pimples rinse away blackheads amp shrink enlarged pores
8785224 helps dry up acne pimples rinse away blackheads and shrink enlarged pores
8785225 new frontier convention acceptance speech at the los angles coliseum in 1960 a risky decision given the 100 000 seat capacity
8785226 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8785227 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8785228 on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
8785229 we cannot walk alone and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8785230 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8785231 liberal has become a dirty word just as the electorate turned thumbs down on al gore and john kerry and mike dukakis
8785232 it was something we wanted to go and witness having no idea it would become what it has become but just wanted to go
8785233 what really hit you is that all those people it was very quiet it was almost an eerie feeling everybody had a purpose for being there
8785234 once he got into it you started really listening it just stuck with me all these years
8785235 a beginning of the fulfilment of that dream i mean its just starting when people are really judged on the content of their character not the color of their skin and hopefully this is a beginning for this country
8785236 am 4 november m ssen wir aufstehen und sagen acht sind genug
8785237 amerika wir sind besser als diese vergangenen acht jahre wir lieben dieses land zu sehr als dass die kommenden vier jahre aussehen wie die vergangenen acht
8785238 wir messen die st rke unserer wirtschaft nicht an der zahl der milliard re die wir haben

8785241 tidak bisa otomatis dibebaskan bisa jadi dalam proses pembuktian betul itu baru keterangan seseorang walaupun ada bukti lain tes dna itu semua harus melalui pembuktian
8785242 itu pintu darurat menteri kehakiman dan ketua ma dulu ke dpr buat pintu itu kemudian diintroduksi lagi dalam kuhap dan dicabut perma itu
8785243 itu risiko hukum kalau dulu dalam perma jaksa agung bisa ajukan pk tapi sekarang dalam kuhap tidak lagi
8785244 kita tidak hanya memberikan dukungan di bidang komunikasi politik tapi juga dalam bidang networking media champaign dan grassroot champaign
8785245 popularitas sb di tingkat nasional yang awalnya hanya 13 persen setelah 4 5 bulan ditangani fox indonesia melonjak menjadi 37 persen
8785246 we have been ordered by the prime minister not to break up the crowd tonight he is concerned about their safety and he wants us to continue to talk to them
8785247 you have to clear out or the police will clear you out
8785248 the prime minister has no objective to break up any rally
8785249 what we know for sure is that if any violence occurs it will come only from the government side not ours
8785250 that would require a state of emergency and i dont think the prime minister will do that it would make the country look bad
8785251 tergantung dari bobot yang bersangkutan itu seperti apa yang diperlukan untuk menggali hal tersebut apakah benar terjadi
8785252 sudah kami pikirkan itu nanti sudah dijelaskan pak dirut dirut sriwijaya air chandra lie akan menjadi tanggungan kami
8785253 mungkin akan berupa tanggungan akan mendapatkan deposito dan semacamnya tadi malam saya baru lihat di tv pak dirut ketemu korban di sana
8785254 kita ambil gambar dulu lalu kita diskusikan di jakarta ini bukan pekerjaan sehari
8785255 bureaucratic ideology of near stalinist zeal with corruption of the worst kind
8785256 we the people in order to form a more perfect union
8785257 we the government in order to establish a more perfect union
8785258 in accordance with what my conscience tells me to be the national interest and without regard to outside religious pressures or dictates and no power or threat of punishment could cause me to decide otherwise
8785259 there may be a legitimate diversity of opinion even among catholics about waging war and applying the death penalty but not however with regard to abortion and euthanasia
8785260 if a person who has been admonished persists in public mortal sin and attempts to receive communion the minister of the eucharist has the obligation to deny it to him why above all for the salvation of that person preventing him from committing a sacrilege
8785261 perhaps we should expect the democrat nominee to show up on the campaign trail wearing tights and a red white and blue cape
8785262 by closing its doors without any warning to employees this company acted irresponsibly as a state we are taking every action we can to help protect the rights of cct workers
8785263 the board of customized structures have a moral ethical and legal obligation under the law yet they continue to shrink from their responsibilities new hampshire is committed to helping these workers their families and the community through this difficult time and we will work to get the workers everything they are entitled to under the law
8785264 back in the neighborhood where the crime was perpetrated and where the victim and her family continue to live
8785265 this is clearly an injustice against the victim the victims family and all afghan women
8785266 such injustice can only promote a culture of impunity for violence perpetrated against women
8785267 on the basis of the physical damage to the aircrafts forward cargo hold and cabin it is evident that the number 4 passenger oxygen cylinder sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurized contents
8785268 the preliminary report was a factual account of the incident and investigation to date
8785269 ask s for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8785270 for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family

8785326 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream

8785340 the last fight with valuev was really one of my easiest fights
8785341 theres nothing he did that makes me feel i cant do anything i want with him and do it even better this time before i would try to go in with one or two punches and then get out but now im going stay in there and throw more and i know theyll connect
8785342 the way i see it don king has a freak show going with this guy if he were a normal sized fighter no one would be talking about him
8785343 this time im going for a knockout theres no way im leaving it to the judges but if it goes the distance im going to get a knockdown in each round as an exclamation point
8785344 when i take that walk to the ring to fight oscar i will carry all the people of the philippines the entire country on my shoulders i promise i will fight with all of my heart and that i will give everything i have

8785347 i would be shocked if hes not there a week from sunday
8785348 he would have to have a dramatic setback right now every step weve taken has been good
8785349 he wanted to see how loose hed be after the wait in the locker room that type of thing
8785350 we had an exercise bike out there for him but i think hes pretty happy with how the routine went
8785351 we had a good performance last week one and done this week
8785352 hes just got a bruise he really could have finished
8785353 were disappointed that we couldnt get the ball in the end zone but sometimes when you play a preseason opponent in the regular season youre going to be selective about what youre doing as they were
8785354 i have not heard from the packers since before the draft
8785355 my ears are definitely opened to listen if they need a proven backup for aaron

8785357 im going to say it for about the 100th time it takes time ok
8785358 it takes time to develop young quarterbacks and thats where we are im excited about their future but weve got work to do

8785360 this place really got loud i dont know if it was the loudest ive heard it but let me tell you what it was loud
8785361 i mean ive been able to do that since i was in the minor leagues
8785362 ive always been able to drive in runs its something im proud of and i like to be in that situation late in the game
8785363 fontenot hit a homer and all of a sudden its a two run game and we got the top of our lineup coming soriano got on base and theriot got on base we got a good team
8785364 we shouldnt be going through this this is our time to hold these leads and its our job were not getting it done right now
8785365 yeah to think about how well cole threw the ball and how well our guys put at bats up against dempster its a tough one
8785366 that was a situation where we couldnt get people out actually the last game and most of the last games that weve lost thats kind of how its been
8785367 we have a lot of tough decisions ahead of us with the back end of the roster so i wanted to give those guys an opportunity and you cant do that without giving them reps
8785368 i think they drafted me for a reason ill go watch film and wait
8785369 now well go back evaluate the film and make cuts but there are some guys here that really showed well for themselves and guys that didnt
8785370 i think i have progressed every game throughout the preseason that was my goal if i can continue to do that then hopefully ill have a great career here
8785371 before the tournament i was not imagining it this way like it happened today a giddy coin said after beating ana ivanovic 6 3 4 6 6 3 thursday in the second round of the u s open
8785372 so i guess maybe now im going to think about like keep playing she said
8785373 i thought she was maybe nervous more than i was coin said
8785374 when we get to clemson theyre like ok you dont like usc she said
8785375 why because thats like this you dont like the chicken whatever so thats how they teach us and then you start liking football too
8785376 the important thing was i had to come back in the third set and im happy with the victory
8785377 now im in the third round im happy for me its a very important tournament here
8785378 i have a tough opponent troicki he is a good server
8785379 i mean of course you would get friction going from a moving object to the catwalk but other than that it was fine
8785380 nervous he actually had fun he was in milan to do catwalk so sydney was just like fine

8785498 helena provides a great counterbalance to some of glenns wackiness
8785499 we filed 19 companies 18 of them operated restaurants one restaurant closed pre filing then we closed the one in west palm beach
8785500 we have got to this position relatively quickly through the media attention we have had through our prices and through word of mouth
8785501 we have the biggest range of health and beauty products online in excess of 20 000 products mr soma said the success of the website had been boosted by the economic downturn and the fact that people were now looking to cheaper products

8785508 the commander in chief and those under him authorized a systematic regime of torture the only question that remains to be answered is whether those who ordered the use of torture will be held to account
8785509 the ranking members of the senate and house intelligence committees were briefed dozens of times about the cias interrogation and detention program over the past seven years so any member who has held one of those posts including speaker pelosi would find it very hard at this point to point the finger at the white house without also implicating themselves

8785511 its not even really a metaphor for slavery slavery is whats going on
8785512 i would truthfully say that angola prison is a sophisticated plantation
8785513 cotton is king still applies when it come to angola
8785514 allows inmates to be trained in work habits and allows them to develop marketable skills in the areas of farming animal husbandry vegetable meat and milk processing
8785515 the warden says it takes good food good medicine good prayin and good playin to have a good prison
8785516 in the conventional plantations slaves were given just enough food clothing and shelter to be a financial asset to the owner the same is true for the louisiana prison system
8785517 prisoners worked out in the field sometimes 17 hours straight rain or shine
8785518 theyd tell you the officer was always right no matter what
8785519 neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime where of the party shall have been duly convicted shall exist within the united states
8785520 prisoners can be forced to work for the government against their will and this is true in every state
8785521 i would have more faith in that amendment if it werent so clear that our criminal justice system is racially biased in a really obvious way
8785522 i dont have any illusions that this is a simple process
8785523 many people are apathetic about what happens in prisons it would be very difficult but i would not suggest it would be impossible
8785524 many black inmates viewed farm work under these circumstances as too close to slavery to want to participate
8785525 theyve got a lot of land to bury a lot of prisoners

8785535 this is one of my favourite pics i took in india this was taken at a village when we visited a suicide farmers family and these were some of the children from the village dashing to our bus to bid us goodbye with earnest eyes and outstretched arms i took this shot from my van and even as the vehicle drove away we could see the boys chasing after us and this shot probably highlights one of the many facets i found out about india that even if everything else fails one thing still stands the pure earnest intentions of the people in the villages be it a widow who just lost her husband be it a brother who has to shoulder the huge debt left behind by a loved one whether it is a child who just lost his father a girl who is just around the corner whatever difficulties they may face many of them still have a heart big enough to put many of us to shame every crease and wrinkle across their forehead tells a story every line across their face like the map of their lives prior to this gofar experience i could never really understand or even fathom the depths of poverty these people face reading it from a newspaper or a magazine is just simply different from speaking to them personally and looking at their lands their farms and their homes and without a doubt what i had uncover and witnessed is just the tip of the iceberg but enough to make me ponder about certain life issues and to look back at this picture just brings back memories of their culture and the people in the villages with all the glitz and glamour of emerging india claiming the limelight this may well be one of their best kept secrets

8785543 these people suffered a brutal attack at chevrons command and have worked for nine years to have their day in court
8785544 now that the court has granted them a trial it is disturbing to think that the u s consulate might be playing politics with their visas
8785545 but now that the trial is going forward women and children whose husbands and fathers were tortured and killed and individuals who witnessed the killings are being blocked

8785551 the suspicion would arise that someone in the united states created this conflict on purpose to stir up the situation and to create an advantage for one of the candidates in the competitive race for the presidency in the united states
8785552 even during the cold war during the time of tough confrontation between the soviet union and the united states we have always avoided direct clashes between our civilians let alone our servicemen
8785553 we have serious reasons to believe that directly in the combat zone citizens of the united states were present
8785554 that united states citizens were present in the combat zone that means only one thing that they could be there only on the direct instruction of their leadership and if this is so then it means that american citizens are in the combat zone performing their duties and they can only do that following a direct order from their leader and not on their own initiative
8785555 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8785556 it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8785557 what was the gentlemans purpose of being among the special forces and what he is doing today i so far cannot answer
8785558 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8785559 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one of the sides and push it into the murder of the other side and its over it seemed like an easy solution the thing is it turns out that its not always so

8785609 john mccain ha votado con george bush el 90 por ciento de las veces al senador mccain le gusta hablar de tener criterio pero realmente qu criterio tienes si piensas que george bush ha estado en lo cierto en el 90 por ciento de las veces
8785610 no s ustedes pero yo no estoy dispuesto a apostar que la posibilidad de cambio sea del 10 por ciento
8785611 no creo que al senador mccain no le importe la vida de los estadounidenses realmente lo que creo es que no sabe lo que les pasa c mo se puede explicar que defina la clase media como la familia que ingresa m s de cinco millones de d lares al a o
8785612 la creencia de que podemos lograr todo lo que nos propongamos es lo que ha caracterizado a este pa s pero ahora esta creencia est en peligro porque estamos en un momento en que estamos en guerra nuestra econom a est agitada y el sue o americano est de nuevo bajo amenaza
8785613 el gobierno no ha sido el causante de todos estos problemas pero el fracaso en afrontarlos s es culpa del gobierno fallido de george w bush y de la pol tica quebrantada que se hace en washington

8785621 in malaysian politics you have the both the bn and opposition parties controlling 30 of the hardcore base vote and the 40 in the middle will determine victory and in permatang pauh he anwar solidly captured 70
8785622 there were two things that turned off voters in the recent by elections one was the sodomy allegations and the other was the playing up of racial sentiments the twin attacks on anwar did not hold water they actually backfired
8785623 with regards to why anwar gained chinese support despite a bn candidate fluent in chinese the chinese saw the message over the candidate bn tried to play a divide and rule game by portraying datuk arif shah omar shah as a pro chinese candidate on one hand while attacking anwar as a malay traitor
8785624 so no matter how proficient arif shah was at hokkien or mandarin it would not have helped
8785625 anwar has been consistent in his message for change to free the country from racial politics and corruption and that message has gone down well across communities the key factor was that people were frustrated with the status quo with bn politics and just wanted a change
8785626 no one believes in bn like they did before and there is a lack of trust in bn leaders umno has remained in a state of denial since march 8
8785627 the people are becoming more and more politically informed thanks to the alternative media they are insulting the intellectual voters by trying to use the media to play up their stories the bn governments thinking gap is far from the peoples their campaign strategy is a failure it is too out dated and it is just not working
8785628 the people want something but the bn gives a different thing those who believed that the bn government would do something to change their lives are probab y upset
8785629 the ruling party could not answer or respond to all the questions put forth by opposition leaders anwars promise of a new hope for malaysia has somehow convinced many even some strong bn supporters
8785630 bn has also lost the confidence of the malays and non malays especially among the middle class group it failed to understand the peoples grievances and that is how they become silent voters
8785631 i am not denying that the bn government has contributed a lot in the past but the present leadership has failed to address the rakyats grievances
8785632 it needs to rebuild the confidence of the people in bn and its image stop all personal attacks on the opposition and show more transparency
8785633 what is in question right now is the credibility of the bn led government for tabling the dna identification bill for second reading without any proper consultation with experts of the subject
8785634 everyone except the bn members is questioning the bill the bill can only be agreed upon in the context of malevolent politics and differed by all the experts out there
8785635 this malicious bill is apparently targeted towards a certain person and that targeted person is now in the house with us today
8785636 there is an apparent sign of lack of confidence in government institutions which have failed to lead by example and when this happens will events like the blockade of the website malaysia today occur or will we see a major crackdown on other internet news portal as well
8785637 because we found that some of the comments on the website were insensitive bordering on incitement
8785638 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
8785639 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia
8785640 we must not be part of the redrawing of lines in europe
8785641 we support georgias territorial integrity that means that the leaders of the abkhaz and south ossetians are not on the same legal grounds as the democratically elected leaders of georgia or the leader of russia
8785642 war propagandists for hire croatia bosnia use western public relations firms to win support
8785643 a positive croatian image to members of congress administration officials and the news media
8785644 that was quite a change from the previous year when the emphasis was on the integrity of the borders getting former secretary of state lawrence eagleburger to name names and talk of war crimes trials was obviously a breakthrough
8785645 back then the croats took an incredibly brutal action and killed many civilians but the west pretended they did not see it actually the u s helped plan and equip the genocidal operation now the georgians have done the same while using the heavy artillery and grad missile systems
8785646 the difference is that then president slobodan milosevic did nothing to help serbs in croatia while the russian authorities ordered their army to enter south ossetia
8785647 south ossetians began seeking more sovereignty in 1989 for their autonomous republic in north central georgia but the georgian parliament abolished south ossetias autonomous status
8785648 the kosovo precedent has driven us to more actively seek our rights
8785649 if they recognized kosovo they would be setting a precedent for south ossetia and other breakaway provinces
8785650 bush administration officials in turn stated that kosovo was a unique case
8785651 apparently believing that they could define what kosovos independence meant to others
8785652 if the us opts not to respect the principle of sovereignty it encourages other powers to do the same thus undermining state sovereignty the world over
8785653 bajram rexhepi a so called mayor of kosovska mitrovica said that albanians will self organize and put serbs in the city under the control if unmik will not do that
8785654 a reversion to not just cold war politics it is a 19 century way of doing politics
8785655 i think its very clear that russian ambitions are to restore the old russian empire not the soviet union but the russian empire
8785656 its a reversion to not just post colonial politics it is a seventh century way of doing politics
8785657 the return of russia portends a shift in the balance of political forces in the middle east that for the moment at least appears to weaken the american and pro western side of the balance and to strengthen the iranian side
8785658 all arabs are mad at georgia because it sent its troops to iraq and took part in the occupation of that arab land
8785659 if it werent for russia georgian forces would still be in iraq
8785660 i hope russia companies will take part in the bidding
8785661 lukoil is welcome to bid for the service contract at the second or third stage of the tender in march or september
8785662 did someone within the u s suggest that iraq reach out to russia as a show of good will or did russia want to show that they are indispensable in the middle east that they are a player
8785663 the only danger is if there are deals to sell of some of that infrastructure to russia power plants and such
8785664 that would come with greater political influence which would not fit in with our policies in the middle east
8785665 washington needs russia too much on big issues like iran to risk it all to defend georgia
8785666 growing feeling among some officials in the bush administration that perhaps the united states cannot have it all and may have to choose its priorities
8785667 if someone went to the russians and said ok kosovo for iran wed have a deal
8785668 the commander in chief and those under him authorized a systematic regime of torture the only question that remains to be answered is whether those who ordered the use of torture will be held to account
8785669 the ranking members of the senate and house intelligence committees were briefed dozens of times about the cias interrogation and detention program over the past seven years so any member who has held one of those posts including speaker pelosi would find it very hard at this point to point the finger at the white house without also implicating themselves

8785672 generally most jewellery companies have a counter or two for diamonds while gold jewellery occupies 80 of the counter space we believe that from mine to market gold and diamonds are handled very differently it is only at the retail end that the two were merged till now c krishniah chetty amp sons decided to separate the gold jewellery and diamond jewellery into two full showrooms
8785673 in india c krishniah chetty amp sons are the first signature designers who have created exclusive verticals for its gold and diamond business fronts to offer specialization greater depth and a focused customer interface this is likely to foster growth and change the face of the industry and is a path breaking effort in creating two specialist businesses
8785674 here they are covering the process of selecting the president and nobody is covering the actual president
8785675 we are in the process of reevaluating our relationship with russia
8785676 what if they gave a cold war and nobody came
8785677 he went to new orleans and gulfport miss barely got covered
8785678 you have to know what you can say and what you cant say
8785679 you dont get enough information to write something its never enough
8785680 even during the cold war during the harsh confrontation between the soviet union and the united states we always avoided direct clashes between our civilians even more so between our military personnel
8785681 ordinary experts even if they teach military affairs should not do so in combat zones but in training areas and training centers
8785682 what was the purpose of that gentleman being among the special forces and what is he doing today i so far cannot answer
8785683 i wish we had americans and american weapons but its not the case
8785684 they are living in a parallel world with a parallel perception if you say a lie in russia it becomes the truth the next day on tv
8785685 we did not kill up to 90 civilians as has been alleged
8785686 ive seen the account stated from both the u n and certainly from the afghan government ive also seen it discussed that in fact that didnt happen
8785687 we know that when collateral damage occurs that it really does set us back so we work exceptionally hard to make sure that doesnt happen
8785688 were looking to do that as rapidly as we can
8785689 catholic ministers may licitly administer the sacraments of penance eucharist and anointing of the sick to members of the oriental churches which do not have full communion with the catholic church if they ask on their own for the sacraments and are properly disposed this holds also for members of other churches which in the judgment of the apostolic see are in the same condition as the oriental churches as far as these sacraments are concerned
8785690 if the danger of death is present or other grave necessity in the judgment of the diocesan bishop or the conference of bishops catholic ministers may licitly administer these sacraments to other christians who do not have full communion with the catholic church who cannot approach a minister of their own community and on their own ask for it provided they manifest catholic faith in these sacraments and are properly disposed
8785691 in the present state of our relations with the ecclesial communities of the reformation of the 16th century we have not yet reached agreement about the significance or sacramental nature or even of the administration of the sacrament of confirmation therefore under present circumstances persons entering into full communion with the catholic church from one of these communities are to receive the sacrament of confirmation according to the doctrine and rite of the catholic church before being admitted to eucharistic communion
8785692 manifested catholic faith in these sacraments and was properly disposed
8785693 baptism which constitutes the sacramental bond of unity existing among all who through it are reborn is wholly directed toward the acquiring of fullness of life in christ
8785694 there will be heavy sledding for the u s economy during the next couple of quarters
8785695 whats the best way to get from here to there
8785696 well we know that barrack hussein obama will sacrifice the imminent victory and will cut run and retreated to the iraqi muslim terrorists
8785697 mccain is preparing to smear him with lack of patriotism effete and being out of touch with common people
8785698 what we saw yesterday was a huge victory for the community and the workers in the electricity industry in nsw
8785699 many of these workers are women in rural nsw and the government needs to answer on what is going to happen to those jobs
8785700 this is an option that they brought to us last year and continued to bring to us in the early part of this year
8785701 we are still leaving there those protections for workers that are in the retail area
8785702 in may there was a move to change the platform and there was strong legal advice that the motion moved to change the platform was not valid
8785703 now if the party office and party officers are going to test this alternative against the platform i would welcome that
8785704 that is why morris iemma cant be believed on anything he says on power because on each and every one of those occasions he has misled the public he said
8785705 he has in the words of the minister for health yesterday lied lied lied and lied again and mr speaker he is continuing now to do so
8785706 the sovereign risk agreement has a deadline and the governments given that deadline to be the 30th of november i think and thats where we stand as a government the line has been drawn
8785707 we have mostly a stable and predictable taxation system and regulatory system
8785708 if governments are going to come along and out of the blue pull taxes on like this you will have a riskier environment for companies to operate and they will make decisions about australia based on that
8785709 gas is a pretty reasonable solution to carbon emissions from other generating sources and i would have thought a government from any persuasion would be keen to encourage gas production rather than impose new taxes on them
8785710 your cell phone babbling is annoying those around with the inanity of your petty problems have a nice day
8785711 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland

8785715 what is needed from the devolved administration at stormont is a set of policies to take account of the different population profiles in the catholic and protestant communities to answer their different needs and stop following the outdated nio mindset of trying to pretend that everything here would be ok if everyone started behaving as if they lived in england
8785716 in january five north belfast protestant clergy wrote to the unionist oriented news letter complaining of the failure of the executive to tackle sectarianism they wrote we have poor inter community relationships effective apartheid in housing across our villages towns and cities community division exemplified in but not confined to the physical structures of peace walls slow pace of reconciliation sectarianism and fractured educational provision our real angst is that a suggested programme for government almost totally fails to acknowledge these profoundly difficult issues exist the response from the dup junior minister in ofmdfm mr donaldson was that power sharing was the shared interpretation which seemed to confuse politics as means with the ends it aimed to realise the draft programme for government had significantly replaced the language of a shared future with a better future inline with its prioritisation of the economy a much more convivial focus for members of the political class than the challenge of tackling the communal divisions in which they were so deeply implicated the revised pfg32 published by messrs paisley and mcguinness introduced the clumsy circumlocution of a shared and better future
8785717 is a matter the government has to consider in due course but we are not at that point in our discussions at all yet the point of discussion we are at at the moment is examining the outcome of the referendum and obviously there will be a lot meetings with eu colleagues between now and the end of the year where it will be discussed further with them so its not just a matter for our own personal consideration or national consideration it is a matter we have to discuss with colleagues as well
8785718 in every society there is a substantial gap between the life expectancy of the children of the most affluent and privileged and those who are born into deprivation but some countries are better than others at closing the gap
8785719 a boy in the suburb of calton glasgow can expect to live 28 years less than one raised in lenzie a few miles away one born in hampstead london will live around 11 years longer than a boy from st pancras five stops away on the northern line of the underground
8785720 even in these times when all the talk is of putting history behind us the easiest way to tell the difference between the irish and the english is to utter the word
8785721 i was myself assaulted and received death threats the depth of hatred that still exists in ireland is matched only by unawareness in non catholic english circles of what cromwell did in ireland i am reminded of gk chestertons remark that the tragedy of the english conquest of ireland in the 17th century is that the irish can never forget it and the english can never remember it
8785722 it was in accordance with the laws of war but it went far beyond what any general had done in england
8785723 this was ethnic cleansing on a scale undreamt of by slobodan milosevic
8785724 reverence for cromwell was one of the few socialist traditions that survived the transition from old to new labour
8785725 he was on the right side in the civil war and because of him the right side won he changed the course of english history and changed it for the better
8785726 until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved
8785727 it is increasingly a manifestation of republican frustration at the failure of sinn f in to deliver what it promised to its own movement
8785728 nationalists and republicans will once again be disappointed by the attitude being displayed by the sdlp
8785729 any commitments that were given by the government to sinn f in are a matter for the government but the dup made the situation perfectly clear before we left st andrews that we had not agreed to any dates for the transfer of powers
8785730 i say again that until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved it should not be taking on more especially a portfolio as contentious as justice
8785731 i was outside the family home when the raid began and i was inside immediately afterwards speaking with the family who are close friends of mine the reality of the ruc psni was here for all to see in broad daylight and the residents of this estate remain justifiably suspicious of the force
8785732 most accounts agree that it was south ossetian separatists who committed the first act of escalation when they blew up a georgian military vehicle on august 1 wounding five georgian peacekeeping troops georgia responded in kind killing six south ossetian militiamen
8785733 capt ivanov and eduard kokoity the pro moscow president of south ossetia say they held a meeting that day between marat kulakhmetov commander of the russian peacekeeping forces and temur yakobashvili the georgian minister for re integration whose job is to deal with the breakaway regions
8785734 i would like to address those who are now shooting at georgian policemen i want to say with full responsibility that several hours ago i reached a very difficult decision not to respond with fire this was no use however and the fighting escalated
8785735 georgian president sakashvilis biggest lie was his attempt to airbrush the fact that he created the crisis by launching an artillery barrage on the south ossetian capital which killed scores of civilians and 15 russian peacekeepers it was absurd to think russia would not retaliate so the next lie was to claim russias leaders had prepared a trap in fact they were taken by surprise as much as the ossetians nevertheless russia should pull back completely now it should also have restrained south ossetian militias from running amok against georgian villages
8785736 eyesight of thousands to be saved after nice approves drug
8785737 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london
8785738 clintons deputy national policy director jake sullivan outlined several irish policies that would be undertaken in a clinton white house come 2009 he said clinton would immediately appoint an american special envoy on ireland who would maintain an office in the white house and report directly to the president clinton would also firmly focus on economic development in northern ireland sullivan said and have her secretary of commerce and other government agencies get involved in developing strategies for ireland
8785739 in the observer alan ruddock begins his account with the morning of september 11 the day of the terrorist attack on the world trade centre in new york as the us special envoy to ireland richard haas was preparing for a meeting with sinn fein leader gerry adams
8785740 after a few minutes of talking about inching forward towards the peace process haas finally snapped
8785741 yet there were indications that no 10 had more room for manoeuvre than it realised in july 2005 the ira had finally agreed to decommission all its weapons at the last minute adams called no 10 to demand that some of the weapons not be destroyed so that the ira could arm itself against possible attacks from dissident members unless this was allowed he threatened decommissioning would not proceed the blair government conceded but wanted to check with dublin irish justice minister michael mcdowell refused to acquiesce in the backsliding despite enormous pressure powell told adams of the problem and adams gave way decommissioning took place as planned
8785742 anyone who omits one step in that sequence of values is falsifying the situation
8785743 605 000 long term immigrants arriving in the year to mid 2007 the eu projections show that the wave of migration to britain boosting both the workforce and fertility rates is out of step with many other european countries where deaths are expected to overtake births after 2015
8785744 trends differ for the four countries of the uk the population of england is projected to increase by 8 per cent by 2016 that of northern ireland by 7 per cent big year that and wales by 5 per cent the projected increase for scotland where fertility and life expectancy levels are assumed to remain lower than in the rest of the uk is 3 per cent across the united kingdom northern ireland recorded the highest rate of growth with a one per cent population rise last year to 1 8 million people the population of england rose by 0 6 per cent to 51 1 million scotland and wales rose by 0 5 per cent

8785749 this is not a game this is not fun what weve seen tonight is actually attempted murder please stop it now before someone is killed
8785750 discussions on the devolution of policing and justice have progressed well in the preparation for government committee the governments have requested the parties to continue these discussions so as to agree the necessary administrative arrangements to create a new policing and justice department it is our view i e the view of the two governments that the implementation of the agreement published today should be sufficient to build the community confidence necessary for the assembly to request the devolution of criminal justice and policing from the british government by may 2008
8785751 there is no definitive date for the devolution of policing and justice powers we remain of the unshakable view that those powers can only be transferred whenever there is the required community confidence

8785761 australians are spending a record percentage of their income just to pay the interest component of their mortgages
8785762 it never ceases to amaze me that some people actuallhy believe that national governments run national economies
8785763 that means hes the best because hes got lots of money

8785772 i really think he senses that he can be a significant benefit to the team by not playing this week and by playing a lot fitter a lot healthier in the first week of the finals
8785773 if hes got his perth glory hat on and getting us in the top four thats our goal and hopefully with his signature it will send the message out to a lot of people that perth are back on the map
8785774 since i came to australia ive been coming and watching and supporting glory and now playing for them
8785775 i am not saying i should be told as president but i would certainly like my ceo to be told

8785805 ele rebateu ponto a ponto tudo o que os republicanos j usaram contra ele como a acusa o de ser uma celebridade e a de ser inexperiente e mesmo o que poderiam usar ao buscar um discurso mais voltado para o centro nos grandes temas sociais do pa s
8785806 em nove anos de conven es nunca vi o partido democrata bater de frente com tanta nfase

8785824 n o acho que o senador mccain queira ironizar sobre o que acontece na vida dos americanos penso simplesmente que ele n o faz id ia sen o porque definiria a classe m dia como os que ganham menos de us 5 milh es por ano
8785825 n o que john mccain queira ironizar ele simplesmente n o entende
8785826 embora a petrobras que sujeita s regras de mercado seja relativamente enxuta qualquer nova companhia estatal poder rapidamente ficar inchada por indica es pol ticas

8785832 we want to stay married for life until were dead

8785835 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8785836 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8785837 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8785838 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8785839 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8785840 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8785841 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8785842 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8785843 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8785844 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8785845 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8785846 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8785847 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8785848 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8785849 while the directors believe it is probable that the mill project will proceed to completion the financing structure is yet to be finalised
8785850 and gunns cannot state with certainty that such a structure will be achievable nor can it provide an assurance that the mill project will proceed
8785851 discussions with potential debt providers are at various stages certain debt providers have indicated agreement in principle to facility terms with other debt providers discussions are ongoing
8785852 in addition gunns is continuing its discussions with a number of potential equity parties including industry participants who have expressed interest in making a direct equity investment in the mill project
8785853 it is gunns current intention that a joint venture equity partner will be invited to take up to a 50 per cent interest in the mill project however whether this eventuates will depend on the outcome of negotiations
8785854 the process with potential equity parties will take a period of time to work through and gunns does not expect the financing plan to be finalised before the first quarter of 2009 with principal construction activities unlikely to commence before then
8785855 there is a huge amount of uncertainty as to why there are big natural swings in co2 levels
8785856 its clear from our work that the greenland ice sheet is very sensitive to carbon dioxide levels but its wrong to draw inferences about what will happen
8785857 you cant say that if you get to the level of 400 ppm the ice sheet will melt in the next hundred years because we dont know enough about the process it might be easier to create an icesheet than to melt if you reverse what you did before you dont necessarily get the same answer back
8785858 yup but they might just save your goddamn ass someday

8785863 increased costs are having a significant impact on most industries in europe and our industry is no exception we continue to monitor the business environment in the sectors in which we operate we are working proactively with our suppliers and we are taking action to keep costs to a minimum however given the speed and scale of these rises it is necessary to increase prices for the commercial packaging and industrial markets
8785864 we are committed to offering our customers world class products and the highest level of service through quality service and innovation and these price increases are essential in order for us achieve this we will continue to provide proactive support and advice to our customers especially during this challenging period
8785865 season ticket sales have continued to climb the last couple of years

8785869 the real reason for not committing suicide is because you always know how swell life gets again after the hell is over

8785873 these bowl shaped depressions reflect the former location of relatively pure glacier ice
8785874 this late stage snow could accumulate in depressions on the crater wall and in favorable microclimate settings melt to produce the observed gullies and fans
8785875 are exciting because they establish a spatial link between recent gullies and accumulation of glacier ice strengthening the case for surface melt water flow in the formation of gullies on mars

8785879 its the light not the darkness that most frightens us
8785880 it hasnt changed my driving at all not a bit i just have to work harder
8785881 we do see reports of a significant change in the types of cars people are buying but ive been mostly surprised at the lack of a reaction
8785882 one had hoped that these prices would deter driving but people have coped better than we hoped they would
8785883 we believe that co2 from personal transport has to be decreased in a holistic way with contributions from all sectors no one thing will bring levels down
8785884 everyone puts all the pressure on the manufacturers and were doing our part
8785885 but others should do their part as well nothing much has been done with driving improving infrastructure
8785886 price appears to be a highly effective way of influencing behavior
8785887 price alone doesnt win popular support or acquiescence there has to be a package of a variety of different policies including improvements to public transport walking and cycling
8785888 the most recent ice retreat reflects melting in the chukchi sea off the alaskan coast and the east siberian seas off the coast of eastern russia
8785889 envisat observations from mid august depict that a new record of low sea ice coverage could be reached in a matter of weeks
8785890 polarstern will circumnavigate the whole arctic ocean and exit through the northeast passage
8785891 the polar regions especially the arctic are very sensitive indicators of climate change
8785892 the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change has shown that these regions are highly vulnerable to rising temperatures and predicted that the arctic would be virtually ice free in the summer months by 2070
8785893 other scientists claim it could become ice free as early as 2040
8785894 latest satellite observations suggest that the arctic could be mainly ice free even earlier
8785895 our study suggests that if sea ice continues to contract rapidly over the next several years arctic land warming and permafrost thaw are likely to accelerate
8785896 the loss of sea ice can trigger widespread changes that would be felt across the region
8785897 evidence shows that around three million years ago there was an increase in the amount of rock and debris deposited on the ocean floor around greenland
8785898 these rocks could not have got there until icebergs started to form and could transport them indicating that large amounts of ice on greenland only began to form about three million years ago
8785899 prior to that greenland was largely ice free and probably covered in grass and forest furthermore atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were relatively high so the question we wanted to answer was why did greenland become covered in an ice sheet

8786018 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons

8786058 im a gay man and so refer mrs ephron to one and when shes done making herself familiar with mcclurkin id like to point her toward you see there are other things that are important to me this isnt a one issue election and i have a very big problem voting for a candidate that uses anti gay bigots as part of their campaign regardless of the threat mccain may pose to
8786059 during the campaign you never heard bill clinton say about obama that he would have to think about supporting him and that his support would depend on his tone but you never heard hillary say that she would get baracks supporters but that she couldnt guarantee that he would get hers but frankly i dont think she owes barack another second of her time but guess what shell give it and gladly shes a better person than i am thats why i wanted to see her as president

8786119 so i have a solution to the health care crisis and it will cost not one thin dime
8786120 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care so there you have it voila problem solved
8786121 so instead of producing worthless statistics that people fling around in vacuous editorials and pointless debates the census bureau should produce meaningful numbers identifying all of the sources of funds people will draw on if they need medical care

8786123 we cannot have an education revolution and give every australian child a world education if they are not going to school we will not be able to improve literacy and numeracy and improve the year 12 retention rate if kids arent turning up to classes

8786125 where is the evidence base that this punitive approach will actually work income management is a very blunt and ineffective tool to address the complex problem of children who are being failed by our education system and do not want to be at school
8786126 the rudd government needs to be looking at the social economic and educational problems that contribute to truancy problems rather than rely on penalizing measures such as welfare quarantining and suspension the real factors behind poor school attendance are the failures of the education system in some regions to deliver appropriate early childhood and primary education and provide educational and social support services for disadvantaged families
8786127 they have tried threatening they have tried jailing and instead of getting better the situation is getting worse the time has come to turn the policy on its head and look at why children are truanting

8786135 for many centuries unmanly men in the northern lands of europe have made sacrifices to muttere prayers to incanted spells beseeching danced in ecstasy for seen visions from and adorned themselves as the goddesses of that region these are the goddesses who make the snow fly in the heart of winter who gather the souls of the dead and lead the spirits of the unborn on their midnight sojourns who teach the arts of seeing to humankind who weave the grisly sinews of fate somewhere the unmanly men got lost in the stories that have come down to us the fairy stories of how things used to be the storytellers no longer understood the tales of the men in skirts who seek visions or work strange forms of magic or speak with animals and the spirits of the woods or the dead they did not fathom the role these men had in the tales and so they changed the stories to make sense once again only without those men and then again many stories must surely have been forgotten because they no longer made sense without such men in them sometimes one sees glimmers such as the boy who cooks and tends house while his brothers go out to hunt in the forest he it is who coaxes secrets from his mother and befriends the sister they have sworn to slay he is the one whose arm remains in the shape of a swans wing harking back to a time when such transformations were the mark of such men as he and then there are the tales of masked boys dressed as beautiful and ugly perchtas and other masked figures wearing cowbells who beat each other with sticks at carnaval in order to bring abundance or even the tale of the little one who finds himself in a family of ducks until he discovers those graceful and powerful beings called swans finding as well that he is one of them
8786136 in the stories of the first of these unmanly men men called them cowcunts of sorcery bitches of prophecy not always well loved were they for some deemed them less than men and therefore contemptible among some peoples they were drowned in swamps and the was one eyvindr by name who was tied to a sea rock and overcome by the tide there was ragnvald rettlebone who was burnt or else drowned along with eighty more unloved they were feared because of their unmanly skirts their uncanny powers their unfettered lust they straddled the abyss between man and woman animal and human society and wilderness life and death safety and danger spirit and flesh blessing and curse murder was the only means of controlling these creatures of fixing their ebbs and their flows of making them safe she roams the outskirts of civilized places for those who have created these places do not know her do not understand her and there is no place for her within walls of the known world the walls bar one from being whole women are like such and such men like so and so but she is not one of their women and the men who follow her are not their men even aftr all this time these fey men remember that she is the mistress of some other realm a realm where they have a place

8786192 females can also get hiv quicker than males because of their anatomy theyre receivers
8786193 women can empower themselves to protect themselves but more importantly we need to think of the importance of monogamous relationships understanding what true love caring and being faithful are all about
8786194 i have to be totally honest with you because if i dont i will be upset when i leave here that i didnt say anything what happened he again said something about him leaving the cost of goods out and i told him i knew that but why did it take a week to get my return back
8786195 people make mistakes and you owned up to it but if this was your money that you were waiting for you would want it you know our situation and how we are struggling it isnt right that you took a week to get this return to me if i were you i would have been in constant contact with my client to let them know what was going on you never returned my calls or my emails and that is not good business word of mouth is a huge compliment and you could have totally rectified this problem by handling it professionally so what happened why did it take a week to get this to me
8786196 i have no excuse i was planning for my ribbon cutting
8786197 he should have called me to tell me that he had something he was planning but that he would get to my return as soon as he was done i got the amounts to you on thursday and you had your ribbon cutting on tuesday name there was plenty of time to either do my return and get it right back to me or to let me know that you didnt forget me and would get it to me as soon as your ribbon cutting was done
8786198 the game was fine until the last series when we fumbled the ball before the half and then the first series of the second half
8786199 we kind of let the game get away from us we just ran out of gas on defense at the end a lot of the rest of our problems had to do with the ineptness of our offense
8786200 certainly we missed jamelle eugene but everybody was talking about andre brown like he was chopped liver
8786201 i thought we rushed the ball well all night andre had over 100 yards and curtis underwood got some yards at the end of the game
8786202 we held them for a while but we didnt hold them long enough
8786203 we still have some work to do this was a game to show what we had on defense we just need to get more effort from the whole team
8786204 you see a teammate that you practice with and lift weights down on the field like that and it is really hard to watch
8786205 but the hangover from that was not why we lost other than losing a great player i dont think there was an emotional hangover
8786206 we will go back home get them going and go out and win a football game next week against william amp mary

8786224 we had our first team meeting here at texas this week and i talked about the fact that there are so many things we will be able to implement
8786225 a couple of offensive sets some defensive strategies i learned a lot from our own team from team usa but also from opponents
8786226 the men and the women were so supportive of each other
8786227 they were at every one of our games we went to all of their games except we couldnt go to the gold medal game because we were on the way home you always knew when the men came in to the womens game because there was a roar from the crowd they were rock stars

8786231 i think it will be considerably louder in the stadium
8786232 but it probably protects the north neighborhood better from noise because the north end is higher than it was
8786233 i believe we kind of set the standard i dont feel like we are keeping up
8786234 one time we were playing golf and tom said if you were king for a day what would you do i said fix the stadium this is a 1920s and a 1930s facility then he became a regent and don evans became a regent with hicks evans and cunningham we had the leadership
8786235 we have plans to go to 115 000 but were not active on that at all
8786236 we ought to live where we are for a while to see how it works
8786237 if we keep the program where it is and i think we can and will people will come

8786251 im absolutely shocked i still cant believe it youre standing there as theyre reading out the names but you never think youre going to win
8786252 ive had a lot of fun doing it there is a lot of apprehension especially before the swimsuit round you just hope you dont fall over in these high heels
8786253 ive had a good rapport with all the girls of course you always think id love to win but once i met the other contestants there was just a good feeling between all of us i think we all deserved to win tonight
8786254 in particular my dad has pushed me all the way hes always seen me for me and ive really appreciated that he used to be an army man and i think thats always spurred me on to do well
8786255 ive not been spoilt but ive always been encouraged by my father he may have pushed me when i was 16 but i dont regret a single moment im so glad he did encourage me

8786268 the area saw very little coalition presence prior to 2007
8786269 now the populace is absolutely assured of coalition commitment and the commitment of iraqi security forces
8786270 coalition and iraqi security efforts combine to deny insurgent sanctuary and provide a solid foundation of hope for the free citizens of madain
8786271 the great news story of all of this is the iraqi governments increasing capacity to fund civil works reconstruction
8786272 their financial commitment in madain exceeds coalition forces by about a 60 to 40 ratio their plans clearly show their commitment to take over reconstruction funding and move beyond its reliance on u s funds
8786273 security trends continue to head in the right direction violence is down more than its been at any time in four plus years the political process continues
8786274 i would hope to be able to make recommendations for further troop reductions when those conditions are met
8786275 as far as the specifics of when we would get that done or how we would get that done we just havent arrived at that particular point
8786276 weve got that request and were looking for ways to answer that
8786277 thats where the need is right now specifically on the military side and so were working hard to provide as much of that as we can
8786278 part of what i did in my engagement when this crisis started was in speaking with my counterpart and i was very straightforward about the fact that we were going to bring the georgian troops back from iraq
8786279 i did that to make sure he knew what we were doing and that that same kind of communication is going on
8786280 thats what theyve done and they will continue to do over time based on what the need is so the intent is to communicate

8786282 weve come through a transformation this week it seemed as though someone had died early on tuesday night at training the lights switched back on we couldnt believe we could perform so poorly and thats no longer acceptable
8786283 weve taken it on the chin and this game on sunday cant come quickly enough
8786284 canterbury are capable of so much if they get on the front foot defensively if you dont shut them down theyll create so much space weve got to shut them down at set piece time
8786285 we accept we under performed and move forward we cant afford to have days like that hawkes bay
8786286 it feels a bit funny being in the other dressing room i played 136 games for that union
8786287 im a very proud canterbury man it will give me a great insight into coaching a team against canterbury
8786288 weve been training hard this year and wed won about half our games against arotea kiwi so we were pretty confident
8786289 i think the last 15 or 20 minutes was the difference for us weve been working hard on fitness for tournament and that showed
8786290 i just like the speed of hockey the fitness and the skills
8786291 i want to go to uni get into the canterbury team then eventually the black sticks from there
8786292 have a big player in the market they are customer are going to go there first
8786293 i know they changed the track at steel city and im looking forward to seeing it
8786294 having a perfect season will be a great way to wrap up my first championship and im just going to take it one moto at a time i just hope it doesnt rain i dont want to race a mud race this week
8786295 it is really important to me to finish second in the championship
8786296 ive had a pretty good season and that would be the perfect way to end it ive heard they made some changes to the track at steel city and im excited they also made changes at mt morris this year and they were really good so i expect the same for steel city
8786297 with the championship locked up i just want to get overall wins i need to have two good motos and i think i can do it it will be cool to finish my lites career with an overall win

8786360 theyre getting into the other sides heads on an important day for them i think making this news tonight would be smart but almost as useful is making news with the suggestion youll be making news
8786361 announcing the pick on friday cuts off obamas momentum leaking it thursday night cuts into the coverage of his speech in a huge way on the biggest night of s life he could end up with a split headline in the morning paper
8786362 mccain should make a clean steal of the spotlight after obama is done
8786363 let obama finish his show then mccain should swiftly step in if he leaks early obama will regain much if not most of the spotlight with his speech plus there still should be enough civility in the business to allow an opponent their moment in the sun
8786364 given the trouble mccain faces its probably worth the risk and if it is a choice that causes them problems in their base they also mute the level of public criticism

8786373 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8786374 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from
8786375 the united states is now more dependent on foreign oil than it ever was
8786376 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8786377 people think because of the basket in the outfield that there are no calls but one of the toughest calls ive personally had to make was on a ball hit to right field that hit in the net and came back that would be reviewable weve also had calls here where fans reached over the basket and that would also be reviewable

8786379 the commissioner bud selig has been adamant that this is limited use
8786380 i voted for what we have now because of all the new stadiums and because it was what the umpires wanted
8786381 in the past ive been one of the biggest purists but im comfortable with it and if the umpires feel they need it how could you possibly vote against it
8786382 there will be staff supervisors or former umpires in new york but they will offer no assistance

8786387 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
8786388 im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8786389 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8786390 but i dont know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers
8786391 i will eliminate for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8786392 what he should not do is what he will be criticized for not doing give a detailed policy speech this is not the place for that
8786393 not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
8786394 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8786395 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8786396 that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character

8786400 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and by the way john mccains been there for 26 of them
8786401 and in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels
8786402 and today we import triple the amount of oil that we had on the day that took office now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8786403 the men and women who gathered there couldve heard many things
8786404 im so proud of this record says snow patrols gary lightbody vocals guitars everybody played out of their skin garret jacknife lee continued his progression from maverick genius to one of the best producers in the world musically lyrically and sonically the best record weve made

8786406 on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
8786407 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time

8786409 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of

8786412 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8786413 i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8786414 a clean break from the politics of partisanship and bitter division

8786417 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree

8786419 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8786420 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8786421 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8786422 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war

8786426 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8786427 we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because mccain is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
8786428 we love al gore we believe he was cheated in the 2000 election and that he would have been a great president
8786429 were proud that he keeps on serving this country and the world

8786441 people of every creed and color from every walk of life
8786442 is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8786443 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8786444 failed presidency of john mccain saying he did not understand the struggles of normal americans and should stop questioning his patriotism
8786445 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8786446 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8786447 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8786448 i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home

8786456 the experience lincolns supporters valued most was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse

8786474 i believe that americas free market has been the engine of americas great progress its created a prosperity that is the envy of the world its led to a standard of living unmatched in history and it has provided great rewards to the innovators and risk takers who have made america a beacon for science and technology and discovery we are all in this together from ceos to shareholders from financiers to factory workers we all have a stake in each others success because the more americans prosper the more america prospers
8786475 most of the time it is best to leave markets alone

8786480 when john mccain said we could just muddle through in afghanistan i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9 11 and made clear that we must take out and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights
8786481 afghanistan is dicey i think there are certain areas of the country particularly along the pakistani border that are clearly not under the control of either
8786482 i am concerned about it but im not as concerned as i am about iraq today obviously or i would be talking about afghanistan but i believe if president hamid karzai can make the progress that he is making that in the long term we may muddle through it in afghanistan

8786541 that very week i had been toying with the idea of blogging going so far as to have set up an as yet unpublished first post
8786542 blogs and wikis are now becoming mainstream communication tools but who in the department of the navy is actually using them
8786543 were incredibly fortunate to have pete geren secretary of the u s army and general george casey chief of staff of the u s army join us via phone for the bloggers roundtable panel

8786546 doonesbury coms the sandbox dispatches from troops in iraq and afghanistan
8786547 that very week i had been toying with the idea of blogging going so far as to have set up an as yet unpublished first post
8786548 blogs and wikis are now becoming mainstream communication tools but who in the department of the navy is actually using them
8786549 jo ek loveku ki ga spo tuje ime pi e z veliko
8786550 p s e se ju na osetija pi e z veliko zakaj se
8786551 kako je e bilo z nixonom in mediji zadnji del njegovega
8786552 spo tovana darja ker iz objavljenih treh diagramov ne da
8786553 saj ni kaj za teoretizirati ob utek da se vse te je
8786554 being consistent being accurate with the football making good decisions
8786555 hes doing a great job of leading this offense and hes really taken control of the reins
8786556 and i really like the way hes approached it he wants to be the leader of this football team not just this offense but the entire football team
8786557 you are the quarterback and you are in control of the huddle and you are making checks at the line
8786558 this is the wide receivers team this is the offensive lines team this is the running backs team everyone works together and corrects things with each other
8786559 hes a critical thinker i know that from experience because he has beat me twice
8786560 when i came in as a freshman i didnt have a clue
8786561 being a senior and having that maturity i think i have come a long way since my freshman year definitely
8786562 playing a good defense like that and seeing how fast and well coached they were can get a little intimidating
8786563 but it also makes you realize that no one is invincible
8786564 the positive thing about having any storm hit you it will reveal any kind of frailty in the system
8786565 its not worth putting your life at risk if you have the means to get out
8786566 i had to put a fence up to keep them from running through my yard
8786567 out of towners dont know lexingtons law but the homeowners they know
8786568 we feel like we are doing a service by getting them out of the neighborhoods
8786569 weve got to give him some help weve got to give him help as coaches and the players have to also i dont think well be getting in drop back mode all day with a young quarterback weve got to establish the run and help him out
8786570 guys stepped up and protected him and that allowed some of our receivers to get open and make plays
8786571 when one part does its job its easier for the other parts to look good
8786572 ive told the guys that i know this is my first start but im going to come out and be confident and not get rattled
8786573 weve got all the confidence in the world in him
8786574 it will be a new experience for him even as a young guy hes telling us to run to the ball and get on the line and every play he calls he calls it confidently
8786575 im not trying to be andre woodson or the other guys kentucky has had in the past i dont have to try and make a play every time we have other great athletes who can make plays it might be third and seven or third and eight and we might run the ball and thats ok with our offensive line and running backs i may not have to always make a play on third down
8786576 its easy to stop the run if you get an extra hat down there in the box if they try and get an extra hat down there in the box weve got to throw the football
8786577 i just dont think were as good at running the deep routes as last year i think he can throw the deep ball weve just got to be able to get open and get over the top of some people
8786578 this is why i came here and this is what i want to do hopefully for a long time im confident in myself and our team that we can win this game im not putting any predictions out there but if we come out here play our game and make adjustments we can come out on top
8786579 hes prepared and practiced like a guy who its very important to him that he plays well
8786580 whatever was going to blow away has already blown away
8786581 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
8786582 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent
8786583 it is simply impossible to determine exactly where and when gustav will make final landfall
8786584 the chances of hurricane force winds within the next five days are essentially the same at each individual location from the florida panhandle coast westward through the entire coastline of louisiana
8786585 i think everyone has a hurricane preparedness plan that we might not have had previously
8786586 weve got a command center now that is hurricane proof that was being constructed when rita hit so we do now have a secured command center where some of your emergency responders can meet
8786587 some of our customers are talking about having us work this weekend to get product into the supply line to feed their customers
8786588 one of the things learned from rita is that we have more advanced planning better communications and people are taking these storms a lot more seriously than we did in the past
8786589 trust me as soon as they even mention we start looking at it we watch everything down there and try to react as best we can each day
8786590 we are working toward a full evacuation of shell operated assets in the gulf
8786591 we expect to evacuate the remaining 600 personnel on friday and saturday
8786592 we dont really know why the bottle failed and thats the key question for the investigation
8786593 sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurized contents
8786594 the preliminary report was a factual account of the incident and investigation to date
8786595 my current case is essentially to do with my treatment at the highest levels of the met in particular the discrimination i have been subjected to over a long period by the present commissioner sir ian blair
8786596 get in touch with your gun toting testosterone pumping cold blooded murdering side
8786597 it is of course unfortunate in the circumstances that we had to change the venue because we were all looking forward to a great awards night in pakistan
8786598 however it is good to bring such a prestigious event to the home of the icc
8786599 the lg icc awards are an opportunity to pay homage to the remarkable performances of the worlds top players
8786600 and a chance for lovers of the sport around the globe to reflect on some of the great cricketing feats they have witnessed over the previous 12 months
8786601 and were outraged by illegal warrantless wiretapping by bushist minions
8786602 this means it can spot names or numbers that crop up alongside anyone already of interest to the authorities and then catalogue any documents that contain such associates
8786603 as a tool to help the security services tackle crime and terrorism
8786604 authorized groups need to have direct access to communications between suspects whether it is individuals groups or organizations only then can they take appropriate action detect prevent and anticipate crimes and guarantee peace and security
8786605 from nontraditional sources such as public safety entities and private sector organizations
8786606 to anticipate identify prevent and or monitor criminal and terrorist activity
8786607 a vast database of names that feeds the nations terrorist watch list
8786608 would actually be less capable than the u s government terrorist tracking system it is meant to replace
8786609 the program appears to be on the brink of collapse after an estimated half billion dollars in taxpayer funding has been spent on it
8786610 technical flaws hinder terrorist watch list congress calls for investigation
8786611 recent weeks the government has fired most of the 862 private contractors from dozens of companies working on the railhead project and only a skeleton crew remains
8786612 calls to officials of boeing and sri were not immediately returned
8786613 currently there are no good patterns available to recognise terrorists he says and questions whether siemens has got around this
8786614 for a moratorium on the development of fusion technologies referring explicitly to the siemens intelligence platform
8786615 the efficiency and reliability of such tools is as yet unknown more surveillance does not necessarily lead to a higher level of societal security hence there must be a thorough examination of whether the resulting massive constraints on human rights are proportionate and justified
8786616 with these diverse significant orders in hand and other active projects with companies such as chevron we believe moormasters transition from a developmental to commercially consistent technology has occurred
8786617 the largest for republicans the 14 point increases george w bush gained in 2000 and that richard nixon enjoyed in 1968 and the 13 point bounce ronald reagan got in 1980 clinton and bush won their first races for president nixon who narrowly lost in 1960 won in 1968 by nearly half a million votes the smallest bounces were the 4 point drop john kerry saw in his margin against president bush in 2004 and the 3 point reduction george mcgovern endured in 1972 against president nixon both democrats lost these quick popularity boosts dont always mean much in 1964 president johnson and republican barry goldwater saw convention bounces of about the same size while in 1984 democrat walter mondales 16 point boost was double president reagans johnson and reagan won landslides in 2004 bush got the smallest gop bounce measured yet 2 points and was re elected

8786770 lo que sucedi con s nchez vilella nos hace conscientes de que en estas elecciones un voto por jirau es un voto por mayita y en contra del partido popular que nadie se equivoque el movimiento o map como lo llama jirau es un partido pol tico que est luchando contra el partido popular

8786775 we were so surprised we lived just around the corner

8786777 we spend all out time out here or on the deck looking at the harbour

8786780 people want to have their own style and our clothes shoes and jewellery are totally unique
8786781 the concept took a lot of research but it shows what can be done to help the environment
8786782 move in and circle around me we cant let them seize our stage too easily
8786783 we have told our union members to call a leave of absence to join the rally in bangkok to oust this government which has been damaging the country over the past seven months

8786798 se estremecieron de pasi n cuando escucharon a los cuatristas y trovadores de mapey all decidimos sellar el pacto con tony sobre el festival que presentaremos en san juan
8786799 esto lo hacemos en el marco del a o de la internacionalizaci n de la cultura puertorrique a seg n una proclama nuestra cultura ha viajado y tambi n ha recibido visitantes de otros pa ses
8786800 es una tremenda emoci n encontrarse con repentistas y decimistas de otros pa ses sobre todo de puerto rico que es una potencia de la d cima es muy enriquecedor para todas nuestras culturas porque m s all de las fronteras pol ticas hay muchas cosas que nos unen y las hay que vivir y disfrutar
8786801 hemos albergado en nuestro coraz n y en nuestras mentes este encuentro esperamos reciprocar las atenciones que nos han brindado cuando visitamos sus pa ses
8786802 esta iniciativa ofrece la oportunidad para que m s ni os se beneficien del servicio extraordinario que tenemos en el quehacer de la cultura tendremos una oferta cultural de excelencia para toda la familia esperamos que esto se convierta en un evento recurrente
8786803 los artistas pl sticos funcionamos desde la soledad y son pocas o ninguna las oportunidades que tenemos de estar frente a la gente este evento nos da esa posibilidad de ver las reacciones del p blico y abrirles esa puerta a un mundo que es bastante desconocido
8786804 yo no he participado en nada de esto y nunca habl en cuatro a os con el senador jorge de castro font
8786805 yo no voy a entrar en dimes y diretes sobre este asunto esto es un asunto que ya est referido al directorio del partido yo le he solicitado al secretario del partido que le garantice el debido proceso y eso es lo que vamos a estar haciendo
8786806 no creo que abone a nada que yo est contestando las docenas de acusaciones que l ha estado haciendo durante toda la semana
8786807 me consta de personal conocimiento que luis fortu o estuvo al tanto de todo esto para que rossell no llegara a la presidencia
8786808 fue cierto eso no es algo extraordinario cuando el ejecutivo es de un partido y la legislatura de otro es un asunto ordinario el que haya di logo y que busquen acuerdos entre las partes
8786809 estoy demasiado ocupado en el ltimo d a de un evento que solamente se da cada cuatro a os para estar enfocado en otros asuntos locales que puedo atender la semana que viene
8786810 yo no estaba metido en eso yo estaba haciendo mi trabajo en washington
8786811 entiendan que cuando le piden a uno que de un mensaje en prime time le est s hablando a todos los estados unidos

8786814 willie miranda mar n la agarr y se la pas pero el gobernador le empuj la mano dijo que no con la cabeza y ech su torso hacia atr s en la butaca
8786815 le respond que el gobernador hab a rechazado la bandera porque est acusado de cargos federales por corrupci n
8786816 el gobernador estaba pidiendo un voto ntegro a favor de obama pero no todos quisieron
8786817 tendr s la oportunidad de ver el gran acto de hipocres a del sr pedro pierluisi ante la estructura del partido dem crata
8786818 podr s observar a su compa ero de papeleta luis fortuno hablando barbaridades del candidato dem crata a la presidencia barack obama
8786819 arranc en la torre con el sonido de un coro cambiamos el olor del ambiente impregnando la ropa con diferentes olores hubo adem s una banda rumba callejera y hasta dos filas de carros que tocaban bocina y encend an las luces al ritmo de una partitura

8786822 es la promesa del esp ritu de estados unidos lo que un d a como hoy hace 45 a os reuni en washington a estadounidenses de todos los rincones de esta tierra frente al monumento a lincoln para escuchar a un joven predicador de georgia hablar de su sue o
8786823 esos hombres y mujeres pudieron haber escuchado palabras de rabia y discordia o que sucumbieran al miedo y a la frustraci n de tantos sue os pospuestos pero lo que esa gente escuch personas de cada credo y color es que en estados unidos nuestro destino est vinculado de una manera inextricable y que juntos nuestros sue os pueden ser uno solo
8786824 nos encontramos en un momento decisivo un momento en el que nuestra naci n est en guerra nuestra econom a en crisis y la promesa americana ha sido amenazada una vez m s
8786825 no todos estos desaf os han sido causados por el gobierno pero los errores en las respuestas son resultado directo de las pol ticas fragmentadas en washington y la fallida presidencia de george w bush
8786826 estados unidos nosotros somos mejores que estos ltimos ocho a os somos un pa s mejor que el que tenemos ahora
8786827 ma ana hoy regresaremos a la lucha pero esta noche senador le digo que ha hecho un buen trabajo

8786830 they are going to be fantastic games the rivalry is there between scotland and england we played against them a couple of years ago and got a victory it promises to be a great atmosphere in both games
8786831 our home form is very good its just our away form that has been very poor if we can get that right it will go a long way to getting through to the next round
8786832 we dont have to travel far and the fixtures have fallen nicely weve got a home game against villarreal inbetween the games against liverpool and chelsea
8786833 its a big one we seem to make a habit of drawing the european champions
8786834 weve had man united ac milan and barcelona three years in a row theres no free passes in europe but its great for the fans wouldnt it be fabulous if we could get through and meet united later on in the competition
8786835 with our spanish contigent that will be a couple of very big games and there will be a lot of attention focused on those
8786836 theyve got some very good players and if theres one team in the last pot we didnt want to sign it was them
8786837 we know all of the teams quite well for different reasons
8786838 we have always been the bridesmaids weve been to four semi finals and a final we want to go one better this year
8786839 for us its great to be welcomed back to the champions league with a classic encounter against real madrid
8786840 but theres also zenit who represent the progression of east european teams
8786841 fue una pieza que vi por primera vez en el 1996 en m xico recuerdo que inicialmente no quer a verla por pensar que ser a algo de mal gusto o una parodia pero un d a decid ir a verla y me gust tanto que decid traerla a puerto rico habl con celia para que la montara aqu con actores puertorrique os
8786842 no se trata de hombres vestidos de mujeres sino de hombres interpretando a mujeres hay una gran diferencia entre una cosa y la otra ellos est n vestidos de mujeres usan las medias los zapatos los trajes pero no usan cabello postizo y mantienen su voz varonil
8786843 esa integridad es lo que nos ha mantenido por tantos a os celia lo que quer a probar era la fuerza esc nica de estos personajes que lorca siempre los puso mujeres pero utilizando hombres en todo este tiempo nunca hemos tenido una cr tica a los cinco minutos de empezar la obra la gente no sabe si son hombres o mujeres

8786853 mobs have been attacking minority christians in retaliation for the killing of local religious leader swami lakhmananda saraswati

8786875 se limit a transmitir la foto fija de posiciones ya conocidas
8786876 no pod a esperarse otra cosa por parte del vicepresidente revisar la posici n del gobierno hubiera sido tanto como reconocer una derrota sobre el fondo de la cuesti n en debate
8786877 dej claro que lo que se discute no es tanto la bilateralidad o multilateralidad para alcanzar el acuerdo como el significado de la bilateralidad
8786878 aunque el debate no sirvi para avanzar en el acuerdo s contribuy a relativizar algunos argumentos
8786879 tiene un serio problema para conciliar los intereses de las comunidades aut nomas que son divergentes
8786880 no es imposible llegar a un acuerdo que satisfaga a todas las comunidades pero supondr a indudablemente un fuerte aumento de los recursos que el estado no est en condiciones de afrontar en estos momentos
8786881 fue el propio solbes quien compar el problema de la financiaci n auton mica con un sudoku el tiempo le ha dado la raz n probablemente a su pesar
8786882 tiene ante s una dura prueba que le enfrenta a partidos cuyos votos necesita en el congreso como ciu y erc que ayer dejaron claro que su apoyo no le va a salir gratis a zapatero
8786883 se fue dibujando una realidad implacable el gobierno tiene su propio modelo de c mo han de financiarse los servicios que prestan las comunidades aut nomas lo ha cuantificado y har las provisiones necesarias en los presupuestos del estado
8786884 que solbes acudi al debate mejor preparado que cuantos le interpelaban qued demostrado con la profusi n de datos que aport
8786885 pero fue excesiva por arrogante la pretensi n del vicepresidente de ignorar la vigencia del estatut frente a las dem s leyes estatales que regulan la financiaci n
8786886 una vez m s el enorme desencuentro entre el gabinete socialista y las fuerzas pol ticas de catalunya que fueron contundentes al juzgar en t rminos negativos la actitud gubernamental
8786887 la falta de apoyos estables de zapatero en este mandato de superpone al proceso con los cual toda la discusi n acaba rebotando sobre los presupuestos generales del estado
8786888 no promete giros favorables ni posiciones distintas al borrador ya conocido y duramente criticado por el conseller castells
8786889 todos deber n hacer un esfuerzo para acercar posiciones y despertar confianza
8786890 cumplir zapatero los compromisos que pact con los nacionalistas en el estatut
8786891 se deduce que el gobierno est dispuesto a soplar y sorber al mismo tiempo es decir a satisfacer a todo el mundo
8786892 no parece muy razonable que con un retroceso tan acusado de las recaudaciones el gasto p blico no s lo no se reduzca sino que se dispare
8786893 ser a reprobable que el gobierno obligado por la aritm tica parlamentaria y por la crisis econ mica optase por transferir al mbito de la negociaci n presupuestaria los esfuerzos que debe realizar para alcanzar un acuerdo ptimo y duradero en el consejo de pol tica fiscal y financiera y en especial para conseguir que la generalitat adopte una postura m s razonable capaz de comprometer tambi n a ciu
8786894 es un argumento fingido que deja en el aire el interrogante de por qu precisamente el psoe ha alentado durante semanas el debate sobre un previsible adelanto electoral que no se va a producir
8786895 no era descabellado pensar que por oportunismo partidista a ferraz le conven a un oto o electoral para distraer la atenci n de la crisis econ mica el cruento debate sobre la financiaci n y el desaf o soberanista en el pa s vasco
8786896 es probable que la crisis econ mica a n transite por una fase dif cil y que el desgaste del psoe sea a n mayor

8786911 for a recession the economy is certainly growing very quickly
8786912 a lot of that growth is driven off exports and pessimists might say that cant continue during slowing growth overseas but i would say this happened precisely during the period of slowing growth overseas this is still an economy that faces slow times but not a recession
8786913 a lot of the monthly indicators are suggesting recession but things like new orders and gdp suggest the economy is improving
8786914 if the us economy were growing at its potential pace the unemployment rate would not have risen a full percentage point over the past year
8786915 children are most at risk from diseases and suffer physical and mental distress from being moved from their homes to relief camps

8786918 well they are really difficult to communicate with so can you take care of it and tell me later
8786919 because of the fear of change or the unknown we could choose the status quo we could refuse to move forward we could remain stuck between dreams loves careers and callings and instead of working on casting our sails and allowing a second wind to propel the next half of our lifes journey we could drown in boredom and regress to smaller versions of ourselves refusing to learn anything new and becoming judgmental and bitter over lives unlived
8786920 us is still working on the revised draft and india is still demanding clean and unconditional waiver while there is still a distance to go the proposal to give india a clean exemption from global nuclear trade standards is in deep trouble
8786921 as aca had predicted but to the apparent surprise of the indian and us governments more than 20 states essentially said no thanks and proposed more than 50 amendments and modifications that would establish some basic but vitally important restrictions and conditions on nuclear trade with india
8786922 many of these amendments track with the restrictions and conditions established in the 2006 us legislation regulating us nuclear trade with india which include the termination of nuclear trade if india resumes testing a ban on the transfer of uranium enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing technology a requirement for permanent and unconditional facility specific safeguards and a review mechanism
8786923 it is vital that these and other states stand their ground
8786924 there are signs however that the process of developing a revised draft is taking so long that the other 44 members will not have sufficient time to analyse the proposal and work through their respective national political processes to enable them to take a decision by next week
8786925 some indian officials and commentators have suggested that new delhi may walk away from the deal if the nsg establishes hyde act like requirements if that occurs so be it
8786926 the indian governments demands have been so unreasonable that the bush administration simply cant ram an india specific exemption through the nsg without accepting substantial changes and some common sense restrictions and conditions
8786927 in addition many nsg states have done their homework and are being reminded why the proposal to exempt india would be a nonproliferation disaster ngos and experts from nearly two dozen countries have been working for months to publish opeds encourage newspapers to write editorials critical of the deal send letters to their foreign ministers and meet with their parliamentarians to help encourage their governments to help reduce the damage to the nonproliferation system

8786984 she warned us that we should lock our doors be prepared for her family to come back and be prepared for them to wreak bloody vengeance
8786985 all i kept thinking is i have to maintain consciousness because im afraid to fall down or pass out who knows what they would do at that point
8786986 i absolutely believe hes innocent he would never kidnap children its not in his nature
8786987 the day that i heard they the district attorneys office werent going to press charges was very difficult day for me because i didnt do anything
8786988 they maybe been roughed up in the sense that they kidnapped our children
8786989 i feel like ive been failed by the police by any kind of justice system whatsoever

8786995 the polls are overestimating obama just as he is overestimating himself
8786996 obama ites are all over the place passing out volunteer cards
8786997 based on the repetitive lies that the defendant has told we do not know with whom the child is or even if the child is alive
8786998 she continued to claim ignorance and at times laughed about the situation

8787005 i need to go by the bank have a little spending cash

8787011 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8787012 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain
8787013 the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8787014 from the temple grounds barack obama will outline an agenda for america that includes raising taxes increasing spending putting government bureaucrats in charge of health care and isolating america from the benefits of the global economy
8787015 while barack obama will talk about his plans to tax the rich and cut taxes on the middle class he will not say that his record includes voting for higher taxes 94 times and voting for a tax increase on those making just 42 000 per year
8787016 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8787017 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8787018 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow but i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet 21st century challenges with a 20th century bureaucracy
8787019 i do not make a promise that we can reduce it by 2013 because i think it is important for us to make some critical investments right now in americas families
8787020 ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars
8787021 and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and 5 million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced

8787031 thats better than having it come out little by little after youve already hired somebody
8787032 i made a commitment to stay in the job for at least a year
8787033 i met the oldest child but not the others which my mother said was crazy to accept the job without meeting all the kids so well see
8787034 that one i think was a ruse and she just wanted a summer job

8787038 my friend said every single thing in there was a response to a failed experience with a nanny

8787041 i got a few from people who told me i shouldnt let my kids watch
8787042 ive nannied for a couple of families on the upper east side and i thought it was hilarious and true
8787043 she said its four kids its nonstop and that she has expectations and if a person doesnt meet them things dont work out well
8787044 i sent the ad to one of my old sitters and she said she felt it was pretty accurate which sort of stung a little bit

8787057 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8787058 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8787059 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8787060 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8787061 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8787062 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8787063 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8787064 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8787065 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8787066 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8787067 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8787068 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8787069 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience

8787072 i had completed the rehab on my shoulder and had every intention to be part of the team this coming season unfortunately coach leitao informed me last sunday that my scholarship was no longer available to me due to academic eligibility
8787073 i want to thank the university of virginia for everything it has done for me over the past three years i especially want to thank the fans my teammates and all who have supported me during my time here i hope that they felt the emotion that i played with and saw that i gave it my all every time i wore the virginia jersey
8787074 i took great pride in being a student athlete at the university of virginia
8787075 i could not see myself transferring to another school or playing for another college basketball team therefore i have decided to forgo my last year of ncaa eligibility and pursue my dream of playing basketball at the professional level i have retained sports international group as my agency and i am excited to work with mike and the rest of the sig team

8787087 we found some things there that lead us to believe that we have some actual victims of abuse at the hands of mr dewey in our community
8787088 the preliminary information im receiving is this could very well turn out to be maybe one of the largest child porn cases weve dealt with in the office
8787089 i feel like we need to do something about it
8787090 for somebody older to do something like to a kid its sick

8787167 and theyre basically able to utilise the assets because our team has brought lego characters to life
8787168 my understanding is that they will use the engine the maya files where the characters come to life but theyll be creating animated i think its a 20 minute cartoon im personally quite intrigued to see how it comes out lego every time theyve had a new brand out theyve done some cgi stuff as well but i think this will be quite different

8787170 after the eggplants have been roasted fry the aromatics in about 100 ml of oil bear in mind that no oil has been added prior to this process so 100 ml approx 6 tablespoons is not at all unreasonable when the air is dancing with the unmistakable fragrance of the saut ed aromatics add in the freshly blended red chilies and continue frying i stir only occasionally because i want some of the chilies to be left idle on the base of the wok until it chars a little to give it a smoky flavor and also because im lazy

8787226 the prat is very real in workplaces and is an extremely dangerous species
8787227 these arent necessarily bad characteristics however a prat is usually acting out these personality traits in an adverse way
8787228 the prat may promote an air of confidence however theyre usually immensely insecure and many are simply covering up for a lack of work
8787229 the introverted sensing feeling and perceiving personalities are most likely to be top of the prats hit list
8787230 the prat often displays all the hallmarks of a bully
8787231 if you dont assert yourself then you are reinforcing the behaviour
8787232 better bosses are more likely not to promote the prat
8787233 employers should be looking not for the prat but for strong employees who also show care

8787241 we were in the park the other day and there was a guy sitting on the ground he walked right up and sat down by that man and asked him if he was his daddy
8787242 men do not even have to be of the same race for him to ask if they are his daddy so he is not identifying with men who look like him he is just identifying with men this is a daily routine for us and it is heartbreaking

8787250 when i give something i do not possess i give a false and dangerous gift a gift that looks like love but is in reality loveless a gift given more from my need to prove myself than from the others need to be cared for that kind of giving is not only loveless but faithless based on the arrogant and mistaken notion that god has no way of channeling love to the other except through me
8787251 though usually regarded as the result of trying to give too much burnout in my experience results from trying to give what i do not possess burnout is a state of emptiness but it does not result from giving all i have it merely reveals the nothingness from which i was trying to give in the first place
8787252 when the gift i give to the other is integral to my own nature it will renew itself and me even as i give it away

8787322 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way
8787323 but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8787324 finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8787325 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and by the way john mccain has been there for 26 of them

8787327 natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power

8787330 for while senator mccain was turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 i stood up and opposed this war knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face
8787331 and today as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration even after we learnt that iraq has a 79bn surplus while were wallowing in deficits john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8787332 if john mccain wants to follow george bush with more tough talk and bad strategy that is his choice but it is not the change that america needs
8787333 end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan

8787349 the canadian economy likely managed to eke out a trace of growth in the second quarter just avoiding a second consecutive quarter of declining gdp and averting a technical recession for now
8787350 the canadian economy will do well to grind out even modest growth in the second half of the year with consumer confidence hobbled the housing market cooling and u s activity likely staying in very low gear
8787351 i dont get too concerned with the short term macroeconomic data
8787352 our stock market has vastly outperformed others in the world and i expect that will continue to be the case

8787428 n o sei o que voc s pensam mas eu n o estou disposto a apostar em uma mudan a de 10
8787429 n o acredito que o senador mccain n o se importe com a vida dos americanos o que penso que ele realmente n o sabe o que est acontecendo como poss vel que ele defina a classe m dia como a de uma fam lia que tem uma renda superior a us 5 milh es por ano
8787430 a cren a de que podemos conseguir tudo que sonhamos caracterizou este pa s mas agora esta cren a est em perigo porque estamos em um momento em que estamos em guerra nossa economia est agitada e o sonho americano est de novo sob amea a
8787431 o atual governo n o o respons vel por todos estes problemas mas o fracasso ao enfrent los sim culpa do governo fracassado de george w bush e da pol tica feita em washington

8787455 has a strong dmca policy takes active steps to limit incidents of infringement on its web site and works diligently to keep unauthorized works off its site

8787466 its sort of like the ridiculousness of building a five story structure like knowing that driving a car kills the environment and still doing it its a ridiculous thing to climb up five stories tall and sit in a chair
8787467 the record presented demonstrates that far from encouraging copyright infringement veoh has a strong dmca digital millennium copyright act policy takes active steps to limit incidents of infringement on its website and works diligently to keep unauthorized works off its website
8787468 one of the big issues here was whether there was an awareness of the copyright infringement
8787469 and in this case veoh had a system in place to terminate pirated files

8787480 that equals out to about a medal and a half for each hour he spent in combat there were infantry guys grunts on the ground who had more than 7 000 hours in combat and i can tell you that there were times and situations where im sure a prison cell would have looked pretty good to them by comparison the question really is how many guys got that number of medals for not being shot down

8787490 ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education keep our water clean and our toys safe invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology
8787491 it was a deeply substantive speech full of policy detail full of people other than the candidate centered overwhelmingly on domestic economic anxiety
8787492 what he didnt do was give an airy abstract dreamy confection of rhetoric
8787493 if the rove republicans thought they were playing with a patsy they just got a reality check
8787494 i may not agree with all of his policies but i think his message of hope for our country means more
8787495 its hard to imagine there are people in this country that can not at least feel inspired by obama even if they do not plan to vote for him
8787496 ive said it before months and months ago i should say it again tonight this is a remarkable man at a vital moment america would be crazy to throw this opportunity away america must not throw this opportunity away
8787497 it doesnt matter what we do drill research alternative energy raise cafe standards in 2018 well still be using oil
8787498 even if we discovered a magic source of clean renewable energy tomorrow wed still be using a lot of oil because transitions of that magnitude take time
8787499 from a democratic perspective he made the argument for government something we havent heard in a while
8787500 obama moved into ample detail on what he wants to do with the economy and made the case for a failed bush mccain foreign policy ive been looking for the details for a while and while not a wonky speech there was enough there there to hang your hat on
8787501 the race is not always to the swift nor battle to the strong but to the one that endures to the end

8787503 i think its picked up in the last couple years were seeing more people come out people are finding it more important to buy local and eat fresh
8787504 we get cold in the winter the nighttime temperatures drop into the 20s sometimes lower its the right climate for pears
8787505 years ago people used to come and pick large volumes for canning
8787506 youve heard of the 200 hamburger were the 50 peach
8787507 weve got people whove been coming here for generations the farm is 110 years old

8787512 distribution of a work being prepared for commercial distribution by making it available on a computer network accessible to members of the public
8787513 felony punishable by imprisonment for not more than three years or if the offense was committed for commercial advantage or private financial gain for not more than five years
8787514 fbi uploader confesses to pre releasing guns n roses tracks
8787515 we are still on dialup so we are going to rip the cd for our buddies sorry axel we could only get 30 guys to chip in on this album for a group buy and some of that was pitty donations we all have hear the album sucks but we want the mp3s for our collection
8787516 we stick to the easy stuff so we can call it a day early on
8787517 if its weed and mp3 files we cant go wrong
8787518 he has thought this through and he continues to move forward in an area that involves obviously the pak military his authorities over the frontier corps as well and so expectations for instantaneous results i think are probably a little bit too high
8787519 more than anything else i think it was that we clearly went through what the challenges are the specifics of it what we think the threat is how to get at it
8787520 there is no need to make it easy for outsiders to gain intelligence by looking at browser data this is a neat concept
8787521 i hope they make it tunable looks like 10 sites need to track you before ipb kicks in that number should be settable it would be nice if it links into some sort of reputation based system to help give blocking suggestions
8787522 well have to wait until ie 8 ships before we can truly see how well microsoft has implemented these privacy features some of which are already present in alternative browsers like apples safari

8787524 enabling users to be in control starts with making users aware of the issues
8787525 theyre saying lower it information technology spending is spreading that is evidence of a global slowdown in it spending this certainly isnt good news for tech overall
8787526 dells outlook is for slower spending especially in asia and western europe
8787527 strategic actions to accelerate growth in certain areas of our business affected gross margins this quarter
8787528 its a really tough tech market and dell is obviously cutting costs but it wasnt enough to offset the pressure on gross margin
8787529 what people on the street wanted to see was revenue growth and a solid gross margin number because if you sell things for no profit to some extent whats the point this indicates that they might have to streamline even more now
8787530 our enterprise business in europe is doing quite well but our consumer presence there is in fact very small
8787531 we know we need to build broader and stronger relationships with our partners there and we will
8787532 in this climate technology companies are trying to grow their businesses with a mind set of getting as many customers as they can
8787533 in some cases that means forgoing profit as was the case with dell i am sure that they will solve the pricing and cost structure issues and get back on the path in contrast other companies had a tough time growing but remained profitable
8787534 and the ones that executed did both and they should be commended emc comes to mind as a good example of getting back on the path to operating leverage
8787535 we recognize that assignment is an option that individuals may wish to exercise it is in no way pushed upon kde contributors
8787536 there are also other avenues of copyright assignment available besides the fla but we believe this is the easiest way to get it done with little fuss
8787537 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8787538 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8787539 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8787540 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8787541 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8787542 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8787543 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8787544 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8787545 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8787546 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8787547 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8787548 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8787549 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8787550 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8787551 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8787552 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8787553 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8787554 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8787555 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8787556 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8787557 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8787558 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8787559 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8787560 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president
8787561 we had a nine inch rain that came on friday afternoon and after that by midnight there was water coming in the porches

8787570 racism has long been an unconscionable and contradictory stain on the great american enterprise a demonstration that skin color is irrelevant to success in politics at the highest level would be very timely
8787571 how sad then that barack obamas acceptance speech at the democratic national convention showed that his own success is not based on the content of his character
8787572 obama is not an authentic fulfillment of martin luther kings dream articulated so memorably 45 years ago to the day he is a charlatan and a demagogue mimicking kings rhetorical style but sporting a huge fork in his tongue with the left side grotesquely swollen
8787573 today the leftist obama who voted to raise taxes pretended he now plans to
8787574 the fact that cnns commentators are having orgasms over the speech is further testament to its totalitarian credentials and implications
8787575 the goal of america martin luther king reminded us 45 years ago is
8787576 i expect they will go over to that point next
8787577 that was always the best place to set salmon nets and there are always salmon in the area

8787579 non destructive testing is an important step in the production of much of our modern infrastructure and machinery and the demand for it is growing
8787580 i feel like ive made some sort of difference to help protect the limestone barrens
8787581 i know its a hectic time for some folks i just invite them to slow down wear their seat belts and dont drink and drive in order to arrive alive
8787582 its pretty basic for us if you are going to be on the roads be there safely and lawfully just slow down a little bit and get to where you are going safely
8787583 strictly speaking from the perspective of elevated levels of vehicle traffic its just a compilation of numbers bad road conditions plus the number of vehicles means greater chances for accidents
8787584 if people will just slow down and buckle up leave the stresses that they might be experiencing out of the car and focus on where they are going lawfully and safely that always helps
8787585 we are concerned that everybody has a safe weekend and nobody gets injured or killed
8787586 we encourage the public to be responsible in their driving habits
8787587 people should know that if they are out friday night or saturday night and they get home at two or three oclock in the morning and have had a few too many they should keep in mind the alcohol takes a while to get out of their system
8787588 well their blood alcohol concentration could be above the legal limit
8787589 on bright red days how good it feels to be a horse and kick my heels
8787590 some days of course feels sort of brown then i feels slow and low low down
8787591 why do we always end up in a pet shop
8787592 just out of curiosity you always visit pet shops whenever we hang out
8787593 if you want to see reasoned analysis at its best you have to read the paragraph farmer
8787594 my friend patrick ohannigan shows why he is the jimi hendrix of pundits
8787595 frankly i think patrick ohannigan ought to be out there making a bazillion dollars from his writing
8787596 i just was running the other girl got shot she was screaming thats where the screaming came from everyone thought she was screaming because she was scared but she was hit
8787597 they come in theyre in a coma they cant give you medical history they cant tell you what medications theyre on and theyre bleeding
8787598 we can get onto this secure medical network look up and see if the patients there
8787599 i think a universal system where they can pull up your records will help people like me that really needs the help and will cut down on the people who go from one hospital to the next just to get painkillers and stuff like that
8787600 its a win win situation for the patients and the physicians
8787601 ive got to pack get ready to go and get on the road
8787602 we take some water for us to get down there and just in case we get stranded we take more than enough
8787603 im excited to be able to go and help people but on the other side i feel bad that peoples lives are about to change
8787604 ive got talents and skills that i can give back
8787605 why sit at home and watch tv when i can go help and make a difference
8787606 i think it still could be better especially i was 4 1 up in the first set and then i let it go to 4 all said the russian who has reached the finals in six of her last seven tournaments including the games and the french open
8787607 i was lucky that i hold my serve there is much more room for me to play better
8787608 i feel overdue but youve got to win it to deserve it im always expecting more from myself i would love to win even more than what i do

8787617 its very exciting to be part of something like this helping find good young players its amazing to see how talented the kids out there actually are
8787618 but its horrible when i have to tell someone theyve not made it to the next round just seeing the disappointment on their face is awful
8787619 they have a good idea themselves if theyve not done too well but its really difficult to actually tell them ive never done anything like that before
8787620 when theyre walking over i know if im going to put them through or not then youre just trying to comfort them trying to soften the blow a bit but its very hard you can see the disappointment in their faces when you tell them the bad news
8787621 its probably one of the worst things ive ever had to do
8787622 then of course you get the ones who are really nervous while they wait for your decision and the joy they get from it is brilliant
8787623 when i was a kid wed be shooting against a wall aiming at road signs with jackets down for goals stuff like that
8787624 it was great for things like accuracy and helping control because on different surfaces you obviously get weird bounces if youre playing on a road its much more difficult to get your touch right so when you come to a proper game it seems easier to play
8787625 im not saying i wouldnt have been a professional if i hadnt played street football but it certainly helped me and i get benefits from it even now
8787626 hopefully the lads and girls who dont make it will be back next year to show what they can do because its all about how you react to disappointments

8787651 he has great flair and something that would be nice to bring into our team
8787652 we have flair players already but he is another option and he could light up the league
8787653 if arsene said to us i want this guy and hes 30million can i buy him the answer is yes
8787654 absolutely yes it would be no problem its not our decision who he spends on nor will it ever be we back him totally

8787697 the guys that im playing are not guys that im 100 percent expected to beat if theres a chance i can lose the match youre going to take it very seriously
8787698 theres no point in looking ahead you understand whats going on in the draw and which half of the draw youre in and where the top seeds are
8787699 but it doesnt make me start looking into semis quarter finals because i only made the quarter finals of a slam once at wimbledon this year
8787700 this was a very very disappointing loss for me but its something that i have to accept

8787747 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this

8787749 i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission
8787750 the real point is does this just feed into the growing perception that what we have is one big glitzy production
8787751 but really after the crowd files out after the fireworks take place the question remains what is left and is this person ready to be president of the united states

8787754 you have got people encouraged to buy a block of land way out of the city and they are having to travel for three hours a day to commute thats not sustainable
8787755 people there live in town houses or terrace houses the houses are never one storey and you have got the population that lives closer to the city
8787756 we have to curtail land subdivisions at the extremities of the city the other option is to put in some very fast trains to regional centres somewhere like geelong could be an attractive destination for working and living
8787757 the population is still growing and theres a demand for these properties
8787758 its near impossible to dictate to the market what should happen the thing thats keeping victorias economy very competitive compared to the mining states is we are very competitive in housing
8787759 i then bumped into him shopping about five days ago and we shared a laugh and he told me about his plans for a holiday
8787760 he seemed terrific but that doesnt mean anything because people keep this stuff to themselves
8787761 he would have always fought such dark feelings but god knows what overwhelmed him on wednesday
8787762 he gave a very insightful performance about a person dealing with some very tough things
8787763 costello is undeniably the liberal partys best political asset now that howard is gone
8787764 so much turns on whether he recovers the will to serve
8787765 mostly costello kept his disappointment in check refraining from the odd bitter comment would have been heroic virtue in a saint let alone an ambitious politician
8787766 he never challenged because he didnt want to wreck the government in order to lead it
8787767 we are going to celebrate the public life and recognise it so far of peter costello
8787768 whoever didnt get picked for republican vp today may be a lucky republican
8787769 it is not just that the american side could not restrain the georgian leadership from this criminal act the american side in effect armed and trained the georgian army
8787770 why spend years holding difficult negotiations and looking for complicated compromises in ethnic conflicts its easier to arm one of the parties and push it to kill the other party and the job is done
8787771 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president
8787772 it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders
8787773 therefore they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8787774 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate it sounds not rational
8787775 those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defence officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8787776 what was that gentlemans purpose of being among the special forces and what he is doing today i so far cannot answer
8787777 we have been looking for the holder of the passport but havent been able to find him we know that he is a resident in the state of texas
8787778 it is not just that the american side could not restrain the georgian leadership from this criminal act the american side in effect armed and trained the georgian army
8787779 all the actresses present at the venue didnt have say on the songs they wanted to perform on it was only katrina who could select her favourite tracks not just that since the show is about the making of akshay as the superstar he makes an appearance in all the songs of the other actresses however katrina will be the only one who will get to perform with akki

8787786 they the braves arent coming back next year are they dad
8787787 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8787788 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8787789 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8787790 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8787791 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8787792 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8787793 financially viable with earnings that adequately meet our operating expenses
8787794 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8787795 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8787796 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8787797 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8787798 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8787799 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8787800 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8787801 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8787802 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8787803 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8787804 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8787805 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8787806 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8787807 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8787808 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8787809 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8787810 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8787811 who are open to doing something on the production side
8787812 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8787813 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8787814 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8787815 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8787816 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8787817 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8787818 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8787819 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8787820 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8787821 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8787822 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8787823 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8787824 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8787825 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8787826 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8787827 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8787828 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8787829 on the basis of the physical damage to the aircrafts forward cargo hold and cabin it is evident that the number 4 passenger oxygen cylinder sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurized contents julian walsh acting atsb executive director said today
8787830 the passengers were obviously very lucky atsb investigator julian walsh said in canberra
8787831 it was evident that one passenger oxygen cylinder had sustained a sudden failure and forceful discharge of its pressurised contents into the aircraft hold rupturing the fuselage in the vicinity of the wing fuselage leading edge fairing
8787832 the cylinder had been propelled upward by the force of the discharge puncturing the cabin floor and entering the cabin adjacent to the second main cabin door
8787833 the cylinder had subsequently impacted the door frame door handle and overhead panelling before falling to the cabin floor and exiting the aircraft through the ruptured fuselage
8787834 a number of allied aircraft had been reported as missing in the area in particular b25 mitchells and a number of kittyhawk aircraft
8787835 the adf is gathering information and making plans to visit the site to confirm the reports
8787836 we had a few police officers on the 19 man trek one was taking photos with a large lens of the trees and flowers
8787837 he then discovered what looks like the remains of a body
8787838 i couldnt make it out at first it wasnt until the wind blew that you could really see it is in a harness there are goggles and it appears to be caught up in cables so presumably it is an airman
8787839 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8787840 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8787841 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8787842 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table

8787850 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8787851 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8787852 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8787853 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8787854 whatever was going to blow away has already blown away
8787855 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
8787856 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent
8787857 it is simply impossible to determine exactly where and when gustav will make final landfall
8787858 the chances of hurricane force winds within the next five days are essentially the same at each individual location from the westward through the entire coastline of louisiana
8787859 the important thing was i had to come back in the third set and im happy with the victory
8787860 the positive thing about having any storm hit you it will reveal any kind of frailty in the system
8787861 its not worth putting your life at risk if you have the means to get out
8787862 ggf 15 5 gamer girl friday will be late how naughty
8787863 there are regions affected by the storm that our teams have not been able to reach
8787864 the majority of victims died when their houses collapsed or were killed by falling trees others drowned when they tried to cross swollen rivers
8787865 regardless of its predicted path it is important for citizens in the
8787866 we know hull are a great side they are probably a top four team with everybody fit and playing well wellens said
8787867 were preparing for the hull weve played over the last few years not the hull lying 11th in the table because the personnel has not changed that much theyve got internationals throughout their squad
8787868 weve got quality in our team as well and i think its more about concentrating on what we can do rather than worrying about hull
8787869 im really excited and looking forward to it he said
8787870 the older you get the more you appreciate it its going to be a special weekend people expect so much weve created that expectation with the way weve been performing in recent years but thats a good place to be
8787871 weve got players used to performing on the big stage and hopefully that will work in our favour
8787872 last year was difficult for us because nobody expected catalans to win he said
8787873 there was so much pressure around us in the build up and there was more relief than anything at the end of the game were on a winning streak at the moment and were doing the right things and preparing well
8787874 its the biggest game i have ever played in and that goes for a lot of the team he said
8787875 i might never get an opportunity like this again everybody knows what st helens are capable of and their form speaks for itself
8787876 they are a team that you cant underestimate but weve got a good run of luck against them we enjoying playing against them and im sure that if we perform on the day were capable of beating them
8787877 i used to watch them on the telly in finals when i was younger as me and all my family were and are fans
8787878 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8787879 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8787880 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8787881 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8787882 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8787883 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8787884 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8787885 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8787886 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8787887 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8787888 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8787889 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8787890 if i look at the situation in the second quarter we would have to say it was more self inflicted
8787891 whenever youre restarting growth what i can tell you is its an imprecise process there were some parts of the business where we were probably too aggressive
8787892 it is going to cost a lot of money to expand their business

8787895 vendor and customer experience weighs heavily in the leaders quadrant all of these vendors have demonstrated that they have significant network management and outsourcing experience and understand the dynamics needed to deliver network centric it services successfully
8787896 eds remains focused on delivering world class network services that help our clients manage the ever increasing complexities of aligning their communications and network needs with their business strategy
8787897 in my opinion gartners recognition of eds in the leaders quadrant for worldwide managed and professional network service providers validates our global strategy and investments in the network services market

8787899 studies have proven that early education can help to improve a students chances at a better academic life in later years
8787900 with the introduction of hp notebooks to this age group we are further enhancing the childrens development by offering them the technologies that will be standard learning tools in later grades we are giving these students a jump start on learning
8787901 creative tools such as the hp mini note pc help keep students engaged in learning and allow them to acquire and develop skills they need for the future
8787902 with the hp mini note students participating in lester b pearsons kindergarten for four year olds program will have the opportunity to use technology to create new ideas make discoveries and build their knowledge like never before
8787903 were not stepping up and solving the problems like we should were good at finger pointing and were good at talking about the way the world should be but were falling short on delivering those ideals

8787920 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8787921 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8787922 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8787923 these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8787924 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8787925 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8787926 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
8787927 we are positioning dell to win in a new era of global it spending
8787928 could you name some affordable cars that look like sports cars dont include corvette or viper is there
8787929 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher toward the 120 level
8787930 if this turns out to be a non event the market could really come roaring back down
8787931 it seems there will be at the very least a slight hit to production
8787932 but everything is up in the air until monday or tuesday
8787933 grosvenor has around 15 or 16 it champions which is a bit above average for the north
8787934 but grosvenor is past the stage where champions are needed technology has now become part of the furniture and pupils and teachers cant do without it
8787935 in the past if you had one child up at the blackboard you would have had 25 other students just sitting around barely engaging switching from blackboards to laptops to interactive whiteboard means they can all participate by manipulating whats happening on the whiteboard and handling tasks ive set them on their laptops
8787936 students themselves are a lot more empowered in the classroom they would use info mapper gis software but many of them are independently using technologies like google earth and wikipedia
8787937 classically trained students would use speedius music software to conduct an entire orchestra while rock guitarists use garage band to develop music sequences
8787938 is whats occurring in the classroom students are moving beyond the images they are seeing in computer games to actually using cad cam computer aided manufacturing to develop real products they would use a technology called solidworks an industry standard to design a 3d object model it and possibly get it manufactured theyve left the world of t squares behind and theyre not working on some watered down piece of software but something they may use in the working world they respect that
8787939 i would use technologies like excel and powerpoint to teach maths and statistics and across northern ireland maths teachers are getting together to share graphs they would use to teach on whiteboards they are getting together to share their knowledge and cascade that across the schools network in northern ireland
8787940 the idea behind learningni is to get educators and learners to think about their learning and how they interact with resources
8787941 language teachers are uploading mp3 podcasts to act as student aids and as part of their performance related staff development scheme every member of staff this year has met their objective of uploading courses to learningni
8787942 its good to go to a place where no one annoys you
8787943 weve all been blown away by the way schools that are miles apart from each other are making use of videoconferencing
8787944 staff use it for professional development so they no longer have to drive long distances for training after school hours students can go on virtual field trips because were in northern ireland its not easy to get to places like the imperial war museum in london or the great barrier reef in australia students are able to partake in interactive sessions with other students and other teachers in other schools
8787945 the system has a wide range of endpoints from laptops to whiteboards
8787946 because its on the internet you can send lots of information across it and we can have up to 20 other locations on a single call we can communicate with schools we have relationships with in germany spain and chile some of whom only have webcams on desktop computers
8787947 there are 154 c2k computers in this school we purchased an additional 100 computers from c2k with our own funds and we also purchased a further 150 non c2k machines from our own funds with every teacher equipped with a laptop we have somewhere in the region of 550 computers the majority of which are under 18 months old
8787948 its essentially us being careful with money careful effective and efficient spending has allowed us to do what we have we had to be strategic and we had to demonstrate vision other schools havent spent as wisely
8787949 the most important piece in all of this is the students they are out and about in their spare time looking at the latest incredible internet technologies and all too often they say i did this four years ago the challenge for us is to keep pace with students but were not under any illusions well never entirely keep pace with them going forward talking with companies like microsoft hp and google will be very important because they are the companies whose technologies students are constantly accessing our job will be teaching in an efficient and comfortable learning environment
8787950 a whole generation has grown up with c2k in primary and post primary in the case of post primary some like grosvenor have gone on and enhanced provision and are exploiting c2k fully all of them are taking advantage of what is provided and pupils have an expectation of good technology being made available

8787956 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005
8787957 it appears that low income senior and disabled new yorkers who own their own homes will likely freeze to death this winter unless some real and immediate relief is offered
8787958 if anyone provides a service that person or entity is allowed to get compensated

8787963 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8787964 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8787965 mrs cavinee i dont know how you have been walking arent you in pain

8787967 and he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me i am his own and the joy we share as we tarry there none other has ever known

8787989 our luck will turn it is just a matter of time
8787990 we have not score anywhere near as many goals as our possession warranted
8787991 we have to create more but if we keep playing the way we are then the goals will come we have three or four good strikers and quite a few midfielders who love scoring goals
8787992 we are a better team this season and someone will be on the end of a hammering soon
8787993 i dont read the papers as far as im concerned i just get on with my job i speak to patrick on a daily basis and have definitely not been given that ultimatium
8787994 we are a better team than we were last season but our results are not showing that at the moment we have to turn that around with a win on saturday
8787995 obviously its good for every attacking player at arsenal because of the way in which they play the game
8787996 when i first came here last season the manager told me that he wanted to try to play the same way but we had a lot of injuries last year and it wasnt easy
8787997 this year its been better and we are trying to play our football its great for me because i like to attack and if everybody stays fit i think we can go on and have a good season
8787998 its great to be a part of the team at the moment so i dont mind where the manager asks me to play

8788010 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
8788011 tonight i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough
8788012 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8788013 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8788014 so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8788015 now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world class education because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy and i will not settle for an america where some kids dont have that chance ill invest in early childhood education ill recruit an army of new teachers and pay them higher salaries and give them more support and in exchange ill ask for higher standards and more accountability
8788016 and now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal days work because i want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons
8788017 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow
8788018 we must also admit that fulfilling americas promise will require more than just money
8788019 intellectual and moral strength individual responsibility and mutual responsibility thats the essence of americas promise
8788020 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8788021 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives

8788023 what i will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8788024 if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from you make a big election about small things
8788025 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8788026 and it is that promise that 45 years ago today brought americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington before lincolns memorial and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream we cannot walk alone

8788030 people are buying this baseball betting stuff like hotcakes im thrilled about the success of these products
8788031 im really impressed by the presentation carolann falcione did about up and coming baseball betting businesses the reasoning was solid plenty of detail was provided and some of the conclusions were very provocative
8788032 ive got double the usual number of orders since the conferenced started this means our company will probably have a surplus at the end of the year and will allow us to continue strong into the next quarter
8788033 and eventually i want to start my own baseball betting business that will parallel my work in hollywood
8788034 i like the idea of having a baseball betting conference in our town but cant sleep at night with all them creating a rucus
8788035 it wasnt so bad last year but last night i didnt get to bed until 3 am with all the shananigans going on
8788036 they were saying that even though we got santana it wasnt going to be enough
8788037 at the time i kept saying i thought getting santana put a front line starter on the staff when we started the year i felt we had duque martinez maine and perez we thought pelfrey would start as a long man in the bullpen i felt he would develop into a starter but he had to develop wed have to wait for him i thought somewhere in the second half of the season
8788038 a lot has to do with confidence with these young guys
8788039 it gets down to him trusting his best pitch which is a hard sinker once they get to the major leagues they feel they have to find ways to get guys out with their best pitch hes sticking with his strength right now
8788040 the schedule works in our favor because we have a couple days off
8788041 when a guy is having success you want to keep him there
8788042 you want to have guys who if they fail are not afraid to go back out there you dont want guys who are afraid to pitch in a pennant race ayala didnt have a good record with the nationals but numbers can be deceiving he pitched in the eighth inning with a lead 30 some times and held the lead

8788080 quello di sapere ispirare la gente infondere la speranza guidarla verso un orizzonte pi alto ha lintelligenza e la curiosit che non possono mancare in un presidente ha mostrato di avere una chiara comprensione della politica estera delle sfide sul fronte della sicurezza nazionale e una ferma determinazione a rimettere in sesto le nostre forze armate

8788087 un uomo integro capace di trascinare lamerica e di restituire speranza
8788088 io e barack siamo stati educati con gli stessi valori ha ricordato che devi lavorare sodo per ottenere ci che vuoi nella vita che la parola data un vincolo che se prometti qualcosa lo dovrai mantenere e che devi trattare ogni persona con dignit e rispetto anche se non sei daccordo con loro
8788089 e rimasto lo stesso uomo di cui mi innamorai 19 anni fa luomo che quando mi ha portato a casa dallospedale insieme alla nostra prima figlia guidava a passo di lumaca guardando con ansia nello specchietto retrovisore sentendo per intero il peso del nostro futuro nelle sue mani e deciso a dare alla nostra bimba tutto ci per cui aveva lottato e quello che lui non aveva mai avuto labbraccio rassicurante di un padre

8788106 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
8788107 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
8788108 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
8788109 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza

8788133 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8788134 senator mccain likes to talk about judgement but really what does it say about your judgement when you think george bush was right more than 90 of the time
8788135 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 chance on change
8788136 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first

8788152 it was difficult we applied as much pressure as we could on fifa uefa and the georgian fa to get clarity as quickly as we could
8788153 the fans deserved to have clarity on this issue before they did
8788154 well be setting up a ticket operation along with the club in germany to try and make sure that whatever irish fans want to get into the game will get into the game
8788155 aerlingus com is advertising flights to frankfurt on its homepage for 35 and up until yesterday flights for the week of the match were available for 49

8788157 similarly ryanair has been offering 1 flights to frankfurt and a round trip including taxes and charges was available for 88 now the total cost of flying to frankfurt with the airline on the sixth and back on the seventh amounts to 298 44
8788158 rip off ireland is clearly alive and well and in this case it is irish fans whose enthusiasm for their national team is being exploited
8788159 you calling us is honestly the first we have heard of it prices are higher this weekend purely because there was a high demand
8788160 the number of tickets we get is at the behest of the georgian fa
8788161 the choice about putting bucket seats in the standing area to increase the capacity is also up to them
8788162 there would not be great scope for us to improve our final ballpark figures
8788163 we didnt make any offers but weve been trying to explore what ballpark might be able to find agreement
8788164 we indicated a 21 month agreement was the appropriate duration and a significant pay pause and a pay increase in low single digit figures
8788165 its very difficult to see what can be done to secure a deal as the economic situation is deteriorating by the week and i believe the government needs to get the social partners to a shared consensus of the problems confronting us and a shared consensus of the solutions
8788166 clearly economic policy pay policy and labour market policy are terribly important in the context of our competitiveness and productivity both of which have suffered
8788167 companies need to be able to get change more easily than in the past and need to be able to improve productivity and make cost off setting measures where necessary
8788168 we have received a number of queries in regard to purchases that have already been made and we will be answering all of those queries over the next 24 hours we ask for your patience and we will reply to you as soon as we can

8788177 he was a black man who grew up in a whie world
8788178 but it was his life experience that made him reach for the highest dream
8788179 he did the equivalent of the george bushs bring it on line and i think hes up to the task
8788180 i loved it when he said we need a government that puts barney smith in front of smith barney
8788181 to be part of this was absolutely amazing said romines who came to denver a
8788182 abortion gay marriage guns he touched on those things that help republicans win
8788183 ive been listening to him more and more and im a believer now
8788184 i used to think democrats were just a bunch of special interest groups but he makes you think of what we could be he inspires you to believe that things can really change you dont think of him as a democrat
8788185 talking to workers about health care about being able to take a day off because your kid is sick he said the things he needed to say and he was eloquent
8788186 i think he was respectful of mccain and yet pointed out the differences very clearly
8788187 i wanted to hear that i dont want this to degenerate into name calling
8788188 the thing about hosting this with so many people is that i didnt get to listen as closely as id like
8788189 but i think he had to explain what change meant if he was elected and he did that taxes iraq health care the economy he talked about the things that stress people out
8788190 i get it that he had 75 000 people there
8788191 they were people like me i wish id been there too

8788219 today i felt nervous at the beginning and then it went away
8788220 i am not thinking about anything right now just enjoying the moment
8788221 this is very disappointing to me but something i have to accept
8788222 she played a lot better than i expected she served very well
8788223 i did well i had to come back in third set from down 3 0 in games so i am happy with the victory
8788224 i am happy to be in the third round for me this is a very important tournament

8788228 people still are used to deflation and now theyre starting to see the prices of their daily necessities going up sharply
8788229 looking ahead the contribution from high energy prices should diminish
8788230 the fact is that us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders
8788231 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
8788232 those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8788233 i dont think theres anything to announce yet but i know that that is under discussion
8788234 it is time to establish the truth about the crimes committed before and during russias invasion of georgia
8788235 georgia continues the redeployment of its forces in the direction of south ossetia and the restoration of the combat capability of its troops
8788236 well if you guys like ichiro and matsui so much order them both ill eat anything

8788242 windows servers account for the single largest segment of spending by operating system in the worldwide server market
8788243 you know john mccain likes to say hell follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave in which he lives
8788244 i dont want to fear america i want to respect it
8788245 instead it is that american spirit that american promise that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain that binds us together in spite of our differences that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen but what is unseen that better place around the bend
8788246 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8788247 so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8788248 so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america

8788257 that gdp surprised on the upside the market wasnt expecting that easy forex senior dealer francisco solar said
8788258 there was some rebound in the us dollar coupled with oil dropping that added to the sell off in the aussie
8788259 this new business model means allco will be a fiduciary manager of investment funds in aviation shipping and private equity he said
8788260 we will cease our principal investment activities sell remaining non core assets and in the future only use the balance sheet to co invest in our managed funds
8788261 this new structure is a major departure from our previous operations in which the group was heavily reliant on debt and as a result was exposed to the global credit crisis and deteriorating financial markets mr clarke said
8788262 with its previous complex structure allco had entered some non core businesses that were dependent on the ongoing availability of corporate funding
8788263 they were either unprofitable in the new economic environment or required significant capital to achieve profitable scale he said
8788264 we have determined that capital is better deployed in our three core asset classes which fit our funds management model
8788265 unfortunately this has required the departure of many talented employees to date and will see a further reduction in headcount by up to 50 per cent by the end of june 2009 as we accelerate our restructuring program he said
8788266 the reconstruction of the group is progressing however the business remains in a fragile position and the continued market weakness is making the task difficult mr clarke said
8788267 we are committed to creating a leaner and simpler to understand company with realistic growth opportunities
8788268 we plan to continue to diversify and broaden our fleet with greater exposure to the growth segments particularly in high margin niche areas like lpg and offshore supply mr clarke said
8788269 collecting low hanging fruit is a knowledge management tactic not a legitimate strategy strategy sets your goals and gives you a reason for the projects you undertake and the methods you employ tactics are fine if they are deployed to advance an agreed strategy otherwise they are little better than busy work

8788274 i have never been contacted by the mccain campaign at any point about the vp slot
8788275 i have never been asked for any information background etc so as i have said repeatedly in interviews i didnt consider myself to be under any consideration
8788276 i think people thought i was being coy and just not talking but i have built my political life on trying to shoot straight and tell it as it is and as i see it
8788277 i have been honest in telling you that i had no reason to believe i was ever seriously considered or
8788278 i hope it will be a person with a solid record and solid convictions on the foundation issues that bring many of us to the process
8788279 im taking this unusual step to communicate so it will come from me and not from some of the ridiculous things being said on tv and websites tonight

8788281 if you dont know me by now you will never never know me
8788282 i get it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8788283 i believe that as hard as it will be the change we need is coming because ive seen it because ive lived it
8788284 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time
8788285 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8788286 as president of the united states i will cut taxes for 95 percent of working families
8788287 he says he will chase bin laden to the gates of hell but wont go to the cave were he lives
8788288 they will have more than 85 000 people perhaps more than 90 000 people in this stadium by the time barack obama speaks
8788289 there is a concern that the obama campaign may have issued as many as 20 000 more tickets for this event
8788290 for with what judgement you are judging you will be judged
8788291 if you dont quite understand what it is that obama offers this country if his past accomplishments dont give you a clue if youve not yet been able to distill from his speeches exactly what it is that we should
8788292 he has 300 foreign policy advisers and for his convention speech a football stadium equipped with a movie set that looks like a greek temple
8788293 he claims to be the one that we have been waiting for and he can lower the seas and promise and deliver universal love simply by showing up
8788294 why should anyone listen to the conservatives they overwhelmingly voted for the dumbest president on record
8788295 are they nominating a candidate or caesar the only thing thats missing is a laurel wreath
8788296 i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
8788297 party of the rich for the rich by the rich
8788298 and these people want us to turn over the security of the country to them
8788299 in closing mccain may have been a good soldier but hes no leader obamas a leader we will follow
8788300 i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
8788301 one top gop strategist told me privately that he thinks it will cost obama 4 6 points nationally
8788302 i get it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8788303 i decided i wont wear that pin on my chest
8788304 instead im going to try to tell the american people what i believe will make this country great and hopefully that will be a testament to my patriotism
8788305 the most powerful country in the world to the weakest
8788306 why do they dislike intelligence in this country in leaders
8788307 senator i knew abe lincoln abe lincoln was friend of mine senator youre no abe lincoln
8788308 so i have a solution to the health care crisis and it will cost not one thin dime
8788309 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care so there you have it voila problem solved
8788310 so instead of producing worthless statistics that people fling around in vacuous editorials and pointless debates the census bureau should produce meaningful numbers identifying all of the sources of funds people will draw on if they need medical care

8788314 even in its less than originally promised form the mccain
8788315 still obsessing over the privatization of the va for some reason john mccain is poised to lose the veterans vote for good in fact in response to his saturday speech to the dav iraq war veteran and double amputee tammy duckworth had this to say about mccains proposals
8788316 john mccain has said that improving veterans health care would be his top domestic priority as president yet he has repeatedly voted against increased funding for veterans health care and now he offers up an plastic card option that will lead to privatization of veterans health care no one knows how to help and heal veterans like veterans had i ended up in a regular hospital after returning from iraq i would lost my arm mccains plan will only hurt the va and our veterans more than they are already hurting

8788487 people involved in sport from countries where doping used to be routine like in russia and eastern bloc countries are still around and still working in sport as coaches and working closely with athletes it will take a generation to create doping free environments for athletes
8788488 its certainly true now is the time to strike when the iron is hot
8788489 athletics managers are quite different to football managers as well as maximizing their earning potential we also look after the day to day stuff like where he stays how he travels
8788490 but its important that i look after our other clients too put my arm round the ones that havent done so well and say hey next time
8788491 its been hectic after the events the athletes go through the mixer they go through drug testing and id have to accompany them through that and take them back to the village with usain theres a lot of media hype and everywhere he steps out theres 20 people who jump on him looking for autographs as well as meetings i have to take athletes to their sponsors

8788504 obamas speech was more substance than style more specifics than rhetorical flourish
8788505 it was a feel good speech it made you think about yourself and where you wanted the united states to go it was just him making you feel good for the purpose of him getting elected
8788506 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain barack obama is still not ready to be president
8788507 my god how did i get on this rocket ship
8788508 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8788509 i want to go home i want to be back in my country and be a part of this
8788510 we are very lucky to be americans i wish i was old enough to vote for obama
8788511 but that is a different battle and one that can wait until after november
8788512 america has just seen a misleading speech that is at odds with senator obamas meager
8788513 ive been criticized for saying he inspires me but to hell with my critics
8788514 well keith that was an interesting speech from sen mccain but it really paled in comparison to the one we saw last week
8788515 i have seen kennedy and i have seen reagan i have seen martin luther this was the greatest convention speech because this one was an acceptance speech this was the greatest this is my favorite passage i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america this is the kind of thing that grabs people by the heart that brings them to their feet and brings them together
8788516 and do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind so that you may prove what the will of god is that which is good and acceptable and perfect
8788517 let this mind be in you that was in christ jesus
8788518 the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed in us in heaven
8788519 a nd we know that god causes all emphasis added things to work for the good of those who love god to those who are called according to his purpose
8788520 in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us

8788527 like youd call someone and theyd think you were actually the refrigerator company
8788528 i dont think i can live on minimum wage anymore

8788531 or just not go to bed i could sleep when i got home from work heres a courtesy clerk position im going to apply for that
8788532 its like a bagboy they want to know how much i want to make what should i put
8788533 i think if you put twelve they would not call you because of it but i dont think theyd do that for ten
8788534 o kay ive brought you both here at once so you can tell me and each other why youre right to be our courtesy clerk o kay
8788535 o kay so megan you put on your application that youd like to make ten dollars an hour and ashley you said seven could you each tell me a little more about that
8788536 i said ten because id like to make ten isnt seven below minimum wage

8788540 i uh wow really i once remade a mans beverage four times in the end he was satisfied and he gave a big tip
8788541 ive been impressed with how sharp he has looked in his first two starts
8788542 he is getting the ball out on time and even looks likes he has more zip on his passes
8788543 he makes sure that they are comfortable in the pocket and set them up for big plays in the passing game if the quarterback is a good decision maker he can be very productive in that offense
8788544 he is at his best when he is able to throw off play action and the dolphins threat of a running game should give him plenty of chances to connect on deeper throws
8788545 defenses have not been bringing pressure so he has been able to get comfortable in the pocket it will be interesting to see how he performs when defensive coordinators start coming after him
8788546 it makes me believe that merrimans injury is serious or that the team is preparing to move on when his contract ends

8788575 it is not in the stars to hold our destiny but in ourselves
8788576 the world is not respectable it is mortal tormented confused deluded forever but it is shot through with beauty love and glints of courage and laughter and in these the spirit blooms timidly and struggles to the light amid the thorns
8788577 dream lofty dreams and as you dream so you shall become your vision is the promise of what you shall one day be your ideal is the prophecy of what you shall at last unveil

8788583 due to greater population infrastructure and wealth on the u s coastlines and not to any spike in the number or intensity of hurricanes
8788584 longer growing seasons shorter winters reduced energy requirements and forests growing in areas that are now just tundra

8788657 sorry we are experiencing high call volume please call back
8788658 good afternoon this is marla schaeffer reporting live from the national broadcasting desk with breaking news
8788659 we have just learned from a number of reliable government sources of a reported underground government run medical operation an operation that targets newborn infants for genetic testing to determine the medical traits they will develop as adults
8788660 the primary group targeted by the project have been newborns testing positive for genes that would eventually cause psychiatric disorders and terminal illnesses requiring long term and sometimes costly care later in life apparently the project was created as a last ditch effort to combat what are now out of control health care costs for our nations chronically and terminally ill citizens
8788661 any hospital that did not cooperate with the the obstetric protocol was immediately shut down and ordered to cite bankruptcy from rising hmo costs as the reason
8788662 you may recall that we were also the first to break the story of well known facilities such as mass
8788663 our sources have also detailed the way in which the newborns with eliminating traits were disposed of by the government and replaced with healthy babies
8788664 ive just been told that we have our first live interview with one of our sources on the inside of this alarming scientific scandal
8788665 maam i understand that you played a crucial role in this genetics project that was just uncovered can you tell us your name and job title
8788666 i was responsible for overseeing the elimination of all unfit specimens containing potential viruses um infants testing positive for eliminating genetic traits
8788667 and what made you decide to come forward with the information that you and your colleagues who chose to remain anonymous shared with our reporters today
8788668 i couldnt be a part of this any longer no one should have to do what i what we had to do they were innocent babies
8788669 ms holmes can you tell us approximately how many babies have been murdered in the twenty years since the project began
8788670 our country was created on a foundation of democracy and freedom by a government of the people and for the people
8788671 so what youre saying cardinal is that the chronology of events and their nature in the genetics project nearly imitate the early persecution of the jews to the letter
8788672 word from the oval office this hour is that there will be no further word thats right after apparently issuing the order to military special forces to restore order in all rioting cities at any cost the white house press office has engaged in a news blackout
8788673 th the nation can now only sit back and wonder what this administration is planning to do to end what is now being called s second civil war
8788674 brothers this is what we and our fallen comrades before us have been training for since 1965 our founders had the foresight to predict that this day would come the day when the most democratic nation in the world would turn on its citizens and impose anarchy
8788675 our former government is guilty of the slaughtering of its people withholding information and conspiracy their citizens have voiced their opposition in accordance with their first amendment rights and yet the traitors to the constitution strike back at them with violence destruction and more killing
8788676 this is what you have been training your troops for this is what our founding brothers predicted would happen and therefore we are ready
8788677 50 regional armies of approximately 10 000 trained comrades a piece totals an army of 500 000 comrades prepared to restore liberty justice and democracy to these our nations leaders have strayed from the path drawn for them by their forefathers and as patriots it is our job to bring them back
8788678 heres our status men through their actions our former government has declared the u s constitution void and i hereby appoint the brothers of patriotism as the new cabinet elect of the you will all be sworn in at the conclusion of this meeting
8788679 in each of the hot regions the citizens are in great and immediate danger of being overthrown by the former government
8788680 genuine religion is a kind of absolute defense against bad ideologies from the violent aggression of nazism to the passive aggressiveness of blind obamism conversely virtually all bad ideologies the ones that do real damage become pseudo religions drawing on religious energy and emotion in the absence of religion
8788681 police yeah the guy at the u haul counter laughed at me again
8788682 she was all butt hurt when he started being a bit of a dickbag to her at work
8788683 you cant fool all of the people all of the time
8788684 we in this country are perilously close to the end the concluding event of a long line of corrections at gods hand will be nuclear destruction
8788685 we will get there because we live here only in america randi only in america
8788686 before he entered the white house abraham lincolns experience in elective office consisted of eight years in his state legislature in springfield ill
8788687 the experience lincolns supporters valued most in that race was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
8788688 he was known chiefly as a clear thinker and a great orator with a passion for justice and a determination to heal the deep divisions of our land he insisted on reaching past partisan and regional divides to exalt our common humanity in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
8788689 whatever else history may say about me when im gone i hope it will record that i appealed to your best hopes not your worst fears to your confidence rather than your doubts my dream is that you will travel the road ahead with libertys lamp guiding your steps and opportunitys arm steadying your way
8788690 i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal
8788691 i cant possibly keep losing like this if i double the last bet ill get it back i can double my bet a few times as necessary until i hit then i can back down and start over
8788692 i am crying because i dont want to move anymore let me stay here
8788693 they want more troops in afghanistan they want to send more support to georgia to protect the oil line there neither one says bring home the troops from iraq from the bases you know the bases are going to stay there the embassy as big as the vatican thats going to remain so their foreign policies are exactly the same
8788694 we create the threats why are we on the borders of russia provoking the russians i mean the georgians initiated the military attack against these enclaves where there were mostly russians its a fact that were over there that we create these crises
8788695 we in this country are perilously close to the end the concluding event of a long line of corrections at gods hand will be nuclear destruction
8788696 did you know that one out of three children reports being bullied in school

8788711 reference to the event starts with a declaration of anger with the tyrants
8788712 the perpetrators aroused gods wrath for the evil crime they committed
8788713 the believers had not committed any crime or evil deed against them
8788714 the narration of the event is completed in a few short verses which charge our hearts with a feeling of repugnance towards the terrible crime and its evil perpetrators
8788715 as the narration of the event concludes we feel overwhelmed by the magnificence of faith as it exalts the believers and attains its triumph over all hardships and indeed over life itself
8788716 with this conclusion justice is restored and the whole question is finally resolved what has taken place on earth is no more than one part the matter remains unfinished here this is the fact emphasized by this initial comment on the pit event so that it may be fully comprehended by the few believers who have accepted the faith in makkah and by every group of believers subjected to trial and tyranny during any period of history
8788717 you cant simply have in my own judgment creation simply being a random event because it is so inherently ordered and the fact that the natural environment is being ordered where it can properly coexist over time
8788718 donation from the nabari no ou fans to pay the workers
8788719 theres no place id rather be than here with you guys right now
8788720 that was the day i fell in love with him and im still in love with him
8788721 he suffered a fatal embolism that would eventually take his life
8788722 but he had the hardest time loving himself and that was the most difficult thing about being his friend for me watching him torture himself
8788723 good soul but he was a tortured soul but he loved his family and he loved his friends
8788724 and it was shining more than it had for a very long time
8788725 and her willingness to stand in front of him as he was reluctant to love himself and insisted on it caused him to eventually see the light
8788726 that we could all see it so much all of the time when he would put that horn in his mouth and make the most astonishingly honest music that could knock you over and it would sink right to the middle of you
8788727 he was standing right there and im not sure if i saw him fall asleep but i definitely saw him wake up
8788728 he also fell asleep next to me in his old blue volkswagen station wagon driving down 64 once
8788729 he could have done that for a living though it may not have been as lucrative
8788730 he told them with an honesty the same way he played
8788731 i would tell him jokes just so i could hear him tell them after me
8788732 leroi would engage me in animated conversation whenever i would encounter him at home or at church
8788733 more often than not he felt that the music in the episcopal church left a lot to be desired
8788734 i stood up to leave and he said hang on a sec
8788735 he was in his wheelchair and he took the better part of three or four minutes to get his wheels locked and he wouldnt let me leave until he stood up
8788736 34 from dmbs major label debut under the table and dreaming
8788737 like all great musicians he had great timing and a great ear
8788738 when you heard that piece from his teacher you couldnt help but think of that
8788739 when dave was talking about how he always falls asleep
8788740 que sera presentada muy pronto entre sus caracter sticas est n
8788741 will you shut the fuck up thats what im thinking
8788742 youve got to make love to me this very moment
8788743 one who is the property of and entirely subject to another person whether by capture purchase or birth a servant completely divested of freedom and personal rights
8788744 if you were a true submisssive you would do it
8788745 i wonder why i waste my time with you when you do this
8788746 and when this inevitable transformation completes all the photoshoping in the world aint gonna cover up that neck
8788747 she and kiss stop posting about yourselves those two bitches are the biggest narcissists imaginable
8788748 an end time army has one common purpose to aggressively take ground for the kingdom of god under the authority of jesus christ the dread champion
8788749 the trumpet is sounding calling on fire revolutionary believers to enlist in joels army many are now ready to be mobilized to establish and advance gods kingdom on earth
8788750 the pitch and intensity of the military rhetoric of this branch of the global dominionist movement has substantially increased since the beginning of 2008
8788751 one can only wonder how long before this transforms into real warfare with actual warriors
8788752 get busy in constructing a bible based social political and religious order which finally denies the religious liberty of the enemies of god
8788753 such leaders prefer more authoritarian structures where their own word or decrees are unchallenged
8788754 as the church begins to take on this resolve they joels army churches will start to be thought of more as military bases and they will begin to take on the characteristics of military bases for training equipping and deploying effective spiritual forces
8788755 in time the church will actually be organized more as a military force with an army navy air force etc
8788756 some pastors and leaders who continue to resist this tide of unity will be removed from their place some will become so hardened they will become opposers and resist god to the end
8788757 i am thinking god why is the power of god not moving
8788758 i believe were headed to an elijah jezebel showdown on the earth not just in america but all over the globe and the main warriors will be the prophets of baal versus the prophets of god and there will be no middle ground
8788759 theres an elijah generation thats going to be the forerunners for the coming of jesus a generation marked not by their niceness but by the intensity of their passion
8788760 the kingdom of heaven suffers violence and the violent take it by force such force demands an equal response and jesus is going to make war on everything that hinders love with his eyes blazing fire
8788761 a lot of people die for god and theyre not afraid
8788762 like dawn spreading across the mountains a large and mighty army comes such as never was of old nor ever will be in ages to come
8788763 it is a complete misinterpretation of scripture to find in joels army of locusts a militant victorious force attacking society and a non cooperating church to prepare the earth for christs millennial reign
8788764 through cain came all the smart educated people down to the antediluvian flood the intellectuals bible colleges
8788765 they know all their creeds but know nothing about god
8788766 a super race mentality toward the training of their children
8788767 today you can type joels army into a search engine and a thousand heresy hunter websites pop up decrying the very mention of it
8788768 this battle is not a game they joels army warriors will not be on the defense they will be on the offense and the gates of hell will not be able to hold up against them
8788769 those in this army will have his kind of power anyone who wants to harm them must die
8788770 but this is not accurate innocent christians mostly of dalit origin continue to be attacked by communal organizations which are mocking the rule of law
8788771 we call for all church and christian educational institutions of catholic protestant independent and unaffiliated christian denominations in the service of society to close for one day
8788772 we hope parents become aware of the implications of the incidents in orissa
8788773 we also request all our people to pray for the victims of violence in orissa and other places and their near and dear ones we also pray for the misguided perpetrators of violence that they may mend their ways and become responsible citizens

8788882 holds states and school districts accountable for progress and rewards them for results
8788883 we oppose amnesty the rule of law suffers if government policies encourage or reward illegal activity
8788884 the american peoples rejection of en masse legalizations is especially appropriate given the federal governments past failures to enforce the law

8788886 union negotiated pension schemes consistently maintain dangerously low ratios of assets to liabilities
8788887 although nearly 90 percent of non union funds had at least 80 percent of the funds they need only 60 percent of union plans were at or above that mark
8788888 the success of the officers funds shows the heads of the national organization know how to properly fund a pension plan if they choose to
8788889 im the dude playing a dude disguised as another dude
8788890 check it out dustin hoffman rain man look retarded act retarded not retarded count toothpicks to your cards autistic sure not retarded you know tom hanks forrest gump slow yes retarded maybe braces on his legs but he charmed the pants off nixon and won a ping pong competition that aint retarded you went full retard man never go full retard
8788891 there were times while i was playing jack where i felt retarded like really retarded
8788892 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8788893 this is an attempt to try to put into words that this is an area that we cherish
8788894 its a very important part of the community and we need to do our best to protect it
8788895 we came to realize with a collective shock that there was no protection for this land whatsoever said commission member lucille crow
8788896 we didnt want another council saying it would be nice to put a big hotel down there on the waterfront said fellow member mary jo fulkerson
8788897 i just wanted it protected period end of subject crow said
8788898 the commons and port of excelsior are to be preserved as parkland in perpetuity this land shall not be sold and cannot be developed or leased except for city sponsored parkland uses
8788899 nobody is really sure what the word city sponsored means
8788900 doesnt preclude a pavilion from happening because the city could sponsor construction of a pavilion his view is that the city should consider development on the site that would help excelsior meet its future financial needs
8788901 i believe the city council of excelsior should retain the authority to do what they want to do with any of the property that is controlled by the city
8788902 i feel that no matter how clear we make it the people who have a vested interest in the pavilion are going to try everything they can think of to make it sound like a bad amendment because they dont want it to go through brokaw said
8788903 one of the dilemmas you get caught in here is that in these economic times demand for services is going up
8788904 we have pretty substantial changes to make here but were a big county we have a big budget and were financially stable its about how do we change what we do now to make it better or how do we decide not to do some things in the future that we do now
8788905 i dont want budget cuts put on the backs of child protection workers
8788906 in child protection we better know what we need to do because children will pay
8788907 for the lack of a better word waste around here people who are just staying and staying and staying
8788908 we cant just say we have a lot of dead wood out there i dont think we know that
8788909 its a complicated system and id like us to assess that so we can say with some confidence whether that is true
8788910 isnt any fat in this organization in any organization this size there clearly is some
8788911 i dont think its a big piece of this budget
8788912 i think this is the first time i have ever seen a memorial race for a fan
8788913 jim wasnt only a fan of mine he was a fan of racing

8788917 we just dont know how were going to get there you just have to pull out your credit card and hope you can pay at the end of the day
8788918 we deeply regret the fact that we have been forced to cease all zoom operations
8788919 it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff
8788920 even as late as lunchtime today thursday we believed we had secured a new investment package to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying
8788921 having been unable to complete the investment package the directors of zoom had no option but to instigate insolvency administration proceedings
8788922 these are things that were going to work through and if we find passengers in difficult circumstances everybodys going to have to work together to deal with that
8788923 our discussions with zoom today led us to take this action
8788924 we will just continue our discussion with zoom over the next while to attempt to get this outstanding debt resolved
8788925 zoom was trying to get into a market that didnt exist really

8788927 sea ice extent has fallen below the 2005 minimum previously the second lowest extent recorded since the dawn of the satellite era will 2008 also break the standing record low set in 2007 we will know in the next several weeks when the melt season comes to a close the bottom line however is that the strong negative trend in summertime ice extent characterizing the past decade continues
8788928 i find it extremely troubling that a parent would say the things he wrote in those messages
8788929 let us close ranks and jack up this executioner on our horns
8788930 if you please in what way is the butcher any worse than the dealer who drove us hither with his cudgel
8788931 but we shall be able to attend to the dealer as well afterwards
8788932 you are trying from the left to shield our enemies you are a social butcher yourself
8788933 nine tenths of wisdom consists in being wise in time
8788934 why does the story mention two black men a black police officer and two white police officers is not the story the same if race is not mentioned was race part of the issue that led to assault or arrest as someone with 30 years of law enforcement experience i do not get it i thought stories like these were written in the 1950s and 1960s
8788935 id put my money on the sun and solar energy what a source of power
8788936 i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that

8788940 connected to each other without alleyways dialogs or a lot of interaction
8788941 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8788942 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8788943 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8788944 we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are here to restore that legacy
8788945 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
8788946 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8788947 these are the policies i will pursue and in the weeks ahead i look forward to debating them with john mccain
8788948 but what i will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
8788949 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook so let us agree that patriotism has no party
8788950 i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
8788951 we cannot walk alone the preacher cried and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8788952 weve come a long way but we still have a distance to go weve come a long way but we must march again on nov 4 we must march in every state in every city in every village in every hamlet we must march to the ballot box we must march like we have never marched before to elect the next president of the united states sen barack obama
8788953 senator obama this is truly a good day for america too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8788954 im howard dean chairman of the democratic national committee i know exactly how many houses i own
8788955 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8788956 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000
8788957 john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies all over again
8788958 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8788959 ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8788960 were here for the millions of americans who have been knocked down to send a message together to send a message that were going to get back up as a nation
8788961 the experience lincolns supporters valued most in that race was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
8788962 in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch see photos from around denver on the fourth and final day of the democratic national convention another new beginning and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition

8788970 i think we should bring the latest science into any decision
8788971 however ambitious we are with climate legislation we cant make european companies uncompetitive in the global market particularly high energy users
8788972 this could potentially fatally undermine an automatic move to a 30 percent cut in emissions

8788978 if you were to go down parmer or 183 you see people speeding
8788979 i think the urban legend out there is that someone can drive 10 miles over the limit and not be pulled over
8788980 our main goal is just compliance with speed and unfortunately sometimes the only way we can get compliance is through citations
8788981 i am far within the mark when i say that all the armies that ever marched and all the navies that ever sailed and all the parliaments that ever sat and all the kings that ever reigned put together have not affected the life of man upon this earth as has that one solitary life
8788982 theyve taken the last two weeks to fabricate a set of steel flotation pontoons which make it a lot easier and safer to tow
8788983 chief justice williams firmly believes that mediation and negotiation can produce a far better resolution for the parties and for the citizens of the state than any court decision
8788984 you can be sure that after the arbitrators award is in if it reaches that there will be further litigation by one side or the other thats the american way
8788985 precisely the kind of abuse of executive power that our system of government was designed to prevent
8788986 the idea behind this whole process was to reach a contract
8788987 were going to do our best efforts to negotiate and discuss this in good faith and get a resolution
8788988 and the chief justice is going to be watching carefully over this process he has encouraged both sides to get together and to get a deal for the benefit of the people of rhode island
8788989 represents the very best financial offer the state can afford in this economic climate
8788990 while i am hopeful this expedited process will result in a ratified agreement i continue to have an obligation to balance the budget the longer we are without an agreement with council 94 and the other unions the only options i have to recoup the cost savings are more severe and impactful to employees than the co share changes time is running out i cannot delay much longer
8788991 you have to understand though that the state workforce is down to a level now that there arent enough people to do half the jobs that are out there
8788992 beautiful one room schoolhouse with eight grades it was absolutely marvelous
8788993 was in view of the state house and was a beautiful old building and it broke my heart when it was torn down to build providence place mall ive never been to that mall and i dont intend to
8788994 and we stayed right here and took care of the farm
8788995 please do not sell out the safety of your children
8788996 my job is not just getting on and off the bus
8788997 the union members would like to know how the school committee justifies the claim of a 300 000 savings to sell out their employees to first student we have accurate calculations that bring the cost of privatizing the special education bus assistants to 475 335 minimally for the 2008 09 school year
8788998 the cost to keep the buses in house including salaries pension payments health care and longevity is 541 131 that is a difference of 65 796 not 300 000
8788999 first we truly appreciate your services but we are in dire straits financially and that was the only reason

8789025 seans always been a leader even when he faced some adversity last year
8789026 he did go through some ups and downs but that is what made him what he is
8789027 i am still working to improve every day i am still not as good as i think i can be but i think i had a solid camp ive made pretty good decisions took care of the ball and helped move the offense i am excited to go out there and get it started
8789028 ive always took the approach that it is my team
8789029 its my last year ive been a quarterback here for three years so i have to have that mentality
8789030 when you talk about sean glennon we know he is not going to make a lot of mistakes
8789031 i dont really have any personal goals other than have a high completion percentage and take care of the ball
8789032 the most important thing is getting first downs and leading our team down field and put points on the board and win as many games as possible i want to win 10 games i want to get back to the acc championship and i want to get back to a bcs game
8789033 i have a great deal of confidence in myself and this team
8789034 i think the rest of the team has confidence in me so my leadership role just kind of comes naturally i am not a huge talker i just try to lead by example and i hope its rubbed off on the younger guys
8789035 those are guys that i have been throwing to for four years and ive had a lot of success with them obviously they are pretty good because they are playing on sundays in the nfl
8789036 i have to do everything i can to build chemistry and get these young guys going
8789037 i think once they get the mental aspects of the game they will be really good players
8789038 the csi labworkers dont spend any time on data analysis either they just throw a q tip with some skin cells in an eppendorf tube add liquid spin it down and the printer will spit out a two page report that literally tells you that the suspect or victim had maybelline mascara on her hands including batch number and colour

8789040 we found that good preschools offer learning opportunities over and above what most homes can provide
8789041 childrens ability to work independently improves significantly and thats a high predictor of future academic success
8789042 we do not know whether the effectiveness of the particular preschools was real or just a function of family factors
8789043 for a typical child with average ability going to a high quality preschool would improve their math scores by about 27 relative to the rest of the class

8789052 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive obama planned to say
8789053 because next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
8789054 i have a question for you he said during a warm up speech for sen
8789055 look charles i gotta do this if i dont ill be nothing ill end up like my neighbor ricky smith he just sits around crocheting all day and snorting nasal spray

8789063 you see democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country obama told an open air crowd of 75 000 excited democrats at denvers mile high stadium
8789064 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage he said
8789065 whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8789066 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off and look after a sick child without losing her job
8789067 baby seat laws did park dedications and hand out little league trophies to children that is what
8789068 it was phenomenal the way she gave her support barack obama
8789069 there was no bomb threat at santa teresa high school
8789070 as incredibly dangerous and risky thats one of the reasons our police department takes these cases seriously
8789071 the perception sometimes is that prostitution is harmless but there are
8789072 the fact that this guy is going to jail for walking dogs i think it highlights the lack of proportionality of this prosecution this case
8789073 it shouldnt be a criminal case this isnt someone who did anything purposely to any animal or person
8789074 i think what happened is theres a couple dogs that are still up there and theyre his dogs
8789075 i think hes put in the tough position he had the option of neglecting them or making sure those two dogs that were left were cared for
8789076 despite animal services and sheriffs offices numerous attempts they have been unable to locate him

8789150 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8789151 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8789152 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8789153 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8789154 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8789155 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8789156 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8789157 if john mccain wants to follow george bush with more tough talk and bad strategy that is his choice but it is not the change american needs
8789158 i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8789159 a clean break from the politics of partisanship and bitter division
8789160 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations
8789161 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8789162 a young man who isnt a socialist hasnt got a heart an old man who is a socialist hasnt got a head
8789163 these movements are made very rapidly within about 200 milliseconds but within that time the animal determines where the threat is coming from and activates an appropriate set of movements to position its legs and wings
8789164 this illustrates how rapidly the flys brain can process sensory information into an appropriate motor response
8789165 it is best not to swat at the flys starting position
8789166 unless you can show us proof or a reference similar to the kind one would cite in a trade journal or research paper dont show us the material in the first place
8789167 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not barack obama can bring democrats and republicans together our work will not be easy the challenges we face require tough choices and democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the worn out ideas and politics of the past
8789168 you think about everything from campaign finance to immigration and on and theres john mccain working across party lines senator obama doesnt have a record now he can make the claim and he can hold himself up as pure and trying to reach to a new generation of post partisan politics but he has to do so largely based on rhetoric and wishful thinking because he doesnt have the record
8789169 there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically
8789170 obama might have a similar bottom line core principles for which in some sense he is willing to die if so we dont know what they are nothing so far in his life approaches mccains decision to refuse repatriation as a pow so as to deny his jailors a propaganda coup in fact there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically thats why his reversal on campaign financing and his transparently false justification of it matter more than similar acts by mccain
8789171 his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
8789172 for a couple of days theyve been saying you voted to raise taxes something like 94 times that seems to be the drumbeat thats going to happen during this campaign are you going to raise taxes in a big way for average americans
8789173 i mean this is the standard fare of politics and
8789174 finally the obama people are too convinced that they can define mccain as bush iii the case is just factually inaccurate mccain will be able to pull out dozens of instances from torture to global warming to spending in which he broke with his party as rush limbaugh will tell you
8789175 as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his
8789176 he said that our economy has made great progress under this president he said that the fundamentals of the e conomy are strong
8789177 the second and third quotes the obama campaign uses from mccain are more misleading the ad shows mccain saying t heres been great progress economically the quote comes from an interview mccain did with peter cook at bloomberg television in april mccain was making a case for what he believed were positive economic developments during bushs time in office however the fuller quote shows mccain was saying that whatever progress had been made it wouldnt be enough to comfort families facing these tremendous economic challenges his comments overall are pessimistic he cites challenging times and enormous difficulties the obama campaign distorts his views by using just a snippet of his remarks
8789178 im going to ask you a version of the ronald reagan question you think if americans were asked are you better off today than you were before george bush took office more than seven years ago what answer would they give
8789179 i think if you look at the overall record and millions of jobs have been created et cetera et cetera yo u could make an argument that theres been great progress economically over that period of time but thats no comfort thats no comfort to families now that are facing these tremendous economic challenges but let me just add peter the fundamentals of americas economy are strong were the greatest exporter the greatest importer the greatest innovator the greatest producer still the greatest economic engine in the world and by the way exports and free trade are a key element in economic recovery but these are tough times tough times and nobody knows that more than american families including in small towns of pennsylvania they havent lost their fundamental religious beliefs their respect for the constitution their right to bear arms they are still keep america as a beacon of hope and freedom throughout the world
8789180 he knows how to twist with the best of them
8789181 i do not make a promise that we can reduce the budget deficit by 2013
8789182 i do not make a promise that we can reduce it by 2013 because i think it is important for us to make some critical investments right now in americas families obama told reporters this week when asked if hed match mccains pledge
8789183 since winning the nomination obama reportedly has been moving toward the middle of the political spectrum but on the budget he still sounds left of center with no interest in eliminating deficit spending
8789184 frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years
8789185 barack obama says john mccains plan to balance the budget doesnt add up easy for him to say its not a goal hes even trying to reach not only does obama say he wont eliminate the deficit in his first term as mccain aims to do he frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years considering his own spending plans
8789186 obama has rhetorically committed to a pay as you go approach by offsetting new spending and tax cuts with new taxes or spending cuts but his proposals do not come close to meeting this standard
8789187 has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of
8789188 the obama campaign responds that tax cuts once enacted are usually renewed and do not expire therefore they say obama can legitimately claim to be recouping money for other purposes by scaling back the tax cuts obama has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of what he wants to do
8789189 both obama and clinton promised to not raise taxes on those making less than 200 000 or 250 000 a year they both just emasculated their domestic programs returning the rich to their clinton era tax rates will yield at best 40 billion a year in revenue its impossible to fund a health care plan let alone anything else with that kind of money the consequences are clear if elected they will have to break their pledge and thus destroy their credibility or run a minimalist administration
8789190 the latest additions to sen barack obamas energy plan outlined during an appearance in lansing monday may win the democratic presidential candidate some votes from disgruntled consumers in november but theyll do nothing to answer the nations long term needs
8789191 when his presumptive republican opponent sen john mccain r ariz proposed a gas tax holiday as a way to reduce the high cost of driving mr obama showed political courage and intellectual honesty by refusing to sign on to that obvious gimmick its an idea to get them through an election mr obama said now he has two such gimmicks of his own
8789192 the politics may have changed but the facts havent the accuracy of sen mccains original position has not changed offshore drilling would not lower gas prices today it would not lower gas prices next year and it would not lower gas prices five years from now
8789193 i think john mccains proposal for a three month tax holiday is a bad idea
8789194 in this campaign john mccain is offering the same old gimmicks that will provide almost no short term relief to folks who are struggling with high gas prices gimmicks that will only increase our addiction for another four years
8789195 that might make sense in washington but it doesnt make sense for america in fact it makes about as much sense as his proposal to build 45 new nuclear reactors without a plan to store the waste some place other than guess where right here in nevada at yucca mountain
8789196 democratic presidential candidate barack obamas proposal for a windfall profits tax on oil companies could cost 15 billion a year at last years profit levels a campaign adviser said
8789197 obama may levy 15 billion tax on oil company profit
8789198 but to add a five year tax increase on top of that to pay for a one year gift to voters would indeed increase the cost of doing business that cost would be passed along in forgone investment in new production lower dividends for pension funds and other shareholders and higher prices at the pump thus socking it to the consumers whom the plan is supposed to help if oil prices fall there might be no windfall profits to tax then the obama rebate would have to be paid for through spending cuts taxes on something else or borrowing
8789199 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families
8789200 what obama voted for was a budget resolution that would have allowed most of the provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to expire in particular the resolution would allow the 25 percent tax bracket to return to its pre 2001 level of 28 percent that bracket kicks in at 32 550 for an individual or 65 100 for a married couple but as those of you who have filled out a 1040 know thats not actually how income taxes work we dont pay taxes on our total earnings we pay them based on our taxable income the urban brookings tax policy centers eric toder told factcheck org that people with taxable income of 32 000 would have a total income greater than that in 2008 anyone filing taxes with single status would be entitled to a standar d deduction of 5 450 as well as a personal exemption of 3 500 so to have a taxable income high enough to reach the 25 percent bracket an individual would need to earn at least 41 500 in total income while a married couple would need a combined income of at least 83 000
8789201 certainly obamas votes indicate a willingness to raise taxes and obama has not been shy about saying explicitly that he will raise some taxes
8789202 campaign aides to senator obama today called the charge that he voted for tax hikes on people making only 32 000 a year quote bogus they circulated an analysis stating that the resolution that obama had voted for would not have increase taxes on single taxpayer making less than 41 500 a year in total income
8789203 vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year
8789204 factcheck org a nonpartisan web site said the vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year the 32 000 figure it said was the amount of taxable income those people had
8789205 there is going to be a lot going on this offseason i promise you that
8789206 families are dispersed across the world these days and sometimes its the case that someone cannot get home in time for a funeral
8789207 for those who need it this is a very important service it means that rather than being excluded they can at least witness and be a part of a funeral as it happens in a time of stress this is something that can ease the pain
8789208 its a personal thing it doesnt go out for all and sundry to gawk at
8789209 there is a password for the family to send to people who want to watch online
8789210 the families have been absolutely delighted to be able to share in the proceedings when it wasnt possible for them to get over here and attend
8789211 its the first case that i know of in this area where a duck got an order of protection said michelle auletta prosecutor at the suffolk county district attorneys office
8789212 we did a lot of the things necessary to win the ball game
8789213 weve got a long ways to go before we can get comfortable with where were at
8789214 we saw a lot of the things we can improve on
8789215 we had five turnovers in the first six minutes of the game it felt like
8789216 before their offense had a chance to sustain a drive they were up 21 points
8789217 they lost a lot of key ingredients to the championship season but theyve still got a lot coming back
8789218 and we lost our teams food for a whole week
8789219 hello michael ballack iam muhannad nayef ali rafeea iam from jordan i
8789220 i find him as a fellow brit an absolute embarrassment he sounds like hes on the
8789221 i think this is a brilliant comentary and this part he howls like king lear and
8789222 he reminds me of elton brand of the nbas sixers
8789223 category by category year over year were up double digits
8789224 we believe there could be issues with the measurement that could be misrepresenting yahoo and we are reviewing comscores methodology and working with them to resolve these issues
8789225 it shows how the redesign is allowing myspace to reach far beyond the
8789226 the results indicated that home learning environment pre school effectiveness and primary school effectiveness all make separate significant impacts
8789227 the mothers educational attainment is the strongest effect theres no doubt about that but home and school and pre school environments are also important
8789228 and there are quite a few well educated people who do not provide a good home learning environment
8789229 we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because republican presidential candidate mccain is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
8789230 we love al gore we believe he was cheated in the 2000 election and that he would have been a great president
8789231 were proud that he keeps on serving this country and the world
8789232 mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8789233 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
8789234 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve ever experienced in the history of humankind
8789235 ill be happy when i weigh x amount of pounds
8789236 i hope that the justice department will raise some strenuous objections to this deal but the zero hour is upon us
8789237 when we announced our deal with yahoo we agreed to give the department of justice several months to review the deal before we began implementing it and we continue to cooperate with regulators as that process continues
8789238 ultimately we have confidence that theyll be able to conduct their review within that time period and allow us to move forward
8789239 for me its ultimately the order of the cosmos or what i describe as the creation
8789240 you cant simply have in my own judgment creation simply being a random event because it is so inherently ordered and the fact that the natural environment is being ordered where it can properly coexist over time
8789241 if you were simply reducing that to mathematical probabilities ive got to say it probably wouldnt have happened
8789242 so i think there is an intelligent mind at work
8789243 its not what we dont know that gets us in trouble its what we know for a fact that just aint so
8789244 catholic in his tastes and likes all sorts of art that is good of its kind
8789245 you work so hard and you feel like your team is going to be good but you never know until you play
8789246 theres no way to tell but im excited because i see so much talent i see us working together well and i see us making plays
8789247 weve had some big wins here over the years but i think that was one of the biggest
8789248 we jumped out to a lead and they responded and came back with a couple touchdowns and at that point right there i thought it was very important how are we going to respond to this are we going to let them go or are we going to respond to their challenge and we did i felt like when we left the field that day there was a different confidence a difference belief that our guys had i felt that that was a big big game in our time here

8789250 what are nasas current motivations for commercializing space why now

8789253 our work represents the first synthesis of concentric mqws surrounding the nanowire core
8789254 these mqw structures represent an unprecedented level of structural complexity and importantly enabled us to separately investigate two key components of a nanowire laser the cavity and gain medium
8789255 we have focused on one issue at a time and this has enabled us find the best structures efficiently
8789256 the purpose of decoupling the gain medium and the cavity is not to separate but to combine the best respective solutions
8789257 this is due to better coupling between the gain medium and resonant modes which subsequently lowers the threshold we believe that lasing could be achieved with fewer qws given optimized cavity structures
8789258 we are working on the combination of mqw and dopant modulation in a single nanowire to achieve an injection laser
8789259 a few fundamental issues need to be addressed to achieve this goal such as reducing cavity loss via optimizing the nanowire structure we are very optimistic about this direction based on our excellent control of nanowire structure and composition
8789260 i dont realize yet that i beat the no 1 in the world i dont realize that i played at the big court i dont know how im going sleep tonight i dont know
8789261 in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
8789262 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8789263 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8789264 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb russian aggression
8789265 john mccain is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue the same policies over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
8789266 on this the 45th anniversary of the march on washington and in honor of the legacies of my father and of bobby kennedy let us give our nation a leader who has heard this clarion call and will help us achieve the change we still need barack obama
8789267 it seemed to me that the clintons did what they needed to do
8789268 but it does also seem like the last two days were more about them than him
8789269 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8789270 they were able to make obama more acceptable and to restore some measure of party unity but they never defined john mccain in terms that will help them in the fall
8789271 i think mccain was able to thanks to the clintons successfully not be the pinata this week
8789272 sen mccain who once railed against the smears of karl rove when he was the target has morphed into candidate mccain who is using the same rove tactics and the same rove staff to repeat the same old politics of fear and smear well not this year not this time

8789279 leadership is getting someone to do what they dont want to do to achieve what they want to achieve
8789280 i dont believe in team motivation i believe in getting a team prepared so it knows it will have the necessary confidence when it steps on a field and be prepared to play a good game
8789281 setting a goal is not the main thing it is deciding how you will go about achieving it and staying with that plan
8789282 first become a winner in life then its easier to become a winner on the field
8789283 the more successful you become the longer the yardstick people use to measure you by
8789284 when you want to win a game you have to teach when you lose a game you have to learn
8789285 leadership is a matter of having people look at you and gain confidence seeing how you react if youre in control theyre in control

8789289 environment minister peter garrett has announced a political compromise that might not have sat well with peter garrett the activist rock star mr garrett has never hidden his personal views about uranium mining and had been a fervent anti nuclear campaigner since the late 1970s but on thursday he officially approved the expansion of the beverley uranium mine in south australia insisting it would not cause long term problems for the environment his transition into big party politics forced a new pragmatism on the former firebrand ive sought the advice of the csiro geoscience australia and additionally the chief scientist to provide me with guidance as to the best environmental standard that we need to set for the processes
8789290 im confident that the process will be at worlds best practice in terms of disposal of waste

8789298 president bush rebuked russia for its irresponsible decision tuesday to formally recognize two breakaway georgian regions which further raised fears of a new cold war
8789299 adding to the tension russian president dmitry medvedev threatened an unspecified military response if the united states follows through with a missile defense system near russias borders in poland and the czech republic
8789300 bush warned russia to respect the border of neighboring georgia and its separatist provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia which were at the heart of the week long battle between russia and georgia this month
8789301 medvedevs announcement tuesday on national television ignored strong opposition by the u s and europe
8789302 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war he said after saying russia will grant diplomatic recognition to the two regions
8789303 separately medvedev said his country may respond to a u s missile shield in europe we have to react somehow to react of course in a military way medvedev was quoted by the ria novosti news agency
8789304 but the russia dispute threatens prospects of u s russian cooperation in several important areas including access to oil dissuading iran from pursuing a nuclear weapons program and reaching agreements on arms control and nuclear proliferation
8789305 expressed concern about the security of an oil pipeline that runs through georgia
8789306 if that pipeline were destroyed or controlled by russia global energy supplies would be even more vulnerable to moscows influence

8789308 most of the patients you see as a dentist are somewhere on a continuum between mild apprehension and pee their pants terror nobody but nobody likes going to the dentist and going to the orthodontist forget it and as your patients get more and more apprehensive you get more and more frustrated and disturbed i cant tell you what the mechanism is but i can tell you those mental states are contagious so you either quit or deal i found a way to deal being up here isnt any worse than being down there
8789309 deconstructs heroes it kind of takes it all the way
8789310 how far do you take this superhero thing do you take a cat out of a tree or do you create world peace thats really the dilemma that they face superman has the ability to go to all the world leaders and say i will kill all of you if you dont behave he could do that but why doesnt he

8789317 john mccain ha votado con george bush el 90 por ciento de las veces al senador mccain le gusta hablar de tener criterio pero realmente qu criterio tienes si piensas que george bush ha estado en lo cierto en el 90 por ciento de las veces
8789318 no s ustedes pero yo no estoy dispuesto a apostar que la posibilidad de cambio sea del 10 por ciento
8789319 no creo que al senador mccain no le importe la vida de los estadounidenses realmente lo que creo es que no sabe lo que les pasa c mo se puede explicar que defina la clase media como la familia que ingresa m s de cinco millones de d lares al a o

8789330 the bottom of the housing downturn is coming into view
8789331 the stereotype of the republican party that were all a bunch of wealthy snobs
8789332 to be the party of sams club not just the country club
8789333 i went to college pre dentistry and got into organic and inorganic chemistry
8789334 and back then you had to get pretty close to a straight a average to get into dental school and i think i got a b or something in either organic or inorganic chemistry and i was discouraged and going through you know pretty much soul searching as a 19 or 20 year old kid and i went to see a career counselor at the u who happened to be some graduate student who im sure they gave a stipend to be a career counselor in their free time and it was you know this zen like thing in his office and he said what do you love to do you know
8789335 long story short i just told him i like current events i like history public policy and he said well go into something you love and do well and whatever you love is what youll do well in so that propelled me to go start taking some political science classes
8789336 norm coleman is a very gifted senator and wonderful senator and a friend he was a pretty well known minnesota political figure because he had been the democratic mayor of st paul dynamic well connected well financed
8789337 tim held that majority together which is so hard to do
8789338 theres nobody he cant talk to hes impossible to dislike and thats such a rare commodity on the republican side
8789339 for a number of days leading up to that there was a whole series of calls saying look nobody knows who you are you dont have any money
8789340 norms going to get the endorsement and youre just chasing the wind
8789341 under my watch weve doubled the proposed requirements for ethanol in gasoline here
8789342 we implemented the first in the nation biodiesel requirement in our diesel fuel 2 percent soy oil were one of the nations leaders in wind energy production and its largely part of some tax credits we put into law on my watch as governor
8789343 and the decision to do that stare down was tough we ended up getting it resolved making some compromises looking over the abyss into a government shutdown that was a challenge
8789344 i think barack obamas book the audacity of hope perhaps should be retitled the audacity of hypocrisy
8789345 they shouldnt have had the meeting in unity n h they should have had it in political expediency n h if there is such a community
8789346 hes been a conservative governor in a fairly liberal state and managed to maintain his popularity pretty well doing it
8789347 sure wed love to go to mellow mushroom with you again this week
8789348 this is a different approach to interactive entertainment and some people may not see it as a game
8789349 i prefer games that are a little more challenging and have some kind of thinking element rather than just observing
8789350 it has a lot of potential but a lot of the consumer base that might really like that type of game may be tough to attract
8789351 the graphic quality in this one is so high that it could be fun to watch what the zebras are doing all day
8789352 there are 12 million people who have come to this country to work and support their families
8789353 a blogueira paranaense samantha abreu estr ia no cron pios
8789354 eighty bucks to park what do you think is going on here
8789355 i just thought it was over the top i though it could be more reasonable because obama is a man of the people he doesnt want them to gouge us
8789356 weve talked to people parking along this area and theyre not happy
8789357 yes i did of course i did of course i did
8789358 these guys are charging like 80 bucks can they do that
8789359 its sounds like robbery but unfortunately they can do that
8789360 our mission is to raise funds but what weve really done is change the paradigm
8789361 it has been less about asking people for money but more about creating this sustained community of support
8789362 everyone i reached out to supported hillary and i was able to ask them to come on board
8789363 its not just a top down fundraising model where big donations are all that matter
8789364 theyve seen this kind of grass roots campaign be successful before with gov patrick
8789365 there will be lots of glitz and glamour and spectacle but once that is done
8789366 senator obama what have you done and what have you run
8789367 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8789368 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005 when katrina came ashore
8789369 weve had three years to put together a plan that never existed before
8789370 its very very important that we play the way we practiced and trained over the last year and a half
8789371 theres a way that we operate theres a chain of command theres a way that we interact with each other and we cant afford to be in a disorganized way as we confront the challenges that were going to see here
8789372 we plan to sit in a bar and watch the whole thing
8789373 amyloid beta measurements in the brain may turn out to be a good indicator of how well the cells are communicating with each other

8789375 we know she used that microwave as the instrument of death
8789376 this cut the crap moment is not the stuff of fiction

8789378 if you have to permit on the fly its not preferred
8789379 were here to assist you in facilitating your first amendment rights follow us please
8789380 so what well do is well just go ahead and make some allowances
8789381 the skill set you need in terms of the coordination and balance and things like that you cannot choose to drink and ride its just the wrong choice to make
8789382 our vision is really toward zero deaths everyone counts so were not exactly celebrating these numbers
8789383 age 21 drinking laws have been proven time and again effective in preventing deaths and injuries
8789384 we dont keep books that are soiled or damaged whether they are library books or donations from the public some of the books are relatively new or may be duplicates which we just cannot keep because of space constraints
8789385 we purchase museum passes that are loaned out to patrons for either free admission or a substantially reduced admission price
8789386 it depends on what the fundraiser happens to be as to how much help is needed
8789387 their entire book collection for adult readers was lost during the june floods
8789388 we will donate a minimum of 100 of our proceeds from the sale and we really hope people will consider making a contribution to our collection container
8789389 i heard one resounding theme from these meetings which is we need the mural down
8789390 it would be less appropriate for an adult i am not sure i understand
8789391 i have never heard any negative remarks about it never
8789392 i was speechless believe me when i found out that there was such a thing in this school and then they had the nerve to take it off the wall
8789393 it belongs to the town to start with this is what severin haines wants
8789394 i cant give you that answer because i havent seen it
8789395 but that isnt the point as far as i am concerned it was very mishandled i think
8789396 its been hung there for 20 years and all of a sudden its not acceptable somebody should learn the fables and explain them to the children
8789397 i made the decision based on what i truly felt was best for the wood school children
8789398 i truly felt that that mural is not what wood school is all about which is safe and cheerful classrooms what matters is that it goes somewhere and is appreciated
8789399 whatever was going to blow away has already blown away
8789400 it is simply impossible to determine exactly where and when gustav will make final landfall

8789404 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
8789405 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8789406 but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8789407 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8789408 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8789409 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8789410 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8789411 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8789412 i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
8789413 america we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future
8789414 one of the greatest gifts of our democracy is the opportunity to change course every four years
8789415 this line has the most diverse positive energy and the most hope that i have felt in years and years
8789416 i cannot think of any other period in my life with the exception of the civil rights movement that i felt more proud to be an american
8789417 were not just here today for a ball game were here for a political development for emancipation from ancient fears to remove doubts and to choose hope and that is a big deal it seems to be me
8789418 i do think that on this 54 year journey since the supreme court ruling of brown vs board of education which outlawed segregation barack is running the last lap of the 54 year relay team
8789419 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8789420 barack obama is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the unites states
8789421 senator obama this is truly a good day for america too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations
8789422 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8789423 this is senator mccains decision and his announcement and we all want to be respectful of his desire to have the chance to announce it himself
8789424 it opens the road for all of latin america to start visualizing legal paths to abortion
8789425 this tragedy we are living in mexico city is going to spread to other states
8789426 this decision was in regard to mexico citys legislative assembly but in the end it establishes a precedent that can be applied to other local lawmaking bodies
8789427 its not up to the supreme court to legalize or criminalize abortion
8789428 they are just encouraging women to be dirty and loose
8789429 the justices decision is only going to spread more irresponsible behavior
8789430 if it were possible to do bleach as a live action movie i wouldnt have drawn the manga i want to draw something that can only be done as a manga
8789431 kark has confirmed that former arkansas governor mike huckabee will join presidential candidate john mccain at a rally in dayton ohio friday still unknown is why while some say its just a sign of unity in the party others speculate huckabee could be mccains pick for vice president mccain should make his vice presidential announcement friday the republicans start their national convention in st paul minnesota on monday
8789432 obama is a bad boy for not picking the one who got millions of votes and came in 2nd
8789433 the great society rests on abundance and liberty for all it demands an end to poverty and racial injustice to which we are totally committed in our time but that is just the beginning
8789434 with the greatest percentage of the total popular vote 61 ever attained
8789435 our government makes no sense unless it is founded in a deeply felt religious faith and i dont care what it is
8789436 weve really addressed our needs and added great depth at every position the competition is only going to make each of our players better
8789437 can there be any difference between div and span with display block
8789438 the event will showcase 11 of indias finest couturiers and aims to provide a platform for indian couture in the same way that the wills lifestyle india fashion week has been a powerful stage for indian pr t a porter
8789439 we are delighted to formally announce the staging of indias first couture fashion week hdil india couture week this event will be a celebration of indian fashion and will feature some of the countrys finest couture designers
8789440 after a period of relative unrest in the industry it is wonderful to see the fashion community coming together on one platform to progress the cause of indian fashion
8789441 we are proud to be associated with hicw an event created to celebrate indias fashion heritage by showcasing leading couture designers of the day
8789442 this move into fashion is in broader synergy with the groups long term strategies and objectives we believe fashion especially in the area of couture and bridal wear is a central interest in the lives of a great proportion of indians we would like to be part of ensuring that indias fashion heritage is preserved and nurtured our core belief at hdil is in creating value and with hdil india couture week we would like to create value for the indian fashion industry
8789443 i want to make sure everything is taken into consideration
8789444 including the library it would be nice to tie that into the townwide celebration something once a week or perhaps once a month
8789445 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
8789446 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent
8789447 i think thats taking some of the steam out of this rally
8789448 if people start canceling their vacations to the gulf because of the storm were probably going to have less demand for fuel than anticipated
8789449 i have worked with akshay for eight years i really respect him for the way he has groomed himself he has become one of the biggest metrosexual stars most stylish fashion icon and he is so successful that i am proud of him just look from where he has come and where he has reached
8789450 i started designing for akshay in 1992 but i stopped working with him in 2000 because i had to move on also both of us needed to take a break from each other
8789451 i started 16 years back at that time the only opportunity i got was in bollywood i think it was good for me as it has created awareness about my brand i have met a lot of actors who want to wear clothes designed by me
8789452 the people i dress up are the best dressed they are really great with clothes they have a great body to carry off anything and they have a good style of their own
8789453 shilpa likes deeper and rich indian colours she likes to wear emerald she loves red and it really suits her even bipasha likes red katrina likes pastel and lighter shades
8789454 it is fun to work with actors and also challenging to make them look different every time it is also a challenge for them to get into a character every time with different clothes and looks a lot of hard work is required in bollywood
8789455 when i started fashion was not even taking off in a very big manner and i think it was after four to five years that i felt the need to do creative work for myself thats when i started doing clothes that were more wearable and saleable
8789456 i came at the right time for mainstream fashion luckily i have kept a very good balance between bollywood and mainstream fashion till now
8789457 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8789458 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8789459 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8789460 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8789461 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8789462 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8789463 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8789464 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8789465 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8789466 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8789467 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8789468 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8789469 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8789470 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8789471 brides should go traditional with a look of modernity mix and match is in fashion but an elegant bride should stick to the basics
8789472 young brides are becoming very choosy about their wedding trousseaus they tend to experiment a lot with designs and opt for mix and match saris and lehengas its high time to break this monotony
8789473 the colour and appeal of my collection is indian but as always i have given it a european touch
8789474 lace petit fleur like intricate rendering in thread crystals and beads complete the look
8789475 marriage is not only about brides every family member plays a definite role my collection offers a wide range of choice for everyone
8789476 flowers are my usp i tried hard to break away from them but on popular demand flowers have made a comeback in my collection
8789477 thanks to these flowers people can recognize my collection just by seeing it
8789478 i have used all happy colours to match the mood of the festivities
8789479 i had been telling my story for years and believed it to be true
8789480 this is an environment in which were likely to get a lot of head fakes both on the upside and the downside
8789481 this is just sort of data that trickles out that can be very positive one day and negative the next we dont yet think it signals a trend
8789482 were not going to let our food costs rise faster than our food budgets so if we can buy in bulk we can save in a per eating effect
8789483 overall these trends last a long period of time because consumers adjust their buying habits and they change their routine
8789484 i wanted to be able to buy in bulk when things were on sale or at a pretty good price and have the room to save and freeze and store anything that we can get a good price
8789485 freezers tend to be countercyclical meaning that they generally do better when the economy is soft because people go out less and buy groceries in bulk
8789486 generate a variety of possibilities before deciding what to do
8789487 i think we are going to be doing much better in the 3rd quarter of this year after people pay their taxes
8789488 what objective criteria could be used to resolve this conflict
8789489 everything should be as simple as it is but not simpler
8789490 to read a newspaper is to refrain from reading something worthwhile the first discipline of education must therefore be to refuse resolutely to feed the mind with canned chatter
8789491 this is a classic partnership where were leveraging mutual assets
8789492 young guys are still watching live action sports so we still have a big presence there but theyre also spending a lot of time gaming thats where guys are these days
8789493 gaming is part of the bridge to that next group of consumers theyre trying to tap into
8789494 at the same time its not so far away from their core consumers and their group of classic sports like golf and football
8789495 a conclusion is the place where you got tired of thinking
8789496 it is undesirable to believe a proposition when there is no ground whatsoever for supposing it is true
8789497 irrationally held truths may be more harmful than reasoned errors
8789498 the most perfidious way of harming a cause consists of defending it deliberately with faulty arguments
8789499 everything should be as simple as it is but not simpler
8789500 generate a variety of possibilities before deciding what to do
8789501 i think we are going to be doing much better in the 3rd quarter of this year after people pay their taxes
8789502 what objective criteria could be used to resolve this conflict
8789503 everything should be as simple as it is but not simpler
8789504 to read a newspaper is to refrain from reading something worthwhile the first discipline of education must therefore be to refuse resolutely to feed the mind with canned chatter
8789505 it is obvious that landlords in vermont know that no direct punishment will be imposed for housing code violations in rental properties
8789506 the harshest consequence of this practice falls on the tenants not the landlord
8789507 tenants are thrown out of their homes when the department finds that serious housing code violations are not corrected these enforcement powers were meant to protect the tenants safety not to punish tenants when their landlords fail to correct code violations
8789508 when tenants call up code enforcement officials they dont have to worry about the inspector evicting them
8789509 they know the landlord isnt going to laugh about it
8789510 mandamus takes an official by the coat lapel and orders him to do what up to that moment he has felt he had no right to do and was under no compulsion to do
8789511 the inspector enters into a dialogue with the landowner and attempts to move the landowner closer and closer to compliance with the codes
8789512 of course there are situations that arise where conditions are discovered at a building that are so hazardous the only way to ensure safety of tenants are to ask them to vacate
8789513 there are a few bad apples out there who wont do the right thing
8789514 things have gotten better its all been renovated and carpeted
8789515 there will be heavy sledding for the u s economy during the next couple of quarters
8789516 with the rest of the world now slowing and the dollar off its lows the u s will be more reliant on domestic demand in coming quarters
8789517 since consumer spending is slowing down and the credit crunch is tightening its grip it is hard to foresee another quarter with such a robust gdp headline for some time
8789518 think five years is a good long time to hold a fund
8789519 it was 15 20 years after people began smoking that we saw concerns associated with it
8789520 really at the heart of my concern is that we shouldnt wait for a definitive study to come out but err on the side of being safe rather than sorry later
8789521 cell phone use and brain tumor risk is no longer a myth
8789522 in the context of the fact that widespread mobile phone usage commenced in the mid 1980s earliest in northern europe with the first 10 years of widespread usage ending in the mid 1990s and the fact that solid tumors may take several years to trigger and form it seems plausible to expect that if no appropriate changes are made by industry and consumers alike in the next 5 10 years the aforementioned concerning associations will likely be definitely proven in the medical literature
8789523 taken together the data compellingly suggest that the link between mobile phones and brain tumors should no longer be regarded as a myth
8789524 there is currently enough evidence and technology available to warrant industry and governments alike in taking immediate steps to reduce exposure of consumers to mobile phone related electromagnetic radiation and to make consumers clearly aware of potential dangers and how to use this technology sensibly and safely
8789525 it is anticipated that this danger has far broader public health implications than asbestos and smoking and directly concerns all of us particularly the younger generation including very young children
8789526 the human species has changed its electromagnetic background more than any other aspect of the environment
8789527 the entire population of the world is the subject of a giant experiment
8789528 the album is heralded by the sound of a heartbeat pounding in the listeners ears
8789529 we are going to rock rock hard and rock hard with plenty of units shifted
8789530 saya terlambat bangun bu karena saya bermimpi naik balon udara dan di bawa jauuuuuuh ke wilayah terasing ketika saya terbangun hari sudah siang bu
8789531 while we may be laying quietly in the shadows right now we are not dormant we have some plans coming up some of it you do know about some you dont so well continue on with the news that we have december ep we have started this well probably be recording in october sometime we will be re recording the last breath of man from our 7
8789532 ive been in obamas tour since the beginning of it
8789533 whether its restaurants or street vendors who are selling barack obama paraphernalia
8789534 just for the atmosphere and to meet people from different states
8789535 there is a high frequency of seasonal affective disorder in high latitudes where light exposure is limited and bright light therapy is a successful antidepressant treatment

8789537 environmentalism seems to be the religion of choice for urban atheists facts arent necessary because the tenets of environmentalism are all about belief about whether you are going to be one of the people on the side of salvation or on the side of doom

8789547 green lake can hold a relatively small amount of water and receives water from only the western part of the reservoir system
8789548 we cant harvest from a range of water green lake doesnt have the flexibility that taylors lake does
8789549 the first step was to make a decision about which lakes to use and the second is to create a detailed implementation plan
8789550 in regard to possible problems at taylors lake we note what the community is saying and what needs developing
8789551 thats the feedback we are looking for in developing taylors lake and the costs associated with that we will need support to get those amenities to make taylors lake the lake the community wants it to be
8789552 second its the environment gwmwater hasnt entertained any proposal which would reduce our commitment to the environment 83 000 megalitres of the savings from the pipeline is going to the environment
8789553 its certainly not a pleasant time and we would prefer not to do it but were still in a position to grow into the future and provide further opportunities for regional victoria
8789554 we will do whatever we can to help them get through this difficult time
8789555 we try to reduce water use and we minimise car use as much as we can
8789556 rubbish is a big issue for us obviously everything you buy these days is wrapped in plastic although we recycle as much as we can we still have half a bin full between the two of us each week it would be interesting to receive feedback on reducing rubbish
8789557 in my view they are planning to do what they did with melbournes clearways make the announcement start a fight and bash communities into submission but this hopefully will force them to consult the public
8789558 i think the government would be making an extremely bad mistake if they put b triples on single lane highways its just not on
8789559 we cant bury our head in the sand saying there cant be more trucks if were moving grain through the domestic market then it has to go by road but we need better roads and facilities for these trucks
8789560 i have been in talks with vicroads and i was told the b triples would only be on dual lane highways
8789561 a lot of people wont get on the highway if this happens its just so dangerous
8789562 victorias freight task is expected to double by 2030 thats more tvs dvds and food to be moved around the state and we need to move it as efficiently as possible
8789563 the victorian government continues to assess the views of the community and the industry to look at the impact of high productivity vehicles
8789564 there is a wide range of reasons to why there should be water
8789565 there is no real area to go for social and relaxation activities for people here the lake offers environmental benefits such as migratory birds start here and head back down to the douglas wetlands then there are the tourism benefits that it has on the town thousands of people come here when there is water in the lake
8789566 were trying to gauge what public support we have to put water in the lake
8789567 everybody has the right to try to improve these lakes we are only caretakers for the next generation
8789568 we need to leave them in better condition than what our grandparents left them in
8789569 when the studies were happening for the pipeline they put a map on the wall and said x amount would be allocated for natimuk lake and other lakes but now it comes to the crunch it seems like there is no water to spare
8789570 it wasnt my career choice but it was a bit of tongue in cheek a bit of fun
8789571 i have fond memories of growing up in natimuk and always looked forward with great excitement to the annual show
8789572 the victim was attending clarendon college in ballarat on a football scholarship and could not play football after the incident
8789573 he lives with his parents in murtoa who are well known in the district they run businesses and are well respected in the community
8789574 the offence was completely out of character it was fuelled by alcohol he was intoxicated on the night
8789575 he had believed the victim had made approaches to his girlfriend he wrongly believed that
8789576 and now his life has changed and will change forever
8789577 this impacts on a big problem we have in society of young drunken assaults
8789578 this was an isolated act a stupid act but just because its your first offence and your first time in court it doesnt mean people dont go to jail
8789579 you know what impact it has had but you havent had your football taken away from you have you
8789580 its also the emotional trauma hes concerned about going out socially now and his vce has been impacted by this
8789581 its too late to say sorry the next day if he is dead
8789582 if that punch had hit somewhere else he could have died
8789583 you have showed sincere remorse but its too late after the event and why because you thought he was chatting up your girl
8789584 if he was chatting up your girl what is wrong with that you dont own her its not illegal
8789585 the community you are part of would have been horrified by your behaviour

8789587 despite the high corporate tax rates many foreign multinationals recognize the importance of the us market from a global standpoint
8789588 they understand that the business and profit opportunities in the united states often outweigh the tax costs of doing business in the united states
8789589 a real meaningful reduction in the us corporate tax rate would likely stimulate even greater investment by foreign based multinationals into us corporations
8789590 several other countries in recent years have reduced corporate tax rates in an attempt to attract such investment and for the most part such measures have been successful
8789591 us based multinational groups often feel they are at a disadvantage compared to certain foreign based multinational groups because of high us corporate tax rates a us tax system that taxes us corporations on their worldwide income and the application of certain anti deferral regimes such as the subpart f regime
8789592 we will seek to reach an agreement on this with grave resolution
8789593 i think its an important signal in the overall direction of what we hope to get back on track in doha but in its own right it stands as a significant achievement

8789605 we have told our union members to call a leave of absence to join the rally in bangkok to oust this government which has been damaging the country over the past seven months
8789606 absolutely spent was i thinking about leaving him in i definitely had a thought about it but i knew there definitely was no sense in sending him back out
8789607 this is our time to hold these leads this is our job were not getting it done right now
8789608 it would be kind of interesting wouldnt it to play for the nlcs title right here
8789609 we have seen a small improvement in consumer confidence in august but this should not be seen as a turnaround in core sentiment
8789610 the improvement could be down to a number of recent factors which are mostly of short term influence
8789611 the fears that i have expressed over the last six months have started to come to fruition
8789612 ive obviously voted on quite a number of occasions now for small cuts but we need to act and we probably need to act in larger amounts than that we need to actually get ahead of the game and it appears that we are now behind
8789613 there are clearly signs that they are moving in that direction fairly slowly
8789614 yes rates probably should have started to come down by now but i can understand the uncertainty around that and why as a central bank they would want to err on the side of caution
8789615 we are going to see much more dramatic drops in output
8789616 the way to get out of it is to act by interest rate cuts and fiscal stimulus and other things to try help people who are hurt through this
8789617 sitting by doing nothing is not going to get us out of this and hoping that a knight in shining armour will come and lift us out of this is optimistic in the extreme
8789618 to sit and worry about inflation expectations and what is going to happen to those rather than worry about the fact that the economy is going to go into a recession seems to be misguided
8789619 what we have now is a turning point in many ways certainly you might think of it as a paradigm shift we have a global financial crisis an oil shock coming people with little experience of what is really going on
8789620 the question is whats going to happen in prices in 18 months down the road and the answer is inflation is going to plummet like a rock
8789621 the dollar and the trade deficit how does productivity fit in
8789622 hes out of control i want him to stop hurting and talking to the media about the people i love
8789623 whos out of control whose life is out of control give me a break
8789624 going from place to place being dragged around by samantha so she can make more money off of lindsay being there when she spins shes gone from making 7 million to less than a million a movie whos out of control
8789625 i go and help people in rehab thats control how can she say im out of control
8789626 i want lindsay to be in a good place when i started looking at what samantha was doing dragging lindsay to clubs drinking around lindsay samantha is one of the biggest problems in her life
8789627 thats what dina told me im reacting on what dina said but then dina steps out of the picture because she wants to look like the good guy
8789628 she wants to try to look good and stay on lindsays good side instead of being a good parent

8789631 the threat is today and tomorrow so she will be staying home from school tomorrow
8789632 the schools remain open tomorrow while rumors are not substantiated we are taking extra precautions well have increased police presence in the parking lot and building
8789633 safety is our top priority for all students and staff we will continue to investigate all safety concerns and implement safety protocol according to established guidelines
8789634 we are attempting to evaluate the credibility of those threats are we dealing with an articulated plan no it doesnt appear thats the case right now
8789635 this is not a novel to be tossed lightly aside it should be thrown with great force
8789636 i realize im not the typical candidate for this office
8789637 what i will not do is suggest that the senator takes positions for political reasons because one thing we need to change about american politics is this idea that people cannot disagree without questioning each others motives or their patriotism
8789638 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8789639 on november 4th we must stand up and say 8 is enough
8789640 to the love of my life the next first lady michelle obama
8789641 i though id be pretty old if i saw it at all
8789642 i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
8789643 you need a president that puts barney smith before smith barney
8789644 was known as a clear thinker and a great orator
8789645 we understand that in the process of e coli we have little we can with that were helpless when it comes to something like this bacterium
8789646 it could happen to the cleanest restaurant you can find
8789647 we can also see how fear and fixed mindset thinking actually undermines accountability by looking at patrick lencionis framework described in
8789648 the only thing we have to fear is fear itself
8789649 there can be no patriotism without permanent opposition and criticism
8789650 we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience and disappointment that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights
8789651 we had boarded the flight and sat for an hour and a half
8789652 we were then told we all had to disembark again
8789653 the pilot was left to tell all the passengers that there would no longer be a flight and the reasons for this
8789654 it is the nature of man to rise to greatness if greatness is expected of him
8789655 the democratic platform on the first day of the convention was somewhat vague
8789656 thats been the big criticism from republicans that hes all show and no substance
8789657 if voters dont know who he is after this they never will
8789658 you can expect tomorrow that republicans are going to criticise everything the democratic party said tonight
8789659 weve got to get into the habit of defending ourselves
8789660 i hope the countrys above that above negative ads and that they will vote not out of fear
8789661 its so positive rather than the politics of fear its the politics of optimism even republicans are tired of the fear of the warmongering
8789662 he said that were here as americans not as democrats he played how hard times really are but said we can change
8789663 we have serious grounds to think that there were u s citizens right in the combat zone
8789664 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
8789665 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8789666 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8789667 it seems like an easy solution in reality it turns out that its not always so
8789668 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
8789669 it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8789670 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8789671 we try and keep our industry out of politics and into marketing opportunities but sometimes its very difficult to separate the two
8789672 at this point if russia were to walk back from certain agreements they have made it would clearly delay any future aspirations they have of joining the
8789673 trying to draw up a strong text signifying our unwillingness to accept
8789674 sanctions are being considered and many other means as well
8789675 this has been a summer that many retailers would rather forget the downturn in the housing market is continuing to depress sales for those shops selling big ticket items
8789676 retail conditions have been extremely tough this summer and the wet august has been a further blow sadly no let up is expected as we head into early autumn the business outlook is particularly weak and retailers are having to scale back their employment and investment plans in an attempt to ride out the storm
8789677 augusts cbi distributive trades survey makes for pretty grim reading not least because the reported sales balance fell to yet a new record low and the surveys been going since the early 1980s suggesting that conditions on the high street are even worse than in the previous recession even a near term cut in interest rates wont bail out the economy over the next few months indeed we now expect both consumer spending and overall gdp to fall next year
8789678 this improvement could be down to a number of recent factors which are mostly of short term influence such as cheaper petrol offers summer holidays happening or just a general feeling of things cant get any worse can they in particular winning gold medals in the olympics seems to have had a lifting effect when we looked at the index score before and after the olympics weekend the score rose 3 points between the first and second weekend this combined with summer holiday euphoria may have helped lift consumers perceptions of their personal situation and the general economy
8789679 it is the nature of man to rise to greatness if greatness is expected of him
8789680 one of the most important reasons is that russia must protect abkhazia and south ossetia against genocide by the war criminal georgian president mikheil
8789681 saakashvili is totally militarized and brought in outside support washington gave them all of the weapons and it has started to give weapons to the war criminal again
8789682 russia waited for 20 years to accept south ossetia and abkhazia south ossetia and abkhazia never lived together with independent georgia never the question is how many years should we wait russia now has to make a new course a new policy
8789683 if the u s and britain think they are first level countries and russia a second level country we dont agree
8789684 we are the first sort if you recognize that kosovo is an independent country fine we will do the same with other countries
8789685 this is a strong message to everybody those who think that aggression against russia is okay should know that there will be a strong response
8789686 the west is very much afraid of the militarization of russia they are afraid russia will solve its problems the way it did in south ossetia through military strength
8789687 we know there is a huge difference between the e u and the u s
8789688 the fact is that us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders
8789689 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of
8789690 those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8789691 i dont think theres anything to announce yet but i know that that is under discussion
8789692 it is time to establish the truth about the crimes committed before and during russias invasion of georgia
8789693 georgia continues the redeployment of its forces in the direction of south ossetia and the restoration of the combat capability of its troops
8789694 a belt of obesity stretching across wales the north midlands and northern england
8789695 around 3 per cent of primary care organisations do not fund the use of drug therapy for obesity despite the recommendations of organisations such as the national institute for clinical excellence
8789696 new audit reveals inequality in nhs services to tackle obesity across the uk
8789697 absolutely ridiculous to suggest that shetland is an obesity hotspot
8789698 hes got a huge serve and being a lefty makes it tougher
8789699 hes won doubles slams before two tournaments at the start of this year
8789700 he will give anyone a tough match very rarely will he lose easily he moves really well up at the net doesnt give you a lot of rhythm and i think hes definitely in the top two or three net players for now
8789701 theres very few guys that play that well up at the net and he moves well up there too it was a tough match
8789702 i dont mind playing against guys that come to the net a lot but he serves so well thats what makes it tough
8789703 when you find it hard to break someone and theyre coming in all the time against you then it makes it tricky
8789704 but i started to return well toward the end of the third set obviously broke him twice in the fourth that was the difference compared with the first three sets even though i won the set
8789705 apart from the game where i broke him i won very few points on his serve same again in the second set so it was really tricky
8789706 hes a really tough guy to play against and i was happy i won in four sets
8789707 hawk eye is expensive but i think when theres a huge crowd like that its absolutely packed great atmosphere the crowd are enjoying it theyre making a lot of noise
8789708 hawk eye is obviously for the players but also i think the reason why it came into tennis is because the fans really enjoy it and i think its tough as well for officials theres a lot of pressure when youve got a court thats that close the fans are making a bit of noise
8789709 it is the nature of man to rise to greatness if greatness is expected of him
8789710 a day without laughter love or dessert is a total loss of a day
8789711 this is a continuation of the story of dan ross a fellow coconut tree divers instructor and personal friend who is currently being investigated for murder by honduran police following the freak death of mariska mast a 23 year old dutch student
8789712 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8789713 america our work will not be easy the challenges we face require tough choices and democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the worn out ideas and politics of the past
8789714 you think about everything from campaign finance to immigration and on and theres john mccain working across party lines senator obama doesnt have a record now he can make the claim and he can hold himself up as pure and trying to reach to a new generation of post partisan politics but he has to do so largely based on rhetoric and wishful thinking because he doesnt have the record
8789715 there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically
8789716 hes pretty much a conventional liberal on the issues and has few examples of breaking with his own party so how does obama try to pull off being post partisan
8789717 his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
8789718 boren the lone democrat in oklahomas congressional delegate said that while obama has talked about working with republicans unfortunately his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
8789719 the record shows obama to be a fairly doctrinaire liberal democrat
8789720 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8789721 for a couple of days theyve been saying you voted to raise taxes something like 94 times that seems to be the drumbeat thats going to happen during this campaign are you going to raise taxes in a big way for average americans
8789722 i mean this is the standard fare of politics and the truth of the matter is that the only bills that i voted for for the most part since ive been in the senate were introduced by republicans with george bush you know they were the majority for a big chunk of the time i was there
8789723 finally the obama people are too convinced that they can define mccain as bush iii the case is just factually inaccurate mccain will be able to pull out dozens of instances from torture to global warming to spending in which he broke with his party as rush limbaugh will tell you
8789724 as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq
8789725 in early november 2003 at a time when fred dalton thompson was playing a tough d a on law and order john mccain was cross examining donald rumsfeld for real on capitol hill it was still very early into the u s occupation of iraq but the as yet unacknowledged by rummy that is insurgency was already out of control alone among his fellow gop senators mccain blasted rumsfeld for not putting enough u s troops on the ground and for resorting too soon to iraqification that is transferring security to ill prepared iraqi forces in an extraordinarily blunt speech at the council on foreign relations that grim autumn mccain warned that ultimately iraq could become another vietnam if we lose popular support in the united states the next day the secretary of defense asked mccain to breakfast i read y our speech harrumphed rumsfeld that must have been an enjoyable experience for him mccain later joked to me then rummy patiently explained to his fellow republican why he and his top civilian brass paul wolfowitz doug feith and the usual crowd of incompetents would continue to do things the same way they believed there was no need for additional troops mccain later related mccain had already realized that rumsfeld was a lost cause the real question the senator suggested to me back then was whether george w bush himself would push rummy to make changes id like to see the president fully engaged mccain said bush needed to be on top of more details of whats going on as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq right down to the need for bush to get engaged and fire rumsfeld mccain was so right that among military experts today the emerging conventional wisdom about bushs current surg e is that if it had occurred back then when mccain wanted it and the political will existed in this country to support it for the necessary number of years it might well have succeeded
8789726 widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush
8789727 on global warming mccain is widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush immediately after the 2004 election in which he stumped for bushs re election he sharply distanced himself from bush on climate change calling the administrations stance terribly disappointing mccain had co sponsored a bill with sen joe lieberman to curb greenhouse gases in 2003 bush had opposed any such move citing possible harm to the economy and doubts over global warming
8789728 he said that our economy has made great progress under this president he said that the fundamentals of the e conomy are strong
8789729 the second and third quotes the obama campaign uses from mccain are more misleading the ad shows mccain saying t heres been great progress economically the quote comes from an interview mccain did with peter cook at bloomberg television in april mccain was making a case for what he believed were positive economic developments during bushs time in office however the fuller quote shows mccain was saying that whatever progress had been made it wouldnt be enough to comfort families facing these tremendous economic challenges his comments overall are pessimistic he cites challenging times and enormous difficulties the obama campaign distorts his views by using just a snippet of his remarks
8789730 im going to ask you a version of the ronald reagan question you think if americans were asked are you better off today than you were before george bush took office more than seven years ago what answer would they give
8789731 certainly in this time we are in very challenging times
8789732 i think if you look at the overall record and millions of jobs have been created et cetera et cetera yo u could make an argument that theres been great progress economically over that period of time but thats no comfort thats no comfort to families now that are facing these tremendous economic challenges but let me just add peter the fundamentals of americas economy are strong were the greatest exporter the greatest importer the greatest innovator the greatest producer still the greatest economic engine in the world and by the way exports and free trade are a key element in economic recovery but these are tough times tough times and nobody knows that more than american families including in small towns of pennsylvania they havent lost their fundamental religious beliefs their respect for the constitution their right to bear arms they are still keep america as a beacon of hope and freedom throughout the world
8789733 he knows how to twist with the best of them
8789734 although obama gets substantial mileage out of running against politics as usual he provided a reminder on friday that he knows how to twist with the best of them
8789735 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow but i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet twenty first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy
8789736 i do not make a promise that we can reduce the budget deficit by 2013
8789737 i do not make a promise that we can reduce it by 2013 because i think it is important for us to make some critical investments right now in americas families obama told reporters this week when asked if hed match mccains pledge
8789738 since winning the nomination obama reportedly has been moving toward the middle of the political spectrum but on the budget he still sounds left of center with no interest in eliminating deficit spending
8789739 frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years
8789740 barack obama says john mccains plan to balance the budget doesnt add up easy for him to say its not a goal hes even trying to reach not only does obama say he wont eliminate the deficit in his first term as mccain aims to do he frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years considering his own spending plans
8789741 obama has rhetorically committed to a pay as you go approach by offsetting new spending and tax cuts with new taxes or spending cuts but his proposals do not come close to meeting this standard
8789742 has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of
8789743 the obama campaign responds that tax cuts once enacted are usually renewed and do not expire therefore they say obama can legitimately claim to be recouping money for other purposes by scaling back the tax cuts obama has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of what he wants to do
8789744 both obama and clinton promised to not raise taxes on those making less than 200 000 or 250 000 a year they both just emasculated their domestic programs returning the rich to their clinton era tax rates will yield at best 40 billion a year in revenue its impossible to fund a health care plan let alone anything else with that kind of money the consequences are clear if elected they will have to break their pledge and thus destroy their credibility or run a minimalist administration
8789745 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8789746 the latest additions to sen barack obamas energy plan outlined during an appearance in lansing monday may win the democratic presidential candidate some votes from disgruntled consumers in november but theyll do nothing to answer the nations long term needs
8789747 when his presumptive republican opponent sen john mccain r ariz proposed a gas tax holiday as a way to reduce the high cost of driving mr obama showed political courage and intellectual honesty by refusing to sign on to that obvious gimmick its an idea to get them through an election mr obama said now he has two such gimmicks of his own
8789748 the politics may have changed but the facts havent the accuracy of sen mccains original position has not changed offshore drilling would not lower gas prices today it would not lower gas prices next year and it would not lower gas prices five years from now
8789749 i think john mccains proposal for a three month tax holiday is a bad idea
8789750 in this campaign john mccain is offering the same old gimmicks that will provide almost no short term relief to folks who are struggling with high gas prices gimmicks that will only increase our addiction for another four years
8789751 that might make sense in washington but it doesnt make sense for america in fact it makes about as much sense as his proposal to build 45 new nuclear reactors without a plan to store the waste some place other than guess where right here in nevada at yucca mountain
8789752 democratic presidential candidate barack obamas proposal for a windfall profits tax on oil companies could cost 15 billion a year at last years profit levels a campaign adviser said
8789753 obama may levy 15 billion tax on oil company profit
8789754 but to add a five year tax increase on top of that to pay for a one year gift to voters would indeed increase the cost of doing business that cost would be passed along in forgone investment in new production lower dividends for pension funds and other shareholders and higher prices at the pump thus socking it to the consumers whom the plan is supposed to help if oil prices fall there might be no windfall profits to tax then the obama rebate would have to be paid for through spending cuts taxes on something else or borrowing
8789755 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families
8789756 what obama voted for was a budget resolution that would have allowed most of the provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to expire in particular the resolution would allow the 25 percent tax bracket to return to its pre 2001 level of 28 percent that bracket kicks in at 32 550 for an individual or 65 100 for a married couple but as those of you who have filled out a 1040 know thats not actually how income taxes work we dont pay taxes on our total earnings we pay them based on our taxable income the urban brookings tax policy centers eric toder told factcheck org that people with taxable income of 32 000 would have a total income greater than that in 2008 anyone filing taxes with single status would be entitled to a standar d deduction of 5 450 as well as a personal exemption of 3 500 so to have a taxable income high enough to reach the 25 percent bracket an individual would need to earn at least 41 500 in total income while a married couple would need a combined income of at least 83 000
8789757 certainly obamas votes indicate a willingness to raise taxes and obama has not been shy about saying explicitly that he will raise some taxes
8789758 campaign aides to senator obama today called the charge that he voted for tax hikes on people making only 32 000 a year quote bogus they circulated an analysis stating that the resolution that obama had voted for would not have increase taxes on single taxpayer making less than 41 500 a year in total income
8789759 vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year
8789760 factcheck org a nonpartisan web site said the vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year the 32 000 figure it said was the amount of taxable income those people had

8789770 the obama campaign has tonight again demonstrated that it will try to silence voices with which it does not agree this should chill all americans for it offers a preview of the tactics to which a president obama might harness the power of the federal government the means chosen include harassment of television stations running the 527 group ayers ad a demand for a justice department investigation and just last night disruption of a radio talk show in chicago that dared have dr stanley kurtz of national review who has been examining the archives of the chicago annenberg challenge in which bill ayers and barack obama worked as colleagues

8789823 you think that the only truth that matters is that truth can be measured good intentions dont count whats in your heart doesnt count caring doesnt count but a mans life can be measured by how many tears are shed when he dies just because you cant measure them just because you dont wanna measure them doesnt mean its not real and even if im wrong youre still miserable did you really think that your lifes purpose was to sacrifice yourself and get nothing in return no you believe that there is no purpose to anything even the lives you save you dismiss you turn the one decent thing in your life and you taint it strip it of all meaning youre miserable for nothing i dont know why youd wanna live
8789824 you pretend to buck the system pretend to be a rebel claim to hate rules we see that house is pretending to sleep throughout this but all you do is substitute your own rules for societys thats a nice simple rule tell the blunt honest truth in the starkest darkest way and what will be will be what will be should be and everyone else is a coward but youre wrong someone cowardly should not call someone an idiot people arent tactful or polite just because its nice they do it because theyve got an ounce of humility because they know that they will make mistakes and they know that their actions have consequences and they know that those consequences are their fault why do you want so badly not to be human house

8789851 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well it is why i stand here tonight because for 232 years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8789852 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive because next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third and we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough now let there be no doubt the republican nominee john mccain has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect and next week well also hear about those occasions when hes broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8789853 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma we measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when bill clinton was president when the average american family saw its income go up 7 500 instead of down 2 000 like it has under george bush we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8789854 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the startups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for 26 of them in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that sen mccain took office now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stopgap measure not a long term solution not even close as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies retool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of bio fuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced

8789896 we have serious grounds to think that there were u s citizens right in the combat zone
8789897 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
8789898 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8789899 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8789900 it seems like an easy solution in reality it turns out that its not always so
8789901 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
8789902 it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8789903 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational

8789928 im encouraged that hes taken action and i also think its going to take some time
8789929 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well it is why i stand here tonight because for 232 years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8789930 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive because next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third and we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough now let there be no doubt the republican nominee john mccain has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect and next week well also hear about those occasions when hes broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8789931 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma we measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when bill clinton was president when the average american family saw its income go up 7 500 instead of down 2 000 like it has under george bush we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8789932 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the startups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for 26 of them in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that sen mccain took office now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stopgap measure not a long term solution not even close as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies retool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of bio fuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8789933 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaida and the taliban in afghanistan i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease and i will restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future

8789993 i liked the way we started the game we got control immediately and left very little doubt about the control of the game we talked to our football team about how eastern kentucky has a lot of tradition theyve won a lot of football games we didnt want to give them a lot of confidence early on we had to exert ourselves early on when you win as much as they do if you give them a spark and you give them an opportunity theyre going to fight you they fought us but we got a foothold early on controlled the football offensively got some points and defensively really limited their ability to push the ball down the field
8789994 weve got some great great receivers and great running backs and my line protected for me even though we did well we still have a lot of room to improve
8789995 grutza was the quarterback my freshman and sophomore years so theres really no difference with grutza being in there
8789996 were still comfortable with grutza out there we showed out there we didnt miss a step
8789997 its a real concern you saw our second group out there made up mostly of redshirt and true freshmen its not a good situation we cant afford to get another guy injured it gets desperate
8789998 it was unbelievable to be out there i was so nervous when i first went out there they called the first few plays and i was still kind of giddy its really different than practice against our defense you cant cut our defense is so good at swarming the ball our offensive line was cutting the defenders and the holes are there and i was just making cuts it was easy for me
8789999 im just happy they scored or i would have been angry
